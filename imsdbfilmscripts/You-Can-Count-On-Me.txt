               FADE IN:

               INT./EXT. A CAR (MOVING). NIGHT

               The shifting lights from the odd passing car play over the 
               faces of MR. and MRS. PRESCOTT, a pleasant-looking couple in 
               their late thirties, dressed up for a night out. Mr. Prescott 
               drives them along a dark hilly two-lane highway.

                                     MRS. PRESCOTT
                         Why do they always put braces on 
                         teenage girls at the exact moment 
                         when they're the most self-conscious 
                         about their appearance?

               Pause.

                                     MR. PRESCOTT
                         I don't know.

               UP AHEAD, near the top of the oncoming hill, a RED PICKUP 
               TRUCK is poking its nose out of the short exit lane.

                                     MRS. PRESCOTT
                         Tom --

                                     MR. PRESCOTT
                         I see him...

               The PICKUP LURCHES into the road, with not nearly enough 
               time to spare.

                                     MRS. PRESCOTT
                         Tom!

                                     MR. PRESCOTT
                         Jesus!

               Mr. Prescott swerves OVER the DOUBLE SOLID WHITE LINE and 
               clears the truck as --

               Another pair of HEADLIGHTS from an oncoming truck RISES UP 
               over the HILL directly in FRONT of them --

                                     MRS. PRESCOTT
                              (Screams)
                         Tom!

               Mr. Prescott's FOOT STOMPS on the BRAKE. We BLACK OUT and 
               there is the SOUND of a terrible CRASH.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE PRESCOTTS' FRONT DOOR. NIGHT

               The SHADOW of a big man looms up onto the front door. A big 
               finger RINGS the BELL.

               A moment.

               AMY, a thirteen-year-old baby-sitter with braces, opens the 
               door and looks up. In the b.g. we see TWO CHILDREN, SAMMY 
               (Samantha) and TERRY PRESCOTT, in their pajamas, lying on 
               their stomachs in the living room, watching television. Sammy 
               is eleven. Terry is eight.

               REVERSE: DARRYL, the SHERIFF, a portly fellow with glasses 
               and a mustache, looks down at AMY.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Hello, Amy.

                                     AMY
                              (Puzzled)
                         Hi, Darryl.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (Thinking)
                         Amy, would you please tell the kids 
                         you'll be right back, and then shut 
                         the door and come outside to talk to 
                         us for a minute?

                                     AMY
                         OK.
                              (To kids)
                         Be right back, you guys!

                                     SAMMY
                         You're not supposed to go out, Amy.

                                     TERRY
                         She's going to smoke a cigarette.

               AMY closes the door and looks expectantly up at Darryl. Darryl 
               doesn't know how to start.

               EXT. CHURCH. DAY

               CREDITS BEGIN OVER a blustery April day. The steeple of the 
               little white church stands out against the sharp blue sky.

               INT. TOWN CHURCH. DAY

               It's a small church and a small congregation, but it's full. 
               There's a CHOIR of mostly SENIOR CITIZENS arrayed in the 
               back. TWO CLOSED CASKETS are laid out in front of the 
               MINISTER, a fiftyish woman with thick glasses and salt-and-
               pepper hair, who is giving a eulogy MOS.

               Among the mourners in the second row sit Terry and Sammy, 
               both redeyed, and uncomfortable in their dress-up clothes. 
               Their Aunt Ruth, a pinch-faced woman in her forties, sits 
               next to them.

               Sammy and Terry are holding hands tightly. Terry wipes his 
               eyes with his free hand.

               The Minister addresses her remarks to the children. Sammy is 
               hanging on the Minister's every word; Terry is shifting his 
               eyes and his seat as if it will kill him to sit still another 
               minute.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. SCOTTSVILLE CEMETERY. SIXTEEN YEARS LATER. DAY

               On the beautiful hill overlooking the beautiful windy green 
               country, SAMMY, twenty-seven years old now, puts flowers on 
               her parents' graves with quick, practiced movements.

               She is a nice-looking young woman of a neat appearance, saved 
               from primness by an elusive, pleasantly flustered quality. 
               An unsuccessfully neat person. She is dressed in office 
               clothes -- white blouse, dark skirt, high heels, light 
               raincoat over everything. She picks out a couple of weeds 
               and then bows her head and closes her eyes.

               CREDITS END.

               EXT. SCOTTSVILLE -- MAIN STREET. DAY

               Scottsville is a small town. Main Street. Run-down old stores 
               next to a new bank, a couple of chain stores, a few 
               restaurants of varying ambitions. Civil War statue. World 
               War I statue. World War II statue. Residential streets 
               wandering away from Main Street up and down hills. You know 
               there's a minimall somewhere nearby. A fair amount of activity 
               during the daytime.

               SAMMY'S CAR pulls up across the street from where an eight-
               year-old BOY in a secondhand baseball jacket and a school 
               knapsack is waiting at the curb. This is her son, RUDY. SAMMY 
               calls out the car window.

                                     SAMMY
                         Rudy, come on! I'm really late!

               Rudy hurries across the street and gets in the car, slinging 
               his knapsack into the backseat.

               INT. THE CAR (MOVING). DAY

                                     SAMMY
                         How was school?

                                     RUDY
                         Stupid.

                                     SAMMY
                         Why do you say that?

                                     RUDY
                         We're supposed to write a story for 
                         English homework, but they didn't 
                         tell us what it's supposed to be 
                         about.

                                     SAMMY
                         What do you mean?

                                     RUDY
                         I mean they didn't tell us what it's 
                         supposed to be about. They said do 
                         whatever you want.

                                     SAMMY
                         So what's wrong with that?

                                     RUDY
                         Nothing. I just think it's 
                         unstructured.

                                     SAMMY
                              (Smiles)
                         Well, I'm sure you'll be able to 
                         think of something. If you can't, 
                         I'll help you.

               INT./EXT. CAR/CAROL'S HOUSE. DAY

               Sammy stops the car outside a heavily THICKETED DRIVEWAY 
               (CAROL'S HOUSE), and RUDY gets out.

                                     SAMMY
                         Don't forget your backpack.

               Rudy returns to take his knapsack out of the back.

                                     RUDY
                         It's not a backpack, it's a knapsack.

                                     SAMMY
                         Don't forget your knapsack.

               Rudy hoists his knapsack out of the back.

                                     SAMMY
                         Give me a kiss.

               Rudy gives her a kiss and puts his arms around her and 
               squeezes her neck.

               He withdraws, slams the door. As Sammy DRIVES AWAY, he slogs 
               up the long twisting driveway.

               EXT. MERCHANTS NATIONAL TRUST -- PARKING LOT. DAY

               Sammy gets out of her car, which is parked in one of the 
               half dozen spaces in the little parking lot allocated for 
               bank employees.

               She hurries toward the employees' entrance, fixing her skirt 
               as she goes.

               INT. MERCHANTS NATIONAL TRUST. DAY

               Sammy hurries down the clean hallway in the back past MABEL, 
               a pleasant-faced fellow employee.

                                     MABEL
                         Guess who's been asking for you?

                                     SAMMY
                         Oh no, really?

               Mabel nods and passes by.

               SAMMY KNOCKS on a big door that says "Manager" and has half 
               the letters of the previous branch manager's name taken off 
               it.

                                     BRIAN
                              (Inside)
                         Yeah, come in!

               Sammy swings open the door. BRIAN EVERETT, the new branch 
               manager, is unpacking a box. Sammy is surprised to see he is 
               in his early thirties and very good-looking in a boyish sort 
               of way; he wears shirt-sleeves and tie, and a wedding ring.

                                     SAMMY
                         Mr. Everett?

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah: Brian.

                                     SAMMY
                         Brian. Hi. I'm Samantha Prescott -- 
                         I'm the lending officer?

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah, hi, how are you? Come on in. 
                         Sit down.

               Sammy comes into the office and sits.

                                     SAMMY
                         I am so sorry I was late...

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah, we missed you before...

                                     SAMMY
                         I got held up. Believe me, it is not 
                         something I make a habit of...

                                     BRIAN
                         I'm sure it's not. Actually -- could 
                         you just, could you close that door 
                         for me? Thanks.

               Sammy gets up and closes the door.

               INT. BRIAN'S OFFICE. LATER

               Sammy sits in front of Brian's desk. Brian is behind the 
               desk listening.

                                     SAMMY
                         -- so I always just run out at 3:15 
                         to pick him up and then run him real 
                         quick over to the sitter's house. 
                         Anyway, Larry never minded about it 
                         and I was just hoping it would be OK 
                         with you too...

                                     BRIAN
                         Well -- Samantha -- I realize that 
                         Scottsville is not exactly a major 
                         banking center...

                                     SAMMY
                         No it's not...

                                     BRIAN
                         No -- I know it's not... But it's 
                         kind of a personal challenge to me 
                         to see what we can do to bring local 
                         service up to the same kinds of 
                         standards we'd be trying to meet if 
                         we were the biggest branch in the 
                         state. And that means I don't want 
                         anybody running out at 3:15 or 3:30, 
                         or whenever the bus happens to come 
                         in that day. Now is there anybody 
                         else who can pick your son up after 
                         school? Does your husband work in 
                         the area? Do you --

                                     SAMMY
                         Oh -- No -- Rudy Sr. isn't "on the 
                         scene." So to speak.

                                     BRIAN
                         Well, I can give you a couple of 
                         days to make some other arrangement, 
                         but...

                                     SAMMY
                         Well -- Brian? I understand what 
                         you're saying, and I think it's great. 
                         I do. Because there's a lot of things 
                         around here that could use some 
                         attention. Believe me. But I've 
                         honestly been meeting that bus every 
                         day for four years now and it really 
                         does take just fifteen minutes, and 
                         if I take the time out of my lunch 
                         hour...

                                     BRIAN
                         I'd really prefer it if you would 
                         make some other arrangement. OK?

                                     SAMMY
                              (Brightly)
                         I'll do my best...!

               Brian kicks back in his chair and puts his hands behind his 
               head.

                                     BRIAN
                         How old's your son?

                                     SAMMY
                         He's eight.

                                     BRIAN
                         That's a terrific age.

               INT. SAMMY'S CAR (MOVING). DUSK

               Sammy and Rudy drive home in silence. The orange sunlight 
               flickers through the trees and onto their faces as they drive 
               along.

               EXT. PRESCOTT (SAMMY'S) HOUSE. DUSK

               The same house that Sammy grew up in, with sixteen years' 
               more wear on it.

               Sammy's car swings expertly by the mailbox, and Rudy reaches 
               half his body out of the passenger window and gets the mail.

               INT. SAMMY'S HOUSE. DUSK

               Sammy comes into the house carrying two bags of groceries. 
               Rudy follows, looking through the mail. Sammy passes through 
               the house and goes into the kitchen.

                                     RUDY
                         You got a letter from Uncle Terry.

                                     SAMMY
                         What?!

               Her whole face lights up and she grabs the letter. She tears 
               it open and reads it with growing excitement.

               INT. SAMMY'S BEDROOM. LATER

               Sammy opens her FILE DRAWER. Inside are tax files, household 
               files, miscellaneous files.

               She puts Terry's letter away in a very full file marked "Terry -- 
               Correspondence." The folder is stuffed with other letters, 
               on all different kinds of stationery from all over the 
               country, all from Terry.

               INT. DINING ROOM. NIGHT

               Sammy and Rudy are eating dinner. It's a biggish house for 
               just two people.

                                     RUDY
                         Whose room is he gonna stay in?

                                     SAMMY
                         He can stay in the little room.
                              (Pause)
                         But you know what? He's not going to 
                         live here. He's only gonna stay for 
                         a little while... And it's OK if you 
                         don't remember him, because you were 
                         only six the last time he was here... 
                         But it'll be nice if you got a chance 
                         to get to know each other a little 
                         bit. Don't you think?

               Rudy looks worried and doesn't answer.

               INT. LIVING ROOM. LATER

               Rudy is on the floor, writing in his school composition 
               notebook. Sammy comes downstairs.

                                     SAMMY
                         Rudy? Would it distract you if I put 
                         on some music?

                                     RUDY
                         No.

               She puts on a CD, sits down and picks up a book. She looks 
               at Rudy, who is writing away.

                                     SAMMY
                         Did you think of a story?

                                     RUDY
                         Uh huh.

                                     SAMMY
                         What's it about?

                                     RUDY
                         My father.

               Pause.

                                     SAMMY
                         What about your father?

                                     RUDY
                         It's just a made-up story about him.

                                     SAMMY
                         Can I read it when you're done?

                                     RUDY
                         It's not very good.

                                     SAMMY
                         Don't say that.

               Rudy keeps writing.

               INT. LIVING ROOM. LATER

               Sammy is smoking a cigarette and drinking a glass of wine 
               and reading Rudy's story. It upsets her.

               INT. SAMMY'S BEDROOM. LATER

               Sammy sits on the edge of her bed, not dialing the phone. 
               She catches a glimpse of herself in her parents' floor-length 
               mirror with the worn, heavy wooden frame. Against her better 
               judgment she picks up the phone and dials.

               INT. DAWSON'S GRILL. NIGHT

               Sammy and BOB STEEGERSON are eating dinner at Dawson's, the 
               only fancy restaurant in town. Bob is in his mid-thirties, a 
               Realtor, a decent, ordinary guy.

                                     SAMMY
                         Anyway, Bob, it's sort of this 
                         adventure story, and Rudy's father 
                         is this secret agent or something, 
                         working for the government... And it 
                         just made me feel weird. You know? 
                         Because I never really say much to 
                         him about Rudy Sr., because I don't 
                         know what to say. And I don't know 
                         whether I should just let him imagine 
                         whatever he wants to imagine, or 
                         whether I should sit him down sometime 
                         and tell him, you know, that his 
                         father is not such a nice person. 
                         You know?

                                     BOB
                         Well... I don't know, Sammy. What 
                         have you told him already?

                                     SAMMY
                         Not much. He knows I don't have the 
                         highest opinion of him. And he knows 
                         I don't want to see him or know 
                         anything about him, ever. But I tried 
                         to keep it kind of neutral. Anyway... 
                         I could go into a lot more detail, 
                         believe me.

                                     BOB
                         Well... It's an interesting problem. 
                         But I don't really know what to tell 
                         you... It's a little outside my 
                         personal field of expertise...

                                     SAMMY
                         All right.

                                     BOB
                         I'd be glad to give it some thought...

                                     SAMMY
                         OK.

               He is smiling at her.

                                     SAMMY
                         What?

                                     BOB
                         Nothing... I'm just glad to see you... 
                         I'm glad you called me.

                                     SAMMY
                         I bet you were surprised...!

                                     BOB
                         Um -- a little.

               Bob drains his wineglass. Sammy cuts at her steak.

               INT. BOB'S BEDROOM. NIGHT

               Sammy and Bob lie in Bob's bed, a few minutes after having 
               made love. They are very far away from each other, but trying 
               with difficulty not to let on.

                                     SAMMY
                         I should get going...

                                     BOB
                         Really?

                                     SAMMY
                         Yeah... I've got the baby-sitter... 
                         But... Thanks for a lovely evening.

                                     BOB
                         Oh. Thank you.

               She kisses him. She tries to make it sexy, but he's not into 
               it anymore and he politely restricts the kissing.

               INT. SAMMY'S BATHROOM. NIGHT

               Sammy stands in her slip brushing her teeth in front of the 
               mirror. She brushes vigorously, looking at herself while she 
               brushes.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. STREET CORNER -- WORCESTER, MASS. DAWN

               The corner window of a grim little apartment building on a 
               very grim street in a grim little city.

               INT. TERRY'S APARTMENT -- WORCESTER, MASS. NIGHT

               A tiny apartment with a bed, chair, table, fridge, and not 
               much else. One window has a broken pane and an old sheet 
               neatly thumbtacked over it to keep the wind out.

               TERRY PRESCOTT comes in. He is twenty-five years old: a real 
               mess with a certain natural appeal. He wears old jeans, very 
               old hiking boots, and a lumberjack-style coat. He takes a 
               wool hat off his head. His hair is longish and dirty.

               SHEILA SADLER is sitting at the table by the fridge. She is 
               barely eighteen, frail and damaged.

                                     SHEILA
                         Hey, Terry.

                                     TERRY
                         Hey.

               Terry looks at her and smiles encouragingly. She smiles back.

                                     SHEILA
                         Where'd you get the hat?

                                     TERRY
                         Oh, I got it on the street for a 
                         dollar.

                                     SHEILA
                         It's nice.

                                     TERRY
                         Well, you know, it's pretty much 
                         your standard woolen hat.

                                     SHEILA
                         Yeah, I had a very similar reaction 
                         to it.

               Sheila looks away. Silence.

                                     TERRY
                         Can I get that money from you?

                                     SHEILA
                         Yeah. Sorry.

               As she opens her purse, Terry takes a few vague steps toward 
               her. She takes out a tiny hippie-ish woven wallet and gives 
               Terry all the money in it: a twenty and two ones.

                                     TERRY
                         Is that all you have?

                                     SHEILA
                         Yeah.

                                     TERRY
                         Can you borrow some cash from your 
                         brother?

                                     SHEILA
                         Um, yeah, but that would involve 
                         speaking to him.

                                     TERRY
                         Well, I'm definitely gonna be gone 
                         for a couple of days at least, Sheila.

                                     SHEILA
                         Why do you have to stay so long?

                                     TERRY
                         Because my sister is not a bank, you 
                         know? I can't just show up and ask 
                         her for --

                                     SHEILA
                         You seem to think my brother's a 
                         bank!

                                     TERRY
                         Oh Sheila can we just cut out the 
                         puerile crap?! I'll be back just as 
                         soon as I can. OK? I am not the kind 
                         of man that everyone says I am.

                                     SHEILA
                         I know you're not.

                                     TERRY
                         I'll call you tonight.

               Pause.

                                     SHEILA
                         Don't you wanna tell me you love me?

                                     TERRY
                         I love you.

                                     SHEILA
                         That was really convincing.

                                     TERRY
                         Well... I think after this is over 
                         you should seriously consider moving 
                         back home.

                                     SHEILA
                              (Short laugh)
                         Oh, yeah.

                                     TERRY
                              (Gives up)
                         All right...

                                     SHEILA
                         You gonna call tonight?

                                     TERRY
                         Definitely.

               She puts her arms around him and holds on.

               EXT. NEW YORK STATE -- MOUNTAINS -- HIGHWAY. DAY

               Wide open shot of hilly country and a big sky overhead. A 
               GREYHOUND BUS drives into the shot along the curve of the 
               highway.

               INT. BUS (MOVING) -- BATHROOM. DAY

               Terry is seated on the toilet seat in the cramped bathroom 
               smoking a joint. He takes a huge hit and holds it in for as 
               long as humanly possible. He blows out what's left, takes 
               another equally huge hit and holds it in.

               EXT. LOCAL HIGHWAY. DAY

               The BUS WHOOSHES along a smaller, heavily wooded roller-
               coaster road.

               INT. BUS (MOVING). DAY

               Terry looks out the window at the passing scenery. The 
               sunlight flickers on his face.

               POV TERRY: The bus rolls past the hilltop cemetery.

               Terry shifts uncomfortably in his seat.

               POV TERRY: THE "WELCOME TO SCOTTSVILLE" SIGN whizzes by. 
               Houses start dotting the side of the road.

               Terry starts getting very agitated.

               EXT. MAIN STREET. DAY

               Terry stands at one end of Main Street, backpack over his 
               shoulder, as the BUS DRIVES OFF. He looks around at the town 
               going about its Saturday afternoon business.

               INT. KITCHEN. SIMULTANEOUS

               Loud country-western music is blaring as Sammy, wearing an 
               apron, sets a big vase of flowers on the kitchen table and 
               hurries to the oven. There are also cookies, a pie, evidence 
               of massive fancy cooking. She puts on her oven mitts and 
               takes a lasagna out of the oven, as the phone rings. She 
               picks up.

                                     SAMMY
                              (Into phone)
                         Hello?... TERRY!...

               EXT. SAMMY'S HOUSE. DAY

               Sammy practically bursts out the front door. She has changed 
               into nice clothes.

               EXT. ALLEY. DAY

               Terry secrets himself in a small dark alley. He takes out 
               his carefully wrapped half joint and lights it. SMOKING, he 
               looks at the sunlit slant of street beyond the alley.

               EXT. MAIN STREET. A FEW MOMENTS LATER

               Terry, fairly well stoned, walks along Main Street. A skinny 
               man emerges from his hardware store to greet Terry and shake 
               hands. Terry says "Hi," but keeps on walking. He passes some 
               other people.

               He almost runs right into SHERIFF DARRYL, sixteen years fatter 
               and grayer.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Whoa there!

                                     TERRY
                         Sorry.

               The Sheriff recognizes Terry and breaks into a big smile.

                                     SHERIFF
                         God damn! Terry Prescott! How you 
                         doin'? Gimme a cuddle!

               The Sheriff gives Terry a big bear hug. Terry is wasted and 
               selfconscious but smiling. He pats the Sheriff's back.

                                     TERRY
                         How you doin', Darryl?

                                     SHERIFF
                         Which way you headed?

                                     TERRY
                         I'm just goin' to see Sammy at 
                         Dawson's...

                                     SHERIFF
                         Can I walk with you a little?

                                     TERRY
                         Sure, yeah --

                                     SHERIFF
                         So Sammy says you been out in 
                         Alaska...?

                                     TERRY
                         Yeah, I was workin' out there for a 
                         little while...

               EXT. MAIN STREET. A FEW MOMENTS LATER

               The Sheriff walks along with Terry. Terry, very self-conscious 
               about smelling like pot, fumbles to light a cigarette. The 
               Sheriff does not seem to notice.

                                     SHERIFF
                         -- Sammy says she's gettin' postcards 
                         from all across the country.

                                     TERRY
                         Yeah, I've been all over the place...

               They stop outside Dawson's.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Well, it's good to have you back 
                         here, I'll tell you that.

                                     TERRY
                         Thanks, Darryl. Keep enforcing the 
                         peace.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Well, that'll be a little harder now 
                         that you're home, but I'll do what I 
                         can.

                                     TERRY
                         No, man, I'm reformed.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Oh, yeah. Good to see you, kid.

                                     TERRY
                         Thanks, Darryl.

               Darryl walks away. Terry stands outside the restaurant looking 
               for Sammy.

               Behind him in the restaurant Sammy is sitting at a table, 
               talking to the waitress.

               She sees Terry and gets up immediately, smiling like crazy 
               as she threads her way through the tables toward the door.

               Terry turns and sees her. He breaks into a big smile, tosses 
               his cigarette and goes into the restaurant. Through the window 
               we see them make their way toward each other.

               Sammy throws her arms around him. He hugs her back with a 
               big involuntary smile as the GLASS DOOR slowly CLOSES.

               INT. DAWSON'S -- AT THEIR TABLE. A FEW MOMENTS LATER

               Terry is studying the menu, over-intently. Sammy is beaming 
               at him.

                                     TERRY
                         Sorry about yesterday --

                                     SAMMY
                         I don't care --

                                     TERRY
                         I was studying the bus description... 
                         and I just... I got on the wrong bus -- 
                         I mean I missed my stop --

                                     SAMMY
                         I don't care, Terry. I'm just so 
                         glad to see you...!

                                     TERRY
                         I'm glad to see you too, Sammy. Um... 
                         are you coming from work?

                                     SAMMY
                         Um, no, it's Saturday...

                                     TERRY
                         Yeah, no, it's just... you're dressed 
                         so formally...

                                     SAMMY
                         Oh. No. You know, I just thought I'd -- 
                         You know I thought it was a special 
                         occasion... which it is...

                                     TERRY
                         No, it's good. I thought I'd dress 
                         up too.

               He gestures to his shitty clothes.

                                     SAMMY
                         That's OK. You look fine.

                                     TERRY
                              (A strange, 
                              unsuccessful joke)
                         Yeah, this is the haute cuisine of 
                         garments.

                                     SAMMY
                         What?

                                     TERRY
                         Nothing, nothing... Um... So how are 
                         you?

                                     SAMMY
                         I'm fine.

                                     TERRY
                         How's Rudy?

                                     SAMMY
                         We're fine, Terry. How are you?
                              (Pause)
                         I mean --

                                     TERRY
                         Yeah...

                                     SAMMY
                         -- Where have you been lately, Terry?

                                     TERRY
                         -- I know, I haven't been --

                                     SAMMY
                         I got a postcard from you from 
                         Alaska...?

                                     TERRY
                         Yeah, I was up there for a while...

                                     SAMMY
                         But that was in the Fall, Terry...

                                     TERRY
                         Yeah, I know I've been out of touch...

                                     SAMMY
                         I was a little worried.
                              (Pause)
                         I mean --

                                     TERRY
                         Oh, I been a lotta different places... 
                         Um... I went down to Florida for a 
                         while... I was doing some work in 
                         Orlando... I've been all over the 
                         place.

                                     SAMMY
                         Well... I just wish you would have 
                         let me know you were OK...

                                     TERRY
                         Yeah. I didn't realize it'd been so 
                         long...

               He looks around the restaurant.

                                     SAMMY
                              (Beaming again)
                         Are you gonna stay in town for a 
                         while?

                                     TERRY
                         Well, I don't know... I got all these 
                         things I gotta do back in Worcester...

                                     SAMMY
                         Oh...

                                     TERRY
                         ...Yeah, so I'm probably not gonna 
                         be able to stay more than a day or 
                         so...

                                     SAMMY
                         Oh... Well... That's all right...!

                                     TERRY
                         ...I'm kind of trying to keep to a 
                         schedule of sorts. It's a long and 
                         worthy story but I won't trouble you 
                         with it right now.

               He twists around and looks all over the restaurant. She 
               watches him.

                                     SAMMY
                         Are you expecting someone?

                                     TERRY
                         Who would I be expecting here?

                                     SAMMY
                         You just keep looking around, that's 
                         all.

                                     TERRY
                         No, I was just wondering if we could 
                         get some more refreshments, actually.

               He laughs. Looks down. Silence. He looks up at her.

                                     TERRY
                         I've actually got to confess to you, 
                         Sammy... that the reason you may not 
                         have heard from me for a little while 
                         is that I've been kind of unable to 
                         write... on account of the fact that 
                         I was in jail for a little while.

                                     SAMMY
                         You were what?

               A couple of people in the restaurant look at them. Terry 
               notices but Sammy does not.

                                     TERRY
                         Well, I did a little time, I guess, 
                         in Florida. For, uh, just for 
                         bullshit...

                                     SAMMY
                         What?!

                                     TERRY
                         It was just bullshit...

                                     SAMMY
                         What did you do?

                                     TERRY
                         I didn't do anything. Does it occur 
                         to you that maybe I was wronged?

                                     SAMMY
                         No!

                                     TERRY
                         Well, could I please --

                                     SAMMY
                         Oh my God! --

                                     TERRY
                         Would you please let me --

                                     SAMMY
                         -- What happened?!

                                     TERRY
                         I got into a fight in a bar down in 
                         Florida. Which I was not the one who 
                         instigated it, at all. But they worked 
                         up all this bullshit against me and 
                         they threw me in the pen for three 
                         months. I didn't write you because I 
                         didn't want you to get all upset 
                         about it. I just figured you'd figure 
                         I was on the road for a little while. 
                         I know it was stupid and I'm sorry. 
                         I really didn't mean to make you 
                         worry. But you know what? I can't 
                         run around all the time doin' stuff 
                         or not doin' stuff because it's gonna 
                         make you worry! Because then I come 
                         back here, and I tell you about my 
                         fuckin'... traumas, and I get this 
                         wounded little "I've Let You Down" 
                         bullshit, over and over again, and 
                         it really just -- cramps me! Like I 
                         just want to get out from under it!... 
                         And here I am back in this fuckin' 
                         hole explaining myself to you again!

                                     SAMMY
                         OK -- Can you please stop cursing at 
                         me?

                                     TERRY
                         I mean, I realize I'm in no position 
                         to, uh, basically say anything, ever -- 
                         But it's not like I'm down there in 
                         some redneck bar in Florida having 
                         an argument with some stripper's 
                         boyfriend and I suddenly think, "Hey! 
                         Maybe this'd be a good time to really 
                         stick it to Sammy and get myself 
                         locked up for a few months."

                                     SAMMY
                         I'm sorry.

                                     TERRY
                         Me too, man. I mean "welcome home."

                                     SAMMY
                         Hey -- You don't write me for six 
                         months, I have no idea where you are --

                                     TERRY
                         I'm sorry --

                                     SAMMY
                         -- I don't know if you're alive or 
                         dead --

                                     TERRY
                         I'm sorry --

                                     SAMMY
                         -- and then you show up out of nowhere 
                         and tell me you were in jail?

                                     TERRY
                         I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, 
                         Sammy, I'm really sorry...!

               The patrons are all either looking at them or trying not to 
               look. Silence.

                                     TERRY
                         Sammy...

                                     SAMMY
                         What?

                                     TERRY
                         Um... I'm in the midst of a slight 
                         predicament...

                                     SAMMY
                         What do you need? Money?

                                     TERRY
                         Um... Yeah... I'm broke. I gotta get 
                         back to Worcester tomorrow. I got 
                         this girl there, and she's kind of 
                         in a bad situation...? I just need 
                         to borrow some money. Whatever you 
                         can spare.
                              (Pause)
                         I'll pay you back... I'll pay you 
                         back, man.

                                     SAMMY
                         I really wish Mom was here.

                                     TERRY
                         So do I, man.

                                     SAMMY
                         Nobody knows what to do with you.

                                     TERRY
                         I know how they feel, man.

               Silence, except for the sounds of the restaurant.

                                     SAMMY
                         Terry? Can I ask you something?

                                     TERRY
                         Sure.

                                     SAMMY
                              (With some difficulty)
                         Well -- I mean, do you ever go to 
                         church anymore?

                                     TERRY
                         Come on, Sammy, can we not talk about 
                         that shit?

                                     SAMMY
                         Do you?

                                     TERRY
                         Um -- No, Sammy. I don't.

                                     SAMMY
                         Can you tell me why not?

                                     TERRY
                         Um, yeah. Because I think it's 
                         ridiculous.

                                     SAMMY
                         Well -- can you tell me without like, 
                         denigrating what I believe in?

                                     TERRY
                         Because I think it's primitive, OK? 
                         I think it's a fairy tale.

                                     SAMMY
                         Well -- I mean, have you ever 
                         considered that maybe that's part of 
                         what's making things so difficult 
                         for you?

                                     TERRY
                         No.

                                     SAMMY
                         -- That you've lost hold of -- well, 
                         not just your religious feeling, but 
                         lost hold of any kind of anchor, any 
                         kind of trust in anything... I mean 
                         no wonder you drift around so much. 
                         What could ever stop you? How would 
                         you ever know if you had found the 
                         right thing?

                                     TERRY
                         Well, uh, I'm not really looking for 
                         anything, man. I'm just, like, trying 
                         to get on with it.

               The WAITRESS approaches with their salads.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Here we go...

               She sets them down on the table.

               SAMMY and TERRY Thank you.

               The WAITRESS leaves. Silence. Terry picks at his salad. Sammy 
               doesn't touch hers. She watches him miserably.

               EXT. BANK -- ATM. DAY

               Terry watches while Sammy inserts her card in the ATM and 
               punches in her code. Terry waits. She punches in $300. The 
               machine grinds out her cash. She gives him the money.

                                     TERRY
                         Thank you, Sammy... I'm really gonna 
                         pay this back.

               She takes her card back and puts it back in her wallet.

               INT. SAMMY'S CAR. DAY

               Sammy and Terry get in the car. Sammy isn't saying anything.

                                     TERRY
                         Where we going?

                                     SAMMY
                         To pick up Rudy.

               She puts on her glasses and her seat belt. She won't look at 
               him.

                                     TERRY
                         Well... do you not even want me to 
                         visit now? 'Cause I can catch the 
                         bus at five o'clock if that's what 
                         you want.

                                     SAMMY
                         Well, of course I want you to visit, 
                         you idiot! I've been looking forward 
                         to seeing you more than anything! 
                         I've been telling everyone I know 
                         that you were coming home! I cleaned 
                         the whole fucking house so it would 
                         look nice for you! I thought you 
                         were gonna stay for at least a few 
                         days! It didn't occur to me that you 
                         were just broke again. I wish you 
                         would have just sent me an invoice!

               She stops. Terry is now totally contrite.

               INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT

               Terry sits in the tub. Water drips from the faucet. He is 
               staring blankly up at the pristine blue-and-white tiled wall 
               and the neatly folded matching towels.

               INT. LIVING ROOM. LATER

               Sammy and Rudy are in the living room. Rudy is playing with 
               a Game Boy type game. In the b.g., TERRY is dialing the PHONE. 
               He looks clean and shaved, his hair is neatly combed.

                                     TERRY
                              (Into phone)
                         Hi, is that Malcolm?... Hi, this is 
                         Terry Prescott?... I been trying to 
                         get ahold of Sheila and there's no 
                         answer, and I was just wondering if 
                         she -- She what?...

               He sits down.

                                     TERRY
                              (Into phone)
                         When?... Well -- Is she all right?... 
                         Well, could I talk to her?... Well, 
                         could you give her a message that I --

               CLICK. He is hung up on. He slowly HANGS UP.

               Sammy notices that something's wrong. He looks at her from 
               across the room.

                                     TERRY
                         That girl I'm with tried to kill 
                         herself.

                                     SAMMY
                         What?

                                     TERRY
                         She tried to kill herself.

               INT. TERRY'S ROOM. NIGHT

               Terry is sitting on the bed, addressing an envelope to SHEILA. 
               He puts the $300 in the ENVELOPE and seals it. He sees Sammy 
               standing in the doorway. He starts to unlace his boots.

                                     SAMMY
                         Do you have everything you need?

                                     TERRY
                         I think so.

               Sammy comes into the room and sits next to him. He is very 
               busy with his laces.

                                     SAMMY
                         What are you going to do?

                                     TERRY
                         I don't know. Send the money I guess.

                                     SAMMY
                         Maybe you should stay home for a 
                         little while, Terry.

                                     TERRY
                         Yeah, maybe that'd be a good idea.

               He starts crying. Sammy pats him.

               EXT. SCOTTSVILLE CHURCH. DAY

               A bright, clear, blue-skied Sunday morning in Scottsville. 
               Inside the little white church they're singing.

               EXT. CHURCH. DAY

               People are filing out of the church. We also see a couple of 
               the bank employees, including BRIAN and his very pretty six 
               months' PREGNANT wife, NANCY. We find SAMMY and RUDY. Sammy 
               is chatting to some neighbors. Rudy is bored out of his mind, 
               waiting for her.

               INT. SAMMY'S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM. DAY

               Terry is lying on the sofa, smoking, with his feet up and 
               boots on, watching Sunday morning TV. On the coffee table 
               are his dirty ashtray, dirty bowl and spoon, Rice Krispies 
               box and a milk carton.

               EXT. SAMMY'S HOUSE. NIGHT

               Crickets buzz loudly outside the house.

               INT. STAIRS. NIGHT

               Sammy, in her bathrobe, comes down the stairs into the living 
               room. Terry is on the sofa playing with Rudy's Game Boy. He 
               barely looks up when she speaks to him.

                                     SAMMY
                         I'm going to bed. Do you have 
                         everything you need?

                                     TERRY
                         Yeah. Thanks.

                                     SAMMY
                         Good night.

                                     TERRY
                         Good night.

               Pause.

                                     SAMMY
                         Terry, I'm really glad you're home.

               Terry tries to smile at her.

                                     TERRY
                         Yeah, me too, Sammy.

               He goes back to his game. She hesitates, then heads back up 
               the stairs.

               INT. SAMMY'S KITCHEN. DAY

               Sammy, Terry and Rudy sit at the kitchen table. Sammy is 
               dressed for work. Rudy is dressed for school. Terry is also 
               fully dressed, drinking the last dregs of a mug of coffee. 
               He is tired, but listening to Sammy very carefully, as if 
               receiving difficult and critical instructions.

                                     SAMMY
                         OK. So we'll drop Rudy off at the 
                         bus, then all you have to do is drop 
                         me off at the bank, and just pick 
                         Rudy up at 3:30 in front of town 
                         hall, and drive him over to Carol's 
                         house. And that's it. She's on Harvey 
                         Lane, right past where the Dewitts 
                         used to live.

                                     TERRY
                         OK.

                                     SAMMY
                         Rudy knows where she lives.

               Terry glances at Rudy, then back at Sammy.

                                     TERRY
                         OK.

               INT. BANK -- MABEL'S DESK. DAY

               Sammy walks past MABEL'S DESK, carrying a big stack of files. 
               She drops three of them on the desk. MABEL is typing away at 
               her PC. The colors are a garish PURPLE background with GREEN 
               letters.

                                     SAMMY
                         God, Mabel, don't those colors hurt 
                         your eyes?

                                     MABEL
                         Oh no, they keep me fresh.

               Sammy proceeds down the hall and into --

               INT. BRIAN'S OFFICE. DAY

               Brian is at his desk, busy working between stacks of papers. 
               She knocks on the open door.

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah!
                              (Looks up)
                         Hi, Sammy. What can I do for you?

                                     SAMMY
                         Um, Brian? Did you want us to turn 
                         this time sheet in at the end of the 
                         day, or do you want it at the end of 
                         the week...?

                                     BRIAN
                         Oh, yeah, end of the day'll be fine.

                                     SAMMY
                         Seems like an awful lot of extra 
                         paperwork...

               Brian hesitates, shrugs and smiles.

                                     BRIAN
                         I like paperwork.

               Sammy looks at him with a blank smile.

               INT. BANK -- SAMMY'S DESK. A MOMENT LATER

               Sammy sits down at her desk and notices the time: 3:30. She 
               reaches for the phone, then decides not to call.

               EXT. SCOTTSVILLE -- MAIN STREET. DAY

               The CLOCK on the front of the TOWN HALL reads 3:31.

               The SCHOOL BUS pulls up across from the town hall and 
               disgorges a handful of kids. Rudy comes out with his knapsack, 
               looking around...

               POV RUDY: Terry, across the street, sits on the hood of 
               Sammy's car, smoking.

               Rudy walks over to him.

                                     RUDY
                         You showed up.

                                     TERRY
                         Looks that way.

               INT. SAMMY'S CAR (MOVING). DAY

               Terry and Rudy drive in silence. Terry glances at Rudy.

                                     TERRY
                         Put on your seat belt.

                                     RUDY
                         It pushes on my neck.

                                     TERRY
                         What?

                                     RUDY
                         It pushes on my neck. It's 
                         uncomfortable.

                                     TERRY
                         Well, when somebody slams into us 
                         and you go sailin' through the 
                         windshield, that's liable to be 
                         uncomfortable too. So put on your 
                         seat belt.

               Rudy puts on his seat belt.

                                     RUDY
                         Mom's parents died in a car accident.

                                     TERRY
                         I know. They're my parents too.

                                     RUDY
                         They are?

                                     TERRY
                         Well, yeah. Your mom is my sister.

                                     RUDY
                         Yeah, I know.

                                     TERRY
                         So that means we have the same 
                         parents.

                                     RUDY
                         Oh yeah.

               They drive in silence for a moment. Terry glances down at 
               Rudy.

               INT. BANK -- SAMMY'S DESK. DAY

               Sammy, laden with files, plops down at her desk as Mabel is 
               passing by. Mabel puts a phone message down in front of her.

                                     MABEL
                         Um -- Carol just called. She said 
                         Terry and Rudy never showed up at 
                         her house?

                                     SAMMY
                         You've got to be kidding me.

               A MOMENT LATER: Brian, talking to an employee, sees Sammy, 
               across the bank, hurrying out the employees' exit.

                                     BRIAN
                         Hey, Sammy?

               Sammy doesn't hear and exits.

               EXT. ORRIN'S BACKYARD. DAY

               Terry and Rudy are banging nails with RAY, a young guy Terry's 
               age. Terry, hammering with swift, accurate blows, glances up 
               and watches Rudy for a second. Rudy is hammering away with 
               no great skill.

                                     TERRY
                         Hey. Look.

               He moves Rudy's hand down toward the end of the handle.

                                     TERRY
                         You hold it further down, you're 
                         gonna get a lot more power. You should 
                         be able to put that nail down with 
                         two or three hits. Look:

               With two swift strokes he drives the nail flush into the 
               wood.

                                     TERRY
                         Try it.

                                     RUDY
                         That's not the way I hold it.

                                     TERRY
                         Well, the way you hold it is wrong.

                                     RUDY
                         Why can't I just do it my own way?

               Terry looks at him unsympathetically for a moment.

                                     TERRY
                              (Shrugs)
                         You can.

               He goes back to work. Rudy resumes hammering. After a moment 
               he switches his grip and starts hammering Terry's way. Terry 
               looks up and watches him.

               EXT. IN FRONT OF ORRIN'S HOUSE. A MOMENT LATER

               Sammy pulls up, fast, and gets out of the car. Hearing the 
               hammering from the backyard, she walks quickly around the 
               side of the house and stops short when she sees Rudy hammering 
               happily away with Terry and Ray.

               She watches them working, unobserved, with mixed annoyance 
               and relief, and finally with quiet pleasure, because it's a 
               very cheerful sight.

               INT. BANK. DAY

               Half the staff has gone home. Sammy, in her coat, picks a 
               NOTE up off her CHAIR. It reads:

               "SAMMY, PLEASE SEE ME A.S.A.P!!! -- BRIAN"

               INT. BRIAN'S OFFICE. A MOMENT LATER

               Sammy stands in front of Brian's desk.

                                     SAMMY
                         Brian? Did you want to see me?

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah. I was kind of wondering what 
                         happened to you today.

                                     SAMMY
                         Oh -- Didn't Mabel -- I had a false 
                         alarm about my son...

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah, I kind of thought you were 
                         gonna work that out.

                                     SAMMY
                         Well, I did work it out -- more or 
                         less --

                                     BRIAN
                         Then why're you running outta here 
                         in the middle of the day without a 
                         word of explanation to me, Sammy?

                                     SAMMY
                         Brian, don't yell at me.

                                     BRIAN
                         I'm -- I'm not yelling. I'm just 
                         gettin' a little frustrated here.

                                     SAMMY
                         Well Brian:

                                     BRIAN
                         Sorry, could you close the door 
                         please?

               Sammy closes the door.

               INT. DINING ROOM. NIGHT

               Sammy, Terry and Rudy sit at dinner. The atmosphere is lively 
               and cheerful.

                                     SAMMY
                         ...And Eddy Dwyer lives in Buffalo, 
                         with his wife and two sons, if you 
                         can believe it.

                                     TERRY
                         That is depressing.

                                     SAMMY
                         Why?

                                     TERRY
                         He just never struck me as the 
                         marrying type, that's all.

                                     RUDY
                         Who are you talking about?

                                     TERRY
                         Wild kids we used to know.

                                     RUDY
                         Were you a wild kid?

                                     TERRY
                         Not compared to your Mom.

                                     RUDY
                         Yeah, right.

                                     TERRY
                         You don't believe me?

                                     RUDY
                         No.

                                     TERRY
                         Ask her.

                                     RUDY
                         Mom, were you?

                                     SAMMY
                         No comment.

               Rudy is amazed. Terry looks at him like, "Told you so."

               INT. SAMMY'S BEDROOM. NIGHT

               Sammy is asleep in bed.

               INT. RUDY'S BEDROOM. NIGHT

               Rudy is asleep in bed.

               INT. BAR. NIGHT

               Terry sits at the bar, drinking beer. There are a few locals 
               in the place, but it's pretty dead. He looks around; his 
               energy is too restless for the near-empty bar.

               INT. RUDY'S BEDROOM. NIGHT

               The DOOR OPENS, and TERRY COMES IN, smoking a cigarette. 
               He's plastered. He looks around the room. Looks at Rudy's 
               toys. Picks up some superhero comics and sits on Rudy's bed. 
               Then he spies Rudy's COMPOSITION BOOK, picks it up and starts 
               reading it.

                                     RUDY (O.C.)
                         What are you doing?

               Terry looks up. Rudy is half-sitting up in bed.

                                     TERRY
                         Oh -- Just readin' some of your 
                         compositions.

                                     RUDY
                         Why are you smoking?

                                     TERRY
                         Um... Because it's bad. Don't ever 
                         do it.

                                     RUDY
                         I won't.

                                     TERRY
                         You know this used to be my room?

                                     RUDY
                         Yeah...
                              (Pause)
                         Do you want it back?

                                     TERRY
                         No.

               Rudy is very relieved. Terry keeps reading. Rudy watches 
               him.

                                     RUDY
                         Did you fight in Vietnam?

                                     TERRY
                         No. I wasn't even born yet.

                                     RUDY
                         Were you ever in the army?

                                     TERRY
                         No.

                                     RUDY
                         My father was in the army.

                                     TERRY
                         I know. Unfortunately he didn't fight 
                         in Vietnam either.

                                     RUDY
                         Were you friends with him?

                                     TERRY
                         Not really. We had some friends in 
                         common, I guess... I didn't like him 
                         very much.

                                     RUDY
                         Why not?

                                     TERRY
                         Well, he wasn't very likable.

                                     RUDY
                         Why do you say that?

                                     TERRY
                         I don't know. He was always -- He 
                         always had to be better than you at 
                         everything. You know. Like if you 
                         were all playing basketball or 
                         something, everybody's havin' like a 
                         friendly game and he's like ready to 
                         kill somebody if his team didn't 
                         win. Or like if you told like a joke 
                         or a story, he always had to tell a 
                         better one? Kinda gets annoying after 
                         a while. Plus it was pretty scummy 
                         how he split on your mom and you... 
                         He was a prick. Probably still a 
                         prick. Fortunately for you though, 
                         your mom is like, the greatest. So 
                         you had some bad luck and you had 
                         some good luck.
                              (Pause)
                         You mind if I ask you a personal 
                         question?

                                     RUDY
                         I don't know.

                                     TERRY
                         Do you like it here? I mean, in 
                         Scottsville?

                                     RUDY
                         Yeah...?

                                     TERRY
                         Why?

                                     RUDY
                         I don't know. My friends are here... 
                         I like the scenery... I don't know.

                                     TERRY
                         I know, I know, but it's so... There's 
                         nothing to do here.

                                     RUDY
                         Yes there is.

                                     TERRY
                         No there isn't, man! It's narrow. 
                         It's dull. It's a dull, narrow town 
                         full of dull, narrow people who don't 
                         know anything except... what things 
                         are like right around here. They 
                         have no perspective whatsoever. No 
                         scope. They might as well be living 
                         in the nineteenth century because 
                         they have no idea what's going on, 
                         and if you try to tell 'em that, 
                         they wanna fuckin' kill you.

                                     RUDY
                         What are you talking about?

                                     TERRY
                         I don't know...

               Terry lies on his back and smokes.

                                     TERRY
                         You're a good kid.

               INT. BANK -- SAMMY'S DESK. MORNING

               There's a NOTE on Sammy's chair.

               "SAMMY, PLEASE SEE ME -- BRIAN"

               Sammy, just arrived at work and still in her coat, looks 
               down at the note.

               INT. BANK -- BRIAN'S OFFICE. DAY

               Sammy listens to Brian.

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah. This doesn't apply to you 
                         directly, Sammy, but I've noticed 
                         that some of the employees have their 
                         PC monitors set with all kinds of 
                         crazy colors... Purple and polka 
                         dots or what have you. And it's not 
                         a big deal, but really, this is a 
                         bank. You know? It's not really 
                         appropriate. So I'm just asking that 
                         people stick to a more quote unquote 
                         normal range of colors in future...

               Sammy looks at him blankly.

                                     BRIAN
                         Like I say, it doesn't really apply 
                         to you.

                                     SAMMY
                         No, my computer palette's pretty 
                         conservative.

               INT. BANK -- MABEL'S DESK. DAY

               Mabel is typing angrily at a GRAY SCREEN with BLACK LETTERS. 
               Sammy walks by. Mabel is so mad she doesn't even look up.

               INT. BANK -- SAMMY'S DESK. DAY

               Sammy sits agitated for a moment. She makes a decision, picks 
               up the phone and dials.

               INT. BOB'S OFFICE. SIMULTANEOUS

               Bob is in his little realty office with two CLIENTS, a husband 
               and wife. He picks up his RINGING PHONE.

                                     BOB
                              (Into phone)
                         Bob Steegerson.

                                     SAMMY
                              (On phone)
                         What are you wearing?

                                     BOB
                              (Into phone)
                         Mom?

               Sammy LAUGHS.

               INT. SAMMY'S HOUSE -- DOWNSTAIRS HALL. NIGHT

               Terry is holding a broom looking up at the ceiling. Sammy 
               passes by and stops.

                                     SAMMY
                         What's up?

               Terry taps the broom handle against the ceiling.

                                     TERRY
                         Do you know you have an enormous 
                         leak from the upstairs hall?

               He pokes again. A portion of the ceiling collapses on his 
               head in wet chunks of plaster and muck.

                                     SAMMY
                         Um, yeah, thanks, I did.

               INT. SAMMY'S ROOM. NIGHT

               Sammy, in front of the mirror, finishes dolling herself up 
               for her date. O.C. we hear loud banging. Sammy puts on her 
               earrings and goes into --

               INT. HALL. CONTINUOUS

                                     SAMMY
                         Are you guys sure you're gonna be 
                         OK?

                                     TERRY
                         Yes. Yes.

               Sammy approaches RUDY and TERRY. They are bent over a big 
               nasty trench in the floorboard. There are wood shavings and 
               greasy pipe segments all over, and black smeary smudges on 
               the walls nearby.

                                     SAMMY
                         What is happening here?

                                     TERRY
                         It's just -- The problem is that the 
                         pipe is corroded all the way along 
                         the length of the hall. So every 
                         time I put in a new piece it starts 
                         leaking further down.

                                     SAMMY
                         Why don't I just call the plumber?

                                     TERRY
                         Why? He's not gonna do anything 
                         different than what I'm doing.

                                     RUDY
                              (Happily)
                         Yeah. We're making it worse!

                                     TERRY
                         No we're not. Shut up.

               Terry yanks the wrench and a SPRAY of FILTHY WATER comes out 
               of the pipe and splatters the wallpaper and pictures and 
               Sammy with gritty gray water. She looks at them.

                                     SAMMY
                         Thank you. Thank you both.

               INT. HALLWAY. NIGHT

               Bob and Sammy -- cleaned up and wearing a different outfit -- 
               are bustling out the front door. Terry stands by.

                                     SAMMY
                         Now, call if there's any problem, 
                         and if I'm not there, I'm either on 
                         my way or on my way back home.

                                     TERRY
                         OK.

               Sammy gets into her coat. Bob opens the front door.

                                     SAMMY
                              (To TERRY)
                         So lights out at ten... and don't 
                         spend the whole night watching TV.

                                     TERRY
                         Nice to meet you, Bob.

                                     BOB
                         You too.

                                     TERRY
                              (To SAMMY)
                         What's your idea of the whole night?

                                     SAMMY
                         Two hours tops.

               Bob holds the door for Sammy and smiles at her. There is 
               some confusion about who should go out first. Finally she 
               goes and Bob follows. The atmosphere between them is fairly 
               awkward.

               INT. SAMMY'S HOUSE. NIGHT

               Terry and Rudy are watching TV from the sofa.

                                     TERRY
                         What's your feeling about Bob?

                                     RUDY
                         I don't really know him that well.

               Terry looks at his watch.

                                     TERRY
                         I have bad news for you.

               He picks up the remote...

                                     RUDY
                         No...!

               ...and turns off the TV. They sit there in the sudden silence.

                                     RUDY
                         Great. What are we supposed to do 
                         now?

                                     TERRY
                         Do you know how to play pool?

                                     RUDY
                         I've played it.

               EXT. THE WILD MOOSE. NIGHT

               The Wild Moose is a noisy roadside bar sitting under the 
               stars. Terry and Rudy get out of the car. Rudy looks 
               apprehensive.

                                     RUDY
                         I don't think they let kids in there.

                                     TERRY
                         Well, we're not allowed to watch any 
                         more TV, so it's this or nothing... 
                         But if we run into any trouble, let 
                         me do the talking.

                                     RUDY
                         OK.

               Terry swings the door open.

               INT. THE WILD MOOSE. NIGHT

               POV RUDY: A lot of men and women at the bar or in booths, 
               eating and drinking. Smoky, crowded and very loud. As he 
               follows Terry through the crowd various patrons notice him -- 
               some of the looks are friendly, some blank, some cold, i.e., 
               what's a kid doing in here?

               AT THE POOL TABLE: Terry and Rudy stand side by side facing 
               the players and waiting players gathered around the table. 
               Terry waves a few bills.

                                     TERRY
                         I got a hundred bucks here says me 
                         and my nephew can beat anybody in 
                         here. Only we gotta get the next 
                         game 'cause he's gotta be in bed by 
                         ten o'clock.

               A MOMENT LATER: RUDY, very nervous, and the 1st Pool Player 
               are side by side shooting for break. Terry is behind Rudy 
               coaching him.

                                     TERRY
                         Just hit it nice and soft... Nice 
                         and soft.

               They hit the balls. Rudy just clips his ball and it doesn't 
               go anywhere. 1st Pool Player's ball hits the opposite bank 
               and comes almost all the way back.

                                     RUDY
                              (To TERRY)
                         Sorry.

                                     TERRY
                         God damn, Rudy. I thought you said 
                         you could play.

               Rudy doesn't answer. Terry winks at him.

               A MOMENT LATER: 1ST POOL PLAYER BREAKS -- WHACK! -- The balls 
               scatter. Nothing drops. TERRY steps up to the table, chalking 
               up his cue.

                                     TERRY
                         Boys, it's all over but the cryin'.

               QUICK CUTS: Of Terry running the table and everyone watching. 
               Three-ball in the side. One-ball in the corner. Nine-ball 
               off three cushions and into the corner, and the eleven-ball 
               into the side. Rudy watches him.

               INT. BOB'S APARTMENT. NIGHT

               Bob and Sammy sit at Bob's dining room table. The little 
               bachelor apartment looks pretty good. Tablecloth, candles, 
               wine, everything. Bob has just dropped a huge bombshell.

                                     SAMMY
                         Bob... Are you serious?

                                     BOB
                         Yeah.

                                     SAMMY
                         I... I don't know what to say. I --

                                     BOB
                         I mean, I know I haven't exactly 
                         been the most... decisive... guy. In 
                         the past... I don't know: I'm tired 
                         of foolin' around. And I love you.

                                     SAMMY
                         I... I'm totally... I don't know 
                         what to say.

                                     BOB
                         Well, you could always say "Yes."
                              (Pause)
                         Or you could think about it first.

                                     SAMMY
                         That's it: I want to think about it.

                                     BOB
                         OK... Fair enough.

               INT. WILD MOOSE. NIGHT

               Terry has sunk everything but the eight ball. He leans over 
               to sink it. It's a fairly easy shot. He lines it up carefully, 
               and deliberately shoots it so it stops two inches from the 
               corner pocket.

                                     TERRY
                         Ohhhh!

               A FEW MOMENTS LATER: Terry and Rudy sit side by side watching 
               as the 2nd Pool Player passes back and forth between them 
               and the camera, running the table. "Oohs" and "All rights" 
               emit from the spectators.

               Sudden silence. Then the clack of the balls connecting. A 
               great common GROAN goes up. RUDY looks up at Terry.

                                     TERRY
                         It's all yours, baby.

               Rudy looks at the TABLE: The eight-ball is two inches off 
               the corner. The cue ball is a few inches away from it. A 
               piece of cake, for an adult. Rudy looks deeply unconfident.

               He gets up and tries to line up the eight-ball. Terry is 
               right next to him.

                                     TERRY
                         Just make sure to hit it really 
                         gentle. But firm. And hit it a little 
                         low so you get some backspin. Don't 
                         even hit it. Just kiss it.

               A long moment.

                                     RUDY
                         What do you mean, kiss it?

                                     TERRY
                         I mean tap it. Firm but very, very 
                         softly. And don't shoot until you 
                         know it's going in. OK?

                                     RUDY
                         OK.

               Everyone is relatively quiet. Rudy takes a few practice 
               strokes and then hits the cue ball, straight, but too softly. 
               It crawls toward the eight and taps it toward the corner, 
               slower and slower, hangs there, and DROPS.

               A GENERAL "HEYYY!" GOES UP and everyone claps and cheers. 
               Terry grabs Rudy. Rudy smiles, ecstatic.

                                     TERRY
                         That was great!

               AT THE BAR: Darryl the SHERIFF, in his civvies, drinking a 
               pint of beer, notices Rudy and Terry.

               AT THE POOL TABLE: Terry picks Rudy up and turns him upside 
               down. Rudy laughs.

               EXT. SAMMY'S HOUSE. NIGHT

               The house is dark. Terry and Rudy are walking from the car 
               to the house.

                                     RUDY
                         We creamed those guys! We creamed 
                         them!

                                     TERRY
                              (Stopping suddenly)
                         Ssh...! Don't move.

               They listen. A CAR is COMING.

                                     TERRY
                         It's them!

               They break for the door, Terry fumbling for his key. He gets 
               the door open.

                                     TERRY
                         Go! Go! Go!

               He and Rudy run inside the house. The lights go on. BOB'S 
               CAR pulls into the DRIVEWAY.

               INT. THE HOUSE -- FRONT DOOR. SIMULTANEOUS

               Rudy runs up the stairs.

                                     TERRY
                         Wait a minute, gimme your jacket!

               Rudy tries to take his jacket off fast but gets his arm caught 
               in the sleeve. He tries to shake it off.

                                     TERRY
                         What are you doing?

                                     RUDY
                         I can't get my sleeve out...!

               They HEAR Bob's CAR DOORS SLAM. Terry makes a comic panicked 
               face and leaps up the stairs two at a time.

               OUTSIDE THE HOUSE: Sammy waves to Bob. Bob waves back as he 
               drives off. Sammy goes to the front door, opens it:

               Terry and Rudy are in a giggly tangled panicked heap at the 
               top of the stairs, shaking Rudy's arm and sleeve, frantically 
               trying to get the jacket off.

               Sammy comes in. They freeze.

                                     SAMMY
                         What is going on in here?

                                     TERRY
                         Um -- We were just out doing some 
                         star-gazing, and, uh, Rudy lost track 
                         of the time. Which I totally warned 
                         him about.
                              (To Rudy)
                         You are a bad kid.

               INT. BATHROOM. LATER

               Rudy is brushing his teeth. Terry pokes his head in.

                                     TERRY
                              (In a low voice)
                         Hey: I think it's OK. Just don't 
                         tell her where we went, 'cause she'll 
                         be really mad at me. OK?

                                     RUDY
                         I won't.

                                     TERRY
                              (Suddenly dark)
                         Hey -- I'm not kidding, Rudy.

                                     RUDY
                         I won't!

               Terry gives him a "You better not" look, then leaves. Rudy 
               continues brushing his teeth.

               INT. RUDY'S ROOM. NIGHT

               Sammy is tucking Rudy in, stroking his hair.

                                     SAMMY
                         Did you know my Mommy used to take 
                         me and Uncle Terry out at night to 
                         look at the constellations?

                                     RUDY
                         Yeah.

                                     SAMMY
                         Did you see that one, what's the one -- 
                         It looks like a big "W"? Cassiopeia?

                                     RUDY
                         Yeah.

               INT. HALL. NIGHT

               Sammy comes out of Rudy's room, smiling. It's dark. She sees 
               a LIGHT on under TERRY'S DOOR. She walks toward it and steps 
               into the TRENCH, falling down violently.

                                     SAMMY
                         Ow! Shit!

               INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT

               Terry is putting a butterfly Band-Aid on Sammy's wound. It's 
               a nasty, bloody gash, just shy of needing stitches.

                                     SAMMY
                         I've got a great idea. Why don't you 
                         let me call the plumber?

                                     TERRY
                         Do whatever you want.

                                     SAMMY
                         Oh, does that make you mad?

                                     TERRY
                         No...

               INT. SAMMY'S ROOM. NIGHT

               RAIN patters on the ROOF as Sammy LIMPS back and forth across 
               the room changing into her nightgown.

               EXT. TERRY'S WINDOW. NIGHT

               Terry is smoking pot with his head and shoulders stuck outside 
               the window. RAIN FALLS on his HEAD.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. BANK. MORNING

               Early morning. The RAIN is still falling. Only a few cars 
               are in the employee parking lot yet.

               INT. BANK -- BRIAN'S OFFICE. DAY

               The RAIN runs down Brian's office window. BRIAN, in a wet 
               raincoat, turns on his light.

               A MOMENT LATER: Brian turns on his PC. The SCREEN lights up. 
               The COLORS are a garish GREEN and ORANGE.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               LATER: SAMMY and BRIAN are both on their feet. The door is 
               closed.

                                     SAMMY
                         Brian, get off my ass!

                                     BRIAN
                         Excuse me?

                                     SAMMY
                         I didn't change the colors on your 
                         stupid computer screen.

                                     BRIAN
                         Well, that's all you gotta say!

                                     SAMMY
                              (On "that's")
                         There is nothing wrong with the work 
                         I do here. I have been doing just 
                         fine, the whole time before you came 
                         here -- And if you think that riding 
                         people in this petty, ridiculous way 
                         is the way to improve service in 
                         this bank or anywhere else I think 
                         you're out of your mind!

               Pause.

                                     BRIAN
                         I didn't say there was. Could I please -- 
                         Could I please -- May I respond?

                                     SAMMY
                         No, that's really all I have to --

                                     BRIAN
                         May I respond?
                              (Beat)
                         First of all, I don't appreciate 
                         being spoken to with that kind of 
                         language. That's not the way I talk 
                         to you, and I'd appreciate it if you 
                         wouldn't talk that way to me --

                                     SAMMY
                         Well --

                                     BRIAN
                         Second of all, if you say you didn't 
                         change the colors on my computer 
                         screen, then of course I accept your 
                         answer. But you and I are gonna have 
                         to find a way to work together --

                                     SAMMY
                         Brian --

                                     BRIAN
                         But that's not gonna happen with the 
                         attitude, it's not gonna happen with 
                         the lateness, it's not gonna happen 
                         by fighting me every step of the way -- 
                         OK, well not you, you're not late, 
                         but too much of that stuff goes on 
                         around here --

                                     SAMMY
                         I am not late and I do not have an 
                         attitude -- Well then don't tell me 
                         I'm late if I'm not late!

                                     BRIAN
                         I'd really like to finish!

               OUTSIDE BRIAN'S OFFICE: The whole staff is listening to the 
               muffled raised VOICES from inside the office.

               MABEL especially is listening guiltily.

               EXT. MAIN STREET. DAY

               The rain falls on Main Street.

               EXT. ORRIN'S BACKYARD. DAY

               The rain comes down hard on Orrin's construction project. 
               Tarps cover everything. No work today.

               EXT. MAIN STREET -- LUNCH PLACE. DAY

               The rain comes down on the SHERIFF, looking through the 
               restaurant WINDOW at SAMMY, eating lunch alone at the counter. 
               He goes inside, shakes the rain off himself and goes over to 
               her. They start talking. We HEAR:

                                     SAMMY
                         They were where?

               INT. SAMMY'S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM. DAY

               The RAIN on the roof makes a sleepy, pleasant country sound.

               TERRY is lying on the sofa, smoking a joint, watching TV, in 
               a funk. O.C. we LOUD BANGING ON THE PIPES.

               LATER: A YOUNG PLUMBER, about Terry's age, comes thumping 
               down the stairs and goes into the living room, carrying his 
               toolbox. Terry looks up at him.

                                     PLUMBER
                         OK, you're all set.

               Terry glares at him. The plumber turns and goes out.

               EXT. BUS STOP. DAY

               RUDY is WAITING in a doorway for Terry. He is wet and cold. 
               The RAIN pours down.

               INT. BANK. DAY

               Brian is showing his wife, NANCY, the bank. He is very 
               solicitous of her, nervously introducing her to the employees, 
               who are not responding very warmly. Nancy is not in a warm 
               mood either; she's very testy with Brian.

                                     BRIAN
                         This is Chuck. Chuck, this is my 
                         wife, Nancy.

                                     CHUCK
                         Hello.

                                     NANCY
                         Nice to meet you.

                                     BRIAN
                         This is Mabel...

                                     MABEL
                         Hi.

                                     NANCY
                         Nice to meet you.

               SAMMY, at her desk, watches Brian and Nancy make their 
               progress through the bank. Nobody is being very friendly, 
               and Brian suddenly seems awkward and vulnerable. Brian and 
               Nancy reach Sammy's desk.

                                     BRIAN
                         This is Sammy, our lending officer. 
                         Sammy, this is my wife, Nancy.

                                     SAMMY
                              (Friendly)
                         Hi. It's nice to meet you.

                                     NANCY
                         Brian -- I gotta sit down.

                                     BRIAN
                         Sure -- Let's go in my office.

               He glances nervously at Sammy as he leads Nancy away from 
               her desk and toward his office. He murmurs something to Nancy, 
               who responds in a low but very testy voice:

                                     NANCY
                         I'm fine...!

               She roughly pulls her arm away from his. Sammy watches them 
               go into his office.

               EXT. MAIN STREET. DAY

               Rudy trudges resolutely through the pouring rain toward the 
               center of town. He is completely drenched.

               INT. BRIAN'S OFFICE. DAY

               Sammy knocks on Brian's open door.

                                     SAMMY
                         Brian...?

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah.

                                     RUDY (O.C.)
                         Mom!

               Sammy sees to her left, down the hallway --

                                     SAMMY
                         Rudy!

               Rudy is at the end of the hall, drenched and shivering, but 
               cheerful.

               EXT. EMPLOYEE PARKING LOT. DAY

               Rudy is in the car, somewhat dried off, waiting. Sammy and 
               Terry stand in the employee entrance doorway.

                                     SAMMY
                         Look, I'm glad you guys are getting 
                         along so well -- like, you have no 
                         idea -- but if I can't rely on you 
                         to remember to get him once a day...

                                     TERRY
                         You can!

                                     SAMMY
                         -- And what are you doing taking him 
                         to play pool in the middle of the 
                         night, and then telling him to lie 
                         to me about it?

               Pause.

                                     TERRY
                         I don't know.

               INT./EXT. SAMMY'S CAR/CAROL'S DRIVEWAY. DAY

               Terry and Rudy pull up in front of the driveway. Terry is in 
               a silent rage. The rain has let up.

                                     TERRY
                         Get out of the car.

                                     RUDY
                         What are we doing?

                                     TERRY
                         You're going to Carol's house and 
                         I'm going home.

                                     RUDY
                         Why can't I come with you?

                                     TERRY
                         Because if you're such a baby you 
                         gotta tell your Mommy about us playin' 
                         pool when I totally asked you not 
                         to, and I gotta listen to her shit 
                         all day, then you're goin' to the 
                         baby-sitter's so you can stay at the 
                         baby house.

                                     RUDY
                         But I didn't tell her!

                                     TERRY
                         You know what? Don't even fuckin' 
                         talk to me.

                                     RUDY
                         I didn't!

                                     TERRY
                         Just get out of the car.

               He leans over Rudy roughly and pushes open the door. Rudy 
               gets out of the car and marches down the long driveway. He 
               bursts into tears.

               Terry watches him go, then drives off.

               INT. BANK -- HALL. A FEW MOMENTS LATER

               Sammy walks through the empty bank hall and into Brian's 
               office. Brian is at his desk.

                                     BRIAN
                         You're working late.

                                     SAMMY
                         How did your wife like the bank?

                                     BRIAN
                         Oh, fine. She wasn't feeling so great.

                                     SAMMY
                         That's too bad.

                                     BRIAN
                         No -- I don't mean -- She's not ill. 
                         She's just... I don't know...

                                     SAMMY
                         Pregnant?

                                     BRIAN
                         That's it. She's pregnant.

                                     SAMMY
                         It can make you kind of cranky.

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah...

               Pause.

                                     BRIAN
                         Listen, I'm sorry we've been stepping 
                         on each other's toes -- I -- I'm not 
                         actually that bad a guy --

                                     SAMMY
                         Yeah, I am too... I know you're not, 
                         Brian, but you're driving everybody 
                         crazy.

                                     BRIAN
                         Well, I -- I'm just trying to do my 
                         best here -- And I'm gettin' it from 
                         all sides.

                                     SAMMY
                         I know you are...

                                     BRIAN
                         Anyway... We'll work it out...

                                     SAMMY
                         Well... I could use a beer.

                                     BRIAN
                         I could use a tranquilizer.

               INT. PUB. NIGHT

               Brian and Sammy sit at a table in the corner of the dimly 
               lit pub. It's a medium noisy place with various locals 
               drinking beers and eating hamburgers and chicken dinners.

                                     SAMMY
                         Last I heard, Rudy's Dad was living 
                         over in Auburn. But that was last 
                         year.

                                     BRIAN
                         Must be so tough raising a kid on 
                         your own... Although I'm beginning 
                         to get the idea my wife wouldn't 
                         mind a crack at it.

                                     SAMMY
                         Oh... It's just the hormones.

                                     BRIAN
                         Well, no, it isn't. But never mind.

               The waitress brings them two boilermakers.

               SAMMY and BRIAN Thanks.

               She leaves. Sammy and Brian pick up their shots.

                                     BRIAN
                         Well, here's to improved employee-
                         management relations.

                                     SAMMY
                         Amen.

               They click shot glasses and drink.

                                     SAMMY
                         You can't judge all of Scottsville 
                         by the people in that bank, believe 
                         me.

                                     BRIAN
                         Well -- Let's -- Let's not talk about 
                         the bank.

                                     SAMMY
                         OK.

                                     BRIAN
                         Let's just forget about the bank for 
                         tonight.

                                     SAMMY
                         Good idea.

               They sip their drinks, smiling. Sammy looks at him 
               appraisingly.

               INT./EXT. BRIAN'S CAR/WOODED ROAD. NIGHT

               Sammy and Brian are making out in the front seat of his car. 
               This goes on for a while, getting heavier and heavier.

                                     BRIAN
                         Sammy?

                                     SAMMY
                         Yeah?

                                     BRIAN
                         I want you to tell me who changed 
                         the colors on my computer screen.

                                     SAMMY
                         I'll never tell.

               They start kissing again in the cramped space. Brian bangs 
               his head. They laugh.

               EXT. OUTSIDE THE CAR. CONTINUOUS

               We pull back and away from the car. The sodden trees spout 
               faucets of water down on the car.

               INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT

               The kitchen is dark. Sammy comes in, her hair a little wet, 
               and turns on the light. She goes to the telephone.

               There's a NOTE in Terry's handwriting:

               "BOB CALLED."

                                     TERRY (O.C.)
                         Where were you?

               Sammy jumps, startled. Terry is in the kitchen doorway.

                                     SAMMY
                         Nowhere. I had dinner with my boss.

                                     TERRY
                         Kind of a late dinner, ain't it?

                                     SAMMY
                         Yeah. How was Rudy?

                                     TERRY
                         Fine.

                                     SAMMY
                         Did the plumber come?

                                     TERRY
                         Yes, the fucking plumber came.

                                     SAMMY
                         Terry -- Give me a break!!!

               Pause.

                                     TERRY
                         What's the matter with you?

                                     SAMMY
                         Nothing. I'm just tired.

                                     TERRY
                         You want to smoke some pot?

                                     SAMMY
                         No I don't. Why, you got some?

               EXT. PORCH. NIGHT

               Sammy and Terry stand side by side on the porch, passing a 
               joint back and forth. It has stopped raining but the trees 
               and roof are still dripping. The crickets are chirping loudly.

                                     SAMMY
                         So... Bob asked me to marry him.

                                     TERRY
                         Wow.
                              (Pause)
                         Are you going to?

                                     SAMMY
                         I don't know. If he'd've asked me 
                         this time last year I would have 
                         probably said yes. But the minute he 
                         said it, I don't know, I felt like 
                         somebody was trying to strangle me.

                                     TERRY
                         Well... bad sign.

                                     SAMMY
                         I know.
                              (Pause)
                         Plus, Terry...
                              (Whispers)
                         I fucked my boss...!

                                     TERRY
                         What?

                                     SAMMY
                         I know! And his wife is six months 
                         pregnant.

                                     TERRY
                         Jesus Christ, Sammy...!

                                     SAMMY
                         I know, I know.

               He passes her the joint. She declines. He puffs away. The 
               water drips off the porch and the crickets chirp. She puts 
               her head on his shoulder. He puts one arm around her and 
               puffs away with the joint in his free hand.

                                     SAMMY
                         Terry, I'm sorry I got so mad before. 
                         I just don't want him, you know -- 
                         terrified of "telling," if there's --

                                     TERRY
                         Uh, well, that's not really his 
                         problem, Sammy.

               Sammy straightens up.

                                     SAMMY
                         Oh really? What's his problem?

                                     TERRY
                         His problem is that he's like totally 
                         sheltered because you treat him like 
                         he's three, instead of eight, so 
                         that's how he behaves.

                                     SAMMY
                         Oh yeah? And how do you think he 
                         should behave?

                                     TERRY
                         I think he shouldn't have to run and 
                         tell his Mommy every time he does 
                         something she might not like, for 
                         one thing.

                                     SAMMY
                         Uh huh. And what do you --

                                     TERRY
                              (On "and")
                         I mean I took him to play pool! It 
                         was a little clandestine thing we 
                         did for fun! It wasn't like a big 
                         secret, I mean who cares? I was 
                         actually trying to be nice to him. 
                         But he's so freaked out that he 
                         disobeyed your orders that he has to 
                         fuckin' squeal on me and I have to 
                         listen to your fuckin' shit all day 
                         when I didn't even fuckin' do 
                         anything!

                                     SAMMY
                         First of all, he didn't tell me 
                         anything: Darryl did. OK? Second of 
                         all, I don't really give a shit if 
                         you took him to play pool: I was mad 
                         at you because you left him standing 
                         at the bus stop in the rain. But no, 
                         I don't want you telling him not to 
                         squeal, because I don't want him put 
                         in that position!

                                     TERRY
                              (Losing ground)
                         Well... that... is a perfect example 
                         of what I'm talking about.

                                     SAMMY
                         You are in idiot.

               They stand apart now. Silence.

                                     TERRY
                         Darryl told you?

                                     SAMMY
                         Yes!

               They stand there. The rain gutters drip.

               INT. BANK. MORNING

               Sammy, coat on, arrives at her desk and puts her purse down. 
               There's a NOTE on her CHAIR.

               "SAMMY -- PLEASE SEE ME."

               INT. BANK -- HALLWAY. A MOMENT LATER

               TRACKING SAMMY, coat off, carrying a stack of folders, as 
               she walks from her desk, around the corner, down the hall, 
               past a couple of employees and to BRIAN'S OPEN DOOR. She 
               taps on it. Brian is at his desk.

                                     SAMMY
                         Morning.

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah, good morning. Could you get 
                         the door?

               OUTSIDE THE OFFICE: Sammy shuts the door. MABEL and DORIS, 
               standing near the door, look at each other: i.e., Sammy's in 
               trouble again.

               INSIDE THE OFFICE: Sammy stands by the closed door. Brian 
               comes out around his desk.

                                     SAMMY
                         Listen -- I just --

               Brian kisses her. She drops her folders and they make out 
               against the door.

               OUTSIDE THE OFFICE: The employees click away at their PCs. 
               Mabel exchanges a quiet word with Chuck.

               INSIDE THE OFFICE: Brian has Sammy pressed against the wall 
               with her skirt hiked up and is trying to get both of their 
               underwear out of the way. It's not so easy in their office 
               clothes. Sammy tears away.

                                     SAMMY
                         Brian, that's enough.

               BRIAN falls back, breathless.

                                     BRIAN
                         OK. Sorry.

               He lunges at her again. They kiss some more.

               OUTSIDE THE OFFICE. A MOMENT LATER: Sammy comes out of the 
               office, more or less composed, carrying her folders. She 
               heads down the hall past the other employees, including Mabel, 
               and surreptitiously readjusts her scrunched-up underwear.

               INT. DAWSON'S. DAY

               Sammy and Bob sit at lunch. Sammy is picking at her food.

                                     BOB
                         You're awfully quiet.

                                     SAMMY
                         I'm sorry.

                                     BOB
                         Um... Have you thought at all about 
                         what I said?

                                     SAMMY
                         Of course I've been thinking about 
                         it.

                                     BOB
                         So... Any decisions? Or -- do you 
                         still want to think about it some 
                         more...?

                                     SAMMY
                         Well -- I mean -- I don't know, Bob. 
                         I mean, we haven't exactly been going 
                         steady the last few months, if you 
                         know what I mean --

                                     BOB
                         Yeah, no, I know --

                                     SAMMY
                         -- and then we see each other twice 
                         and you suddenly say you want to get 
                         married? I mean...

                                     BOB
                         No, you're right, you're right --

                                     SAMMY
                         What are you talking about?

               Pause.

                                     BOB
                         I don't know... I... Maybe this is... 
                         Last year I sort of thought you were 
                         possibly interested in that... idea... 
                         but I was the one who, you know, 
                         wasn't "ready" at that point -- So 
                         that's why I thought things kind of 
                         slowed down with us...

                                     SAMMY
                         Don't make me feel bad for you.

                                     BOB
                              (Bristling)
                         I don't want you to feel bad for me.

               INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT

               Sammy, Terry and Rudy are all watching TV. Sammy and Rudy 
               are in pajamas. Nobody's happy and nobody's talking.

               The PHONE RINGS. Sammy goes to it and picks up, surprised 
               because of the hour.

                                     SAMMY
                              (Into phone)
                         Hello?

                                     BRIAN
                              (On phone)
                         It's Brian.

               Sammy turns away and lowers her voice so Terry and Rudy won't 
               overhear her.

                                     SAMMY
                         Brian. Where are you?

               EXT. GAS STATION. SIMULTANEOUS

               Brian is on the pay phone outside a gas station.

                                     BRIAN
                         I'm buying milk. I just thought I'd 
                         say hello.

               WE CUT BETWEEN THEM. Sammy doesn't say anything.

                                     BRIAN
                         Look, I know it's probably too late, 
                         but is there any way you can come 
                         out for a little while?

                                     SAMMY
                         Brian, I think you're going crazy.

                                     BRIAN
                         I know I am. Can you meet me?

                                     SAMMY
                         Um, OK.

               INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT

               SAMMY comes down the stairs, fully dressed, into the living 
               room, where Terry and Rudy are still watching TV.

                                     SAMMY
                         Um -- I have to go out for a minute. 
                         Do you want anything?

                                     TERRY
                         Like what?

                                     SAMMY
                         I don't know.

                                     RUDY
                         Where are you going?

                                     TERRY
                         Yeah, where are you going?

                                     SAMMY
                         I just have to go out for a little 
                         while.

                                     RUDY
                         Where?

                                     TERRY
                         Yeah, where?

                                     SAMMY
                         I just have to go to Mabel's house.

                                     RUDY
                         Why?

                                     SAMMY
                         You know what, Rudy? It's personal. 
                         This is a personal matter that has 
                         to do with Mabel. I just have to go 
                         see her for a little while.

               Terry gives Sammy a look like, "You've got to be kidding." 
               Sammy tries to shush him with a conspiratorial look back. 
               She goes out.

               LATER. Terry and Rudy sit in front of the TV, alone.

                                     TERRY
                         Listen. Listen. I'm sorry I said you 
                         squealed on me. I was totally out of 
                         line, and I really owe you an apology.
                              (Pause)
                         Did you hear what I said?

                                     RUDY
                              (Staring at the TV)
                         I don't care.

               INT. SAMMY'S CAR (MOVING). NIGHT

               Sammy drives, listening to music. She shakes her head at 
               herself.

               EXT. MOTEL. NIGHT

               Sammy's car and Brian's car are parked side by side outside 
               a roadside motel.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM. NIGHT

               In the motel room, Sammy and Brian, half-clothed, make love 
               rather hurriedly on top of the unmade creaky bed.

               EXT. MOTEL. NIGHT

               Outside the motel, Sammy and Brian get into their respective 
               cars and start their motors.

               INT. SAMMY'S CAR (MOVING). NIGHT

               Sammy drives in the other direction. She breaks into a smile, 
               and then she laughs. Then she stops.

               INT. SAMMY'S BEDROOM. NIGHT

               Sammy lies awake plagued by guilty feelings.

               EXT. CHURCH -- RECTORY. DAY

               Sammy heads toward the little white church building.

               INT. CHURCH -- RECTORY -- OFFICE. DAY

               RON the MINISTER and Sammy drink coffee in silence.

                                     RON
                              (Gently)
                         What's on your mind, Sammy?

                                     SAMMY
                         Well, a lot. But principally... I 
                         was just wondering if you had an 
                         opinion. If you know someone, in 
                         your family, or just someone you 
                         really care about, and they just 
                         can't seem to get ahold of 
                         themselves...

               EXT. MAIN STREET. DAY

               The SUN SHINES on Main Street.

               INT. SPORTING GOODS STORE. DAY

               Rudy watches wide-eyed as Terry places on the sales counter 
               two rods and reels, a bunch of lures, two fishing hats, a 
               box of swivels, a knife and a fish scaler.

                                     TERRY
                         You know who this is for?

                                     RUDY
                         Me!

                                     TERRY
                         That's right, my little friend.
                              (To the saleslady)
                         Hello. We're going fishing.

               INT. SAMMY'S HOUSE -- KITCHEN. DAY

               Sammy, Terry and Rudy are all putting away the groceries. 
               Everybody seems to be getting along.

                                     RUDY
                         I got a new rod and reel, five lures, 
                         I got a hat, I got a knife and I got 
                         a fish scaler.

                                     SAMMY
                         That's great, honey.

               O.C., the DOORBELL RINGS. Sammy starts to move toward the 
               door, but Terry is closer.

                                     TERRY
                         I'll get it.

               Sammy watches him go.

               INT./EXT. FRONT DOOR. DAY

               Terry opens the door. It's Ron, the minister, in his civvies.

               EXT. FRONT YARD. DAY

               Rudy is playing basketball by himself.

               INT. SAMMY'S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM. DAY

               Terry, Sammy and RON sit in the living room. Sammy and Ron 
               are drinking coffee. Through the window we see occasional 
               glimpses of Rudy playing basketball in the backyard. There 
               is a heavy silence in the room.

                                     TERRY
                         Well... I'm not really sure why you're 
                         here, Ron. I mean, I realize I haven't 
                         exactly been a model citizen since I 
                         got here, but compared to how things 
                         have been goin' for me lately, I 
                         thought I was doing pretty well.

               He turns to Sammy.

                                     TERRY
                         And I also find it kind of 
                         discouraging that you seem to think 
                         I need some kind of spiritual 
                         counseling or what have you, so much 
                         so that you're willing to disregard 
                         the fact that I don't believe in any 
                         of this stuff at all --

                                     SAMMY
                         Well... I didn't mean to discourage 
                         you --

                                     TERRY
                         I mean it's really kind of insulting.

                                     RON
                         Can I say something here?
                              (Pause)
                         Sammy asked me to come and talk to 
                         you, because it's her opinion that 
                         you're not gonna find what you're 
                         looking for the way you're looking 
                         for it --

               MACHINE OFF the nightstand. Pause. She calms down and puts 
               them back. The ancient answering machine is CLICKING 
               convulsively. She WHACKS IT and it stops.

               The congregation is coming out of the church and milling 
               around at the steps. SAMMY, with Rudy at her side, is saying 
               good-bye to some neighbors. She watches pregnant NANCY and 
               BRIAN go down the steps.

               POV SAMMY: Beyond Brian and Nancy, TERRY pulls up at the 
               curb in her car. He rummages around and produces FISHING 
               RODS which he waves, somewhat sheepishly.

               REVERSE: At top speed, Rudy runs away from Sammy and the 
               church, toward Terry and the car. Terry and Sammy exchange a 
               look from the distance.

                         Well, it's a lot better than all 
                         this "Why do you think you're in 
                         this situation" psychological bullshit 
                         you hear all the time.

                                     RON
                         Well... Why do you think you're in 
                         this situation?

                                     SAMMY
                         With which one?

                                     RON
                         All of them.

               Pause.

                                     SAMMY
                         I feel sorry for them.
                              (Pause)
                         Isn't that ridiculous?

               Ron shrugs: i.e., "not necessarily."

               EXT. STREAM -- BRIDGE. DAY

               Terry and Rudy are side by side on a small footbridge over a 
               wide running stream, fishing. The sunlight slants through 
               the canopy of trees; the birds are chattering; it's gorgeous 
               and peaceful.

                                     RUDY
                         I've never been so bored in my life.

                                     TERRY
                         Yeah... We really shoulda been out 
                         here around seven or eight A.M.

                                     RUDY
                         What time is it now?

                                     TERRY
                         Two-thirty.

               Silence. The birds sing.

                                     RUDY
                         Was my father a good fisherman?

                                     TERRY
                         Yeah, your father was good at all 
                         that stuff. He knew everything about 
                         the woods, everything about fishing, 
                         everything about hunting and 
                         everything about cars. If he wasn't 
                         such a pain in the ass he would've 
                         been a lot of fun to be around.

                                     RUDY
                         Maybe he's nicer now.

                                     TERRY
                         I doubt it.

                                     RUDY
                         Well, I think he is.

                                     TERRY
                         How would you know? Did you ever 
                         meet him?

                                     RUDY
                         No.

                                     TERRY
                         Were you ever curious to meet him?

                                     RUDY
                         I guess so.

                                     TERRY
                         Well, he doesn't live very far from 
                         here.

                                     RUDY
                         I thought he lived in Alaska.

                                     TERRY
                         No -- I lived in Alaska. Your dad 
                         lives in Auburn. Far as I know.
                              (Pause)
                         We could look him up in the phone 
                         book. Wanna try?

                                     RUDY
                         All right.

                                     TERRY
                         OK -- But -- I'm sure I don't have 
                         to say this, but I'm not kidding, 
                         man: Don't -- tell -- your -- mother.

               INT. BOB'S APARTMENT. DAY

               BOB is standing by his kitchenette, extremely nervous. Sammy 
               sits on his sofa.

                                     BOB
                         Do you want to go for a walk, or a 
                         drive? It's really nice out.

                                     SAMMY
                         No. I'm not gonna stay long. Bob, I 
                         don't want to get married.

               Pause.

                                     BOB
                         OK.

                                     SAMMY
                         I've really thought about it a lot, 
                         and if you had asked me last year 
                         I'm sure I would have said yes.

                                     BOB
                         Oh. Thank you.

                                     SAMMY
                         But I'm not sure it would have been 
                         a good idea then either. I'm going 
                         through a really hard time right now 
                         and I just think that getting engaged 
                         to you or anyone would be just about 
                         the stupidest most self-destructive 
                         thing I could possibly do.

                                     BOB
                         OK.

                                     SAMMY
                         And I really think you have to grow 
                         up.

                                     BOB
                         Well, how about we fix up my 
                         personality some other time?

                                     SAMMY
                         OK.
                              (Pause)
                         I really hope we can still be friends.

                                     BOB
                              (Quietly sarcastic)
                         Oh, yes, me too.

               She looks at him miserably.

                                     SAMMY
                         Bob... This is so crazy... I mean... 
                         I don't even understand why you... I 
                         don't even get it.

                                     BOB
                         What do you want me to say? Everything 
                         you said about me was true, Sammy. I 
                         was just a big chickenshit jerk, and 
                         now I'm payin' the price.

                                     SAMMY
                         Bob...!

               She goes over to him. He gets up.

                                     BOB
                         What?

                                     SAMMY
                         Well -- I don't know...

                                     BOB
                         I don't know. Sammy, I love you. I 
                         wish I could say it in a more 
                         interesting way. I just -- I love 
                         you.

                                     SAMMY
                         Well -- I mean -- I love you too --

               He puts his arms around her and kisses her. She responds 
               very warmly. Just as things are heating up, she suddenly 
               remembers something and jolts away.

                                     SAMMY
                         Oh shit.

                                     BOB
                         What's the matter?

                                     SAMMY
                         I gotta go. I'm sorry --

                                     BOB
                         Where do you have to go?

                                     SAMMY
                              (Off the top of her 
                              head)
                         I'm supposed to -- I gotta get Mabel 
                         back her car.

                                     BOB
                         Well... I don't understand. How are 
                         we leaving things?

                                     SAMMY
                         Oh God, I don't know. Call me later.

               INT. MOTEL. DAY

               Brian sits on the edge of one of the beds watching some 
               daytime Sunday show on the motel TV. There is a knock at the 
               door. He gets up, turns off the TV and opens the door. It's 
               Sammy.

                                     SAMMY
                         Sorry I'm so late.

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah, I was just about to give up on 
                         you.

                                     SAMMY
                         Well -- maybe it would've been better 
                         if you had...

               She comes into the room and starts walking around briskly 
               and nervously.

                                     SAMMY
                         I mean -- Look, I don't mean to be 
                         unsympathetic about your domestic 
                         situation, whatever it is, but I'm 
                         just beginning to think that if people 
                         tried a little harder to stick to 
                         their commitments and started taking 
                         a little responsibility for their 
                         actions, they might end up having a 
                         lot less trouble generally. That's 
                         all.

                                     BRIAN
                         Hey, that's what I've been trying to 
                         tell you guys at the bank.

                                     SAMMY
                         Well, I really don't think I can do 
                         this anymore.

                                     BRIAN
                         OK.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM. LATER

               Brian and Sammy lie under the starchy sheets. Brian's eyes 
               are shut. Sammy is very upset with herself.

                                     SAMMY
                         This is incredible.

                                     BRIAN
                         Mmmm.

                                     SAMMY
                         That is not what I mean.

               INT. SAMMY'S CAR (MOVING). DAY

               Terry and Rudy drive along. Terry looks down at Rudy and 
               smiles. Rudy is tense and won't look at him.

               OVER TERRY AND RUDY'S SHOULDERS as Terry drives slowly past 
               dilapidated little houses in a very depressed residential 
               area. Terry is scanning the house numbers.

                                     RUDY
                         Maybe we should call first.

                                     TERRY
                         Well -- We're right here.

               He pulls up outside a small, plain, run-down ranch-style 
               house with a lot of junk out front, and gets out of the car. 
               Rudy stays in.

                                     TERRY
                         Come on.

               Rudy gets out of the car and comes around. Terry waits for 
               him, and then they walk up to the front door. The buzzer 
               says "KOLINSKI."

                                     TERRY
                         There he is.

                                     RUDY
                         His last name is Kolinski?

                                     TERRY
                         Yeah. Ring the bell.

               Rudy pushes the doorbell. They wait. There's some noise inside 
               and some voices. The sound of WALKING.

               THE DOOR OPENS. JANIE, a tired-looking young woman around 
               Terry's age, opens the door.

                                     JANIE
                         Yes?

                                     TERRY
                         Hi. We're looking for Rudy?

                                     JANIE
                         Who should I say is calling?

                         An old friend.

                                     RUDY SR. (O.C.)
                         Who is it?

                                     JANIE
                         He says an old friend!

                                     RUDY SR. (O.C.)
                         How old is he?

               RUDY SR. appears behind Janie. He's around thirty, wiry, 
               dressed in jeans and an old shirt. He doesn't look good. He 
               recognizes Terry.

                                     RUDY SR.
                         Hey!

                                     TERRY
                         Hey, Rudy.

               Rudy Sr. sees Rudy, who is looking up at him. His face falls.

                                     RUDY SR.
                         Hey.

               Rudy doesn't answer.

                                     TERRY
                              (To JANIE)
                         Hi, I'm Terry.

                                     JANIE
                         Hello.

                                     TERRY
                         And this is Rudy.

                                     JANIE
                         You don't say.

                                     TERRY
                         Rudy, meet Rudy.

               Rudy Sr. looks away, shaking his head. JANIE moves away from 
               the door.

                                     JANIE
                         I'll just be in the kitchen.

                                     TERRY
                         Nice to meet you.

               Janie goes into the kitchen. Rudy Sr. watches her go.

                                     TERRY
                         OK if we come in for a minute?

                                     RUDY SR.
                         What the hell are you doin'?

                                     TERRY
                         What do you mean what am I doin' --

               Rudy Sr. starts walking toward Terry to make him go back out 
               the door.

                                     RUDY SR.
                         Could you step away from the door 
                         please?

                                     TERRY
                         Well we just wanna --

                                     RUDY SR.
                         Could you step away from the door 
                         please?

                                     TERRY
                         All right, all right.

               They all go outside. Rudy Sr. pulls the door closed behind 
               him.

                                     RUDY SR.
                         What are you doin' here?

                                     TERRY
                         I just wanted the kid to see you --

                                     RUDY SR.
                         Well, now he saw me.
                              (He looks at Rudy)
                         Now you saw me. OK?
                              (To Terry)
                         Now would you mind?

                                     TERRY
                         Man, you are really --

                                     RUDY SR.
                         Look: I'm tryin' to be polite. So 
                         would you just take off? It's OK: 
                         Just take off.

                                     TERRY
                         I just wanna --

                                     RUDY SR.
                         Do you know what you're doin'? Just 
                         get outta here!

                                     TERRY
                         You know what, man? You're still a 
                         fuckin' asshole.

                                     RUDY SR.
                         I'm an asshole? Get outta here!

               Rudy Sr. shoves Terry. Terry belts him, and suddenly they 
               are throwing wild punches at each other. Rudy goes sprawling 
               in the dirt.

               Terry knocks Rudy Sr. down and starts pummeling him brutally. 
               Janie comes out of the house and jumps on his back, trying 
               to pull him off.

                                     JANIE
                         Get your fuckin' hands off him...!

               Terry throws Janie off him, grabs Rudy Sr. again and resumes 
               beating him up. Janie jumps back on top of him.

               Two neighbors run toward the melee to break it up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A FEW MOMENTS LATER: The cops have arrived. The 1ST COP is 
               talking to Rudy and Janie. The 2ND COP is talking to Terry. 
               Rudy Sr.'s face looks puffy and beaten up. A 3RD COP stands 
               apart with Rudy, who is watching the whole thing. WE CUT 
               rapidly and jerkily through this section:

                                     1ST COP
                         And you're not the boy's legal 
                         guardian?

                                     RUDY SR.
                         I don't even know if that's my kid!

                                     JANIE
                         They just showed up! We never seen 
                         them before...

                                     RUDY SR.
                         I used to know his sister --

                                     TERRY
                         I just came down here to talk to the 
                         guy and all of a sudden he starts 
                         shovin' me!

                                     2ND COP
                         Listen up. Listen up. You're gonna 
                         have to step back and just calm down --

                                     TERRY
                              (To RUDY SR.)
                         You're a lyin' fuckin' piece of shit.

                                     2ND COP
                              (To TERRY)
                         You're gonna have to step back.

                                     JANIE
                         We have a right to protect ourselves. 
                         What else do you need to know?

               A MOMENT LATER: The 2ND COP puts handcuffs on Terry. Rudy 
               watches.

                                     2ND COP
                         Now give me your right hand...

                                     TERRY
                         This is such bullshit. He started 
                         the whole thing and you're arresting 
                         me?

                                     2ND COP
                         Listen up. Now -- Listen up! Stop 
                         talkin'. Terry, stop talkin'.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A MOMENT LATER: As the 3RD COP walks Rudy to one cop car, 
               Rudy watches the 2ND COP guide the HANDCUFFED TERRY into the 
               other car.

               Rudy gets in the back of the car and looks out at RUDY SR. 
               and JANIE talking to the 1ST COP. Rudy Sr. is looking at him 
               over the 1st cop's shoulder.

                                     2ND COP
                         -- idea where we might be able to 
                         contact his mother?

                                     RUDY SR.
                         No, because he's not my Goddamn kid.

               The cop cars' doors slam first on Terry and then on Rudy.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM. NIGHT

               The room is dark. Sammy and Brian are asleep, half under the 
               covers. SAMMY WAKES with a START.

                                     SAMMY
                         What time is it?

                                     BRIAN
                              (Startled awake)
                         What's the matter?

               Sammy looks at the clock radio. 9:20.

                                     SAMMY
                         Oh my gosh.

               A FEW MOMENTS LATER: Sammy and Brian are on opposite sides 
               of the bed, getting dressed.

                                     BRIAN
                         Hey, you know, Nancy's gonna be gone 
                         for the rest of the week...

                                     SAMMY
                         You know... Brian...

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah?

                                     SAMMY
                         Well, I don't want to... I mean, 
                         couldn't we just... I mean, could we 
                         give it a rest?

               Pause.

                                     BRIAN
                         Um -- Yeah. Sure. If you want to.

                                     SAMMY
                         I mean... I just think... I don't 
                         know: We had a great little fling. 
                         You know? Let's not push it.
                              (Pause)
                         I mean, is that OK? I just --

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah. Sure. OK. You're right.

               Pause.

                                     SAMMY
                         So are we still friends?

                                     BRIAN
                              (Nods tersely)
                         Mm hm. Sure.

                                     SAMMY
                         All right. Good...!

               EXT. SAMMY'S HOUSE. NIGHT

               The crickets are chattering. The phone is ringing inside the 
               house.

               INT. SAMMY'S BEDROOM. SIMULTANEOUS

               The PHONE is ringing on the NIGHTSTAND. The battered answering 
               machine CLICKS convulsively but does not pick up.

               INT. SAMMY'S KITCHEN. NIGHT

               Sammy is on the phone in her bathrobe.

                                     SAMMY
                         Around two o'clock this afternoon... 
                         Yeah, a ninety three Toyota Tercel. 
                         New York plates V127AC... Please.

               INT. SAMMY'S HOUSE -- FRONT DOOR. NIGHT

               Sammy, dressed now, opens the door for BOB. She is very 
               anxious.

                                     SAMMY
                         Thanks for coming over. I just want 
                         to have a car handy just in case.

                                     BOB
                         No problem.

               INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT

               Sammy is on the phone. Bob sits at the table.

                                     SAMMY
                              (Into the phone)
                         Well -- what about other towns?... 
                         Yes! Yes! I called the highway patrol 
                         four times... Well what am I supposed 
                         to do all night?

               INT. SAMMY'S LIVING ROOM. LATER

               Sammy and Bob sit silently in the living room, waiting. She 
               is smoking. The CLOCK READS 12:40. Sammy is going crazy with 
               anxiety.

               EXT. SAMMY'S HOUSE. MORNING

               The PHONE rings inside the house as the early morning sun 
               slants through the trees around the house.

               INT. LIVING ROOM. SIMULTANEOUS

               The RINGING PHONE wakes BOB, on the sofa in his clothes --

               INT. SAMMY'S BEDROOM. SIMULTANEOUS

               -- and Sammy, half asleep on top of her bed, also in her 
               clothes. She GRABS the PHONE.

                                     SAMMY
                              (Into phone)

               INT. BOB'S CAR (MOVING). DAY

               Bob drives Sammy along the highway. She stares out the window. 
               She turns and watches Bob drive for a long moment.

               INT. BANK. DAY

               Brian walks through the morning bank activity and stops at 
               Mabel's desk.

                                     BRIAN
                         Anyone hear from Sammy this morning?

                                     MABEL
                         I didn't.

                                     BRIAN
                         Uh huh. Well, if anyone ever hears 
                         from her ever again, will you let me 
                         know?

                                     MABEL
                         Yes.

               EXT. AUBURN POLICE STATION. DAY

               On the steps of the police station, Sammy, Rudy and Bob wait 
               as Sheriff Darryl shakes hands with the Auburn Sheriff. The 
               Auburn Sheriff goes inside. Darryl comes over to Sammy.

                                     SHERIFF
                         It's gonna be all right... We got on 
                         the phone and talked to Rudy Sr. a 
                         little bit and he's calmed down, 
                         just wants to forget about the whole 
                         thing...

                                     SAMMY
                         Darryl, I really appreciate this...

               The Sheriff nods, but he's not thrilled to be here.

               INT. SAMMY'S LIVING ROOM. DUSK

               The PHONE IS RINGING. Sammy comes in the front door, Terry 
               and Rudy behind her. She snaps on the lights, hurries to the 
               phone and picks up.

               Behind her, Rudy goes upstairs and Terry plunks down on the 
               sofa and turns on the TV.

                                     SAMMY
                         Hello?

               INTERCUT WITH BRIAN, AT THE BANK.

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah, it's Brian.

                                     SAMMY
                         Brian --

                                     BRIAN
                         What the hell happened to you today, 
                         lady?

               SAMMY is about to answer, but she just HANGS UP instead.

               BRIAN is stunned into sheer gaping fury. Feverishly he hangs 
               up and dials again. It RINGS.

               Sammy picks up.

                                     SAMMY
                         Hello?

                                     BRIAN
                         You're fired!

                                     SAMMY
                         GOOD!

               She hangs up again.

               INT. RUDY'S ROOM. NIGHT

               Sammy is tucking Rudy into bed.

                                     SAMMY
                         Rudy?

                                     RUDY
                         Yeah?

                                     SAMMY
                         Is there anything you want to ask 
                         me, about your father?

                                     RUDY
                         Oh, that wasn't my father.

                                     SAMMY
                         What?

                                     RUDY
                         That wasn't him. I heard him tell 
                         the cops.

                                     SAMMY
                         No -- Rudy -- that was him. But that 
                         was him. I wish it wasn't, but it 
                         was.

                                     RUDY
                              (Very quiet)
                         No it wasn't.

                                     SAMMY
                         Rudy. Yes it was. Your father's name 
                         is Rudy Kolinski. He lives in 
                         Auburn...

               INT. HALLWAY. NIGHT

               Sammy comes out of Rudy's room, shutting the door softly. We 
               HEAR the TV going downstairs. She stands at the top of the 
               stairs for a moment.

               INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT

               Terry is watching TV on the sofa with his feet up on the 
               coffee table. Sammy comes down the stairs and into the living 
               room. He keeps watching TV. She doesn't sit. She is trembling.

                                     SAMMY
                         Could you turn that off for a minute 
                         please?

               He turns off the TV.

                                     TERRY
                         You don't have to say anything, Sammy.

                                     SAMMY
                         I want you to leave.

               Terry looks at her.

                                     TERRY
                         What do you mean?

                                     SAMMY
                         I mean I don't think you should live 
                         here anymore. I don't think you know 
                         how to behave around an eight-year-
                         old and I don't know how to make you 
                         stop, so I think you shouldn't live 
                         here. I don't know what else to say.

                                     TERRY
                         I don't know how to behave around an 
                         eight-year-old?

                                     SAMMY
                         That's right --

                                     TERRY
                         I think you don't know how to behave 
                         around an eight-year-old.

                                     SAMMY
                         Are you out of your MIND!?!

               Silence.

                                     SAMMY
                         Now you just listen to me. I may not 
                         be the greatest mother in the world, 
                         but I'm doing the best I know how. 
                         And he doesn't need you to rub his 
                         face in shit because you think it's 
                         good for him. He's going to find out 
                         the world is a horrible place and 
                         that people suck soon enough, and 
                         without any help from you. Believe 
                         me!

               Sammy tries to get ahold of herself. Her voice is shaking.

                                     SAMMY
                         I think you should get your own place. 
                         I thought, if you want, you could -- 
                         I'll be glad to help you out 
                         financially --

                                     TERRY
                         What do you mean, Get my own place?

                                     SAMMY
                         I mean I --

                                     TERRY
                         You mean in Scottsville?

                                     SAMMY
                         Yes.

                                     TERRY
                         Why would I do that? Why don't I 
                         just leave, period?

                                     SAMMY
                              (Quietly)
                         Well... If that's what you want to 
                         do, that's fine. But that's not what 
                         I'm saying. You are a very important 
                         person to Rudy, and you are the most 
                         important person to me. But I'm saying 
                         that I can't take any more of this --

                                     TERRY
                         Well --

                                     SAMMY
                         -- I thought -- maybe you could sell 
                         your half of the house to me, and I 
                         could pay you whatever it is over a 
                         certain amount of time, and that way --

                                     TERRY
                         No, you know what? I'll just go.

               He turns the TV back on.

                                     SAMMY
                              (Very quietly)
                         Well -- that's not what I'm saying.

               Terry shrugs and watches TV.

               INT. TERRY'S ROOM. NIGHT

               Terry is packing his bag. Rudy is watching.

                                     RUDY
                         Where are you going?

                                     TERRY
                         I don't know. I just want to get out 
                         of this town. And if you've got any 
                         sense when you get old enough you'll 
                         get out of here too. Your Mom's gonna 
                         live in this town for the rest of 
                         her life, and you know why? Because 
                         she thinks she has to. Don't ask me 
                         why, but that's the truth. She thinks 
                         there's all these things she has to 
                         do, but you want to know one thing 
                         about your Mom? She's a bigger fuck-
                         up than I ever was. I mean, I know I 
                         messed up. You think I enjoy getting 
                         thrown in jail because I wanted you 
                         to face that prick your Dad like a 
                         little man and see what kind of a 
                         guy he is? I know I got a little 
                         carried away, and I lost my temper 
                         just a little bit -- which is not 
                         the end of the world either, by the 
                         way, just for future reference --And 
                         now she's kickin' me out of my own 
                         house because -- you know, because I 
                         fucked up a little bit. Which I 
                         totally admit. I was like -- totally 
                         ready to admit that.

               He is finished stuffing his clothes into his backpack.

                                     RUDY
                         I could go with you.

                                     TERRY
                         Well, thanks, man. But I, uh, I can't 
                         really take care of you.

               INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT

               Sammy is flipping channels on the TV. The DOORBELL RINGS. 
               She is surprised. She gets up. Terry comes thundering down 
               the stairs, carrying his backpack.

                                     SAMMY
                         Is that for you?

                                     TERRY
                         Yeah, I'm just gonna stay at Ray's 
                         till I take off.

                                     SAMMY
                         You don't have to do that.

                                     TERRY
                         Yeah. Well, that's what I wanna do, 
                         so --

                                     SAMMY
                         Well but -- Are you gonna come back 
                         to say good-bye?

                                     TERRY
                         No -- I'm just gonna take off. I'll 
                         see you later.

                                     SAMMY
                         Well --

               Terry opens the door. RAY is there. Terry closes the door 
               behind him. Sammy listens to the PICKUP TRUCK DRIVE OFF. The 
               sound FADES.

               INT. RAY'S HOUSE. NIGHT

               Terry is bunked down on Ray's horrible sofa. In the b.g., 
               there is a light on in the bedroom. Terry fluffs his pillow 
               and shuts his eyes.

               EXT. SAMMY'S HOUSE. DAY

               Dressed for work and school, Sammy and Rudy walk to the car.

                                     SAMMY
                         Look. I know you're upset about Uncle 
                         Terry leaving, and so am I. But he's 
                         just not in control of himself, and 
                         I don't want him hurting your feelings 
                         anymore -- or mine. And you may not 
                         like it, but that's how it's gotta 
                         be. OK?

                                     RUDY
                         I don't care.

                                     SAMMY
                         You don't care. I don't care either.

               INT. BRIAN'S OFFICE. DAY

               Sammy sits in front of Brian's desk.

                                     BRIAN
                         Well... I'm sorry you're havin' all 
                         this trouble...

                                     SAMMY
                         Thank you.

                                     BRIAN
                         But you made a pretty good speech to 
                         me yesterday about people sticking 
                         to their commitments...

                                     SAMMY
                         Yeah...?

                                     BRIAN
                         Well... you made a commitment to 
                         this bank, Sammy. To this job.

                                     SAMMY
                         I know I'd --

                                     BRIAN
                         And to working things out with this 
                         tough new son of a bitch boss of 
                         yours. And whatever might have passed 
                         between us after hours doesn't mean 
                         you just walk away from that 
                         commitment -- yeah, even when you 
                         have a legitimate family emergency.

                                     SAMMY
                         I'm really sorry I didn't --

                                     BRIAN
                         Which is why I think in the calm 
                         cold light of day, we should both 
                         think real hard about whether or not 
                         you really want to continue on here 
                         at Merchants National Trust.

                                     SAMMY
                         You're not serious.

                                     BRIAN
                         ...you're not happy, I'm not happy, 
                         it's not good for you and it sure as 
                         heck isn't good for the bank.

               Pause.

                                     SAMMY
                         You know you're the worst manager 
                         we've ever had?

                                     BRIAN
                         Come on, Sammy...

                                     SAMMY
                         By far the worst.

                                     BRIAN
                         ...I don't wanna trade insults with 
                         you.

                                     SAMMY
                         Well, I don't want to be fired, Brian. 
                         I've been working here for seven 
                         years.

                                     BRIAN
                         Well --

                                     SAMMY
                         And if I were you I'd be a little 
                         nervous about firing an employee I 
                         just had an affair with. OK?

                                     BRIAN
                         That's -- Don't threaten me, Sammy: 
                         I'm not threatening you. I -- It's 
                         just an area I think we should 
                         explore.

                                     SAMMY
                         I'm not thr -- You explore it. I'm 
                         going back to work.

               She heads for the door, stops.

                                     SAMMY
                         Oh, and I have to pick up Rudy today 
                         because there's no one else to do 
                         it. But I'll find someone as soon as 
                         I have time.

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah. Fine. Why don't you just take 
                         over the whole bank?

               Sammy hesitates in the doorway. This thought has never 
               occurred to her before. She goes out.

               INT. LUNCH PLACE. DAY

               THROUGH THE WINDOW we see Sammy and Bob having lunch. Sammy 
               watches him eat, full of mixed feelings about him.

               INT. KITCHEN. DAY

               Sammy is at the stove, making pancakes. She puts a last 
               pancake onto Rudy's plate and brings it to him.

                                     SAMMY
                         Well, I called where Uncle Terry 
                         said he was gonna stay, and there 
                         was no answer, so I don't know if 
                         he's still in town or not.

               Rudy doesn't answer.

                                     SAMMY
                         Rudy? Are you not speaking to me?

               Rudy doesn't answer.

                                     SAMMY
                         Well, I'm sorry you're so mad at me, 
                         but I only did what I thought I had 
                         to do, and I hope you don't stay mad 
                         at me for the rest of your life.

               He opens the maple syrup and pours it on the pancakes.

                                     SAMMY
                         Rudy, that's too much.

               He keeps pouring. She grabs the bottle from him and upsets 
               some of the dishes on the table.

                                     SAMMY
                         You gotta cut this out!

                                     RUDY
                         What did I do?

                                     SAMMY
                         You don't know what you're talking 
                         about! There was nothing else I could 
                         do! I can't explain it better than 
                         that, but you can't go on like this 
                         because you don't know anything about 
                         it and you don't know what you're 
                         doing!

                                     RUDY
                              (Frightened)
                         OK, I'm sorry!

                                     SAMMY
                         I don't want you to be sorry, I just 
                         want you to STOP IT!

                                     RUDY
                         I will! I will! I'm stopping, I'm 
                         sorry.

               He comes around the table to her.

                                     RUDY
                         See? I'm stopping! I'm not doing it. 
                         See? I'm not.

               He's very alarmed. Sammy looks at him for a long moment.

               EXT. CEMETERY. DAY

               Terry walks through the little cemetery gate and makes his 
               way up the hill through the tombstones. He reaches his 
               parents' graves. He looks at the tombstones for a moment. He 
               puts his hand on top of one headstone, then the other.

               He sits down and smokes. He looks up at the SKY. It's a 
               beautiful deep blue sky dotted with billowy white clouds.

               He looks out over the hilly scenery. After a moment he shakes 
               his head a few times. He doesn't even know he's doing it. He 
               sits there.

               INT. RAY'S HOUSE. DAY

               The PHONE IS RINGING as Terry walks into the house. He walks 
               past it, to the fridge, gets a beer and opens it. It KEEPS 
               RINGING. He picks it up.

                                     TERRY
                              (Into phone)
                         Ray's house.

               INT. BANK -- SAMMY'S DESK. DAY

               Sammy is at her desk on the phone.

                                     SAMMY
                         Hi.

               WE CUT BETWEEN THEM. Terry doesn't say anything.

                                     SAMMY
                         I didn't know if you left yet.

                                     TERRY
                         No -- I'm leavin' tomorrow.

                                     SAMMY
                         Well -- What time?

                                     TERRY
                         There's a bus at nine.

                                     SAMMY
                         Well -- Can I -- I'd like to see you 
                         before you go. I mean, can I give 
                         you a lift? Or do you want to have 
                         breakfast or anything? And I think 
                         Rudy would really like to say good-
                         bye.

                                     TERRY
                         Yeah -- I don't know... I mean --

                                     SAMMY
                         Terry, you can't just leave like 
                         this. I --

                                     TERRY
                         All right, all right. I'll come by 
                         in the morning.

                                     SAMMY
                         All right -- But just -- We have to 
                         be out of the house by eight, so -- 
                         I don't want to tell Rudy you're 
                         coming unless you really think you 
                         can make it --

                                     TERRY
                         Yeah -- No -- I'll be there.

                                     SAMMY
                         All right.

                                     TERRY
                         All right.

               INT. KITCHEN. MORNING

               Sammy is clearing the breakfast dishes. Rudy is finishing up 
               his cereal. The clock reads 7:50.

                                     SAMMY
                         You should get your sneakers on.

               EXT. HOUSE. A MOMENT LATER

               Sammy comes out and looks up and down the road.

               INT. LIVING ROOM. A FEW MOMENTS LATER

               Rudy sits in the living room in his baseball jacket. His 
               knapsack is on the floor beside him. He looks at the CLOCK: 
               8:06. Sammy comes into the living room and looks at him.

                                     SAMMY
                         Sweetie, I'm sorry, we have to go.

                                     RUDY
                         Why can't I miss school one day?

               They HEAR the PICKUP PULL UP OUTSIDE, O.C. Rudy gets up 
               immediately.

               EXT. THE HOUSE. A MOMENT LATER

               Terry jumps out of RAY'S PICKUP. Sammy opens the front door 
               and Rudy runs out toward Terry.

                                     RUDY
                         Hi!

                                     TERRY
                         Hey, how's it goin', man?

               Rudy stops short in front of Terry. Terry looks at Sammy, in 
               the doorway.

                                     TERRY
                         Sorry I'm late.

               EXT./INT. CAR. DAY

               The car stops across the street from the BUS. The LAST KIDS 
               are getting in. SAMMY HONKS for the bus driver, and Sammy, 
               Terry and Rudy all get out.

                                     TERRY
                         So Rudy... If I write you a letter, 
                         will you write me back?

                                     RUDY
                         Yeah.

                                     TERRY
                         OK, well, that's gonna be pretty 
                         nice for you, because I write a pretty 
                         Goddamn interesting letter.

                                     RUDY
                         Yeah, we'll see.

                                     TERRY
                         All right. Well, say good-bye.

                                     RUDY
                         Bye.

               Rudy hugs Terry. Terry hugs him back. He is suddenly overcome 
               and presses his lips to the top of Rudy's head.

               Rudy walks to the BUS and gets on. The bus pulls away.

               Alone now, Sammy and Terry are not that comfortable. He moves 
               to get back in the car, and she does the same.

               EXT. BENCH. DAY

               Sammy and Terry sit on a bench near the bus stop. Terry's 
               backpack is by his side.

                                     SAMMY
                         Do you need some cash for the bus?

                                     TERRY
                         No, I got a few bucks... Aren't you 
                         gonna be late for work?

                                     SAMMY
                         Oh -- Yeah. That's OK.
                              (Pause)
                         Terry, I don't even know where you're 
                         going.

                                     TERRY
                         Oh, well, I didn't really have a 
                         concrete plan yet. I have to go back 
                         to Worcester and get my stuff...

                                     SAMMY
                         Oh, are you gonna try to see that 
                         girl?

                                     TERRY
                         Well... Yeah... You know... Thought 
                         maybe I'd try to show my face... Let 
                         her brother have a crack at me...

                                     SAMMY
                         What?

                                     TERRY
                         No...

                                     SAMMY
                         ...I don't want anyone to have a 
                         crack at you.

                                     TERRY
                         I'm just kidding. I just thought... 
                         Just thought I'd check up on her...
                              (Pause)
                         Anyway, after that, I don't really 
                         know. I've been thinking about Alaska 
                         a lot. I still got some friends out 
                         there. I don't really know. Anyway, 
                         I'll write you.

                                     SAMMY
                         You will?

                                     TERRY
                         Sure, Sammy. Of course I will. You 
                         know that.

               Pause.

                                     SAMMY
                         What is gonna happen to you?

                                     TERRY
                         Nothing too bad... But I gotta tell 
                         you, I know things didn't work out 
                         too well this time...

                                     SAMMY
                         Well, Terry --

                                     TERRY
                         ...but it's always really good to 
                         know that wherever I am, whatever 
                         stupid shit I'm doing, you're back 
                         at my home, rooting for me.

                                     SAMMY
                         I do root for you.

               She starts crying, and looks down.

                                     TERRY
                         Come on, Sammy. Everything's gonna 
                         be all right... Comparatively... And 
                         I'll be back this way...

                                     SAMMY
                         I feel like I'm never gonna see you 
                         again...!

                                     TERRY
                         Of course you will, Sammy. You never 
                         have to worry about that.

                                     SAMMY
                         Please don't go till you know where 
                         you're going. Please...!

                                     TERRY
                         I do know where I'm going. I'm going 
                         to Worcester and I'm gonna try to 
                         see that girl. And then depending on 
                         what happens there, I thought I'd 
                         try to see if there's any work for 
                         me out West. And if there is, I'm 
                         gonna head out there for the summer 
                         and try to make some money. And if 
                         there isn't, I'll figure something 
                         else out. Maybe I'll stay around the 
                         East. I don't know... I really liked 
                         it in Alaska. It was really beautiful. 
                         You just -- It made me feel good. 
                         And before things got so messed up I 
                         was doin' pretty well out there. 
                         Seriously. But I couldn't stay here 
                         long, Sammy: I don't want to live 
                         here. But I'm gonna stay in touch. 
                         And I'll be back. 'Cause I want to 
                         see you and I want to see Rudy. I'll 
                         come home for Christmas. How about 
                         that? We'll have Christmas together.
                              (Pause)
                         Come on, Sammy. You can trust me...

               Still looking down, Sammy shakes her head, tears leaking 
               down her cheeks.

                                     TERRY
                         Come on, Sammy... Look at me... Look 
                         at me...

               She looks at him.

                                     TERRY
                         Hey, Sammy... Remember when we were 
                         kids, remember what we always used 
                         to say to each other . . .?
                              (Pause)
                         Remember when we were kids?

                                     SAMMY
                         Of course I do...!

               She throws her arms around his neck. He pats her gently.

               INT./EXT. BUS. DAY

               The DOORS OPEN and Terry comes up the steps and into the 
               bus. Outside, Sammy watches him pay the driver and move 
               through the bus toward his seat. The BUS DOORS CLOSE.

               EXT. BUS. CONTINUOUS

               Sammy waves till the BUS DRIVES all the way down MAIN STREET, 
               turns a corner and is gone.

               INT. BUS. CONTINUOUS

               Terry, in his seat, turns forward and watches the view go 
               by. He smiles a little.

               INT. SAMMY'S CAR (MOVING). DAY

               The morning sunlight flickers through the windshield into 
               the car as Sammy drives along toward work. She passes the 
               TOWN HALL CLOCK and sees that it's 9:20.

               She dries her damp cheek with a forearm and rolls down her 
               window to let the morning breeze blow through.

               Squaring her shoulders a little, she drives through town at 
               a slow and easy pace.

                                         THE END
