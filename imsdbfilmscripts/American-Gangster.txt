1   EXT. JAZZ CLUB - DAY                                                  1

    A tall, handsome man in a dark suit emerges from a Lincoln
    Towncar and enters a small, basement R&B/Jazz club.

    He approaches a booth, says something in the din to the men
    there, then calmly shoots them and exits.

3   EXT. HARLEM STREET - DAY (NOVEMBER)                                   3

    Bumpy Johnson, an elderly but still sturdy black man,
    elegantly dressed - cashmere overcoat, gloves, Homburg -
    stands in falling snow atop a flatbed truck - as he does
    every Thanksgiving - tossing down turkeys to the poor -
    like a benign king.

    Legend:   Harlem

    A younger man, the gunman from the club - Frank Lucas -
    Bumpy's driver/bodyguard/collector/protege - watches from
    below.

4   INT/EXT. STREET / DISCOUNT EMPORIUM - DAY (NOVEMBER)                  4

    Whispering gunfire from a television set veiled by
    foreground snow: Soldiers in the jungles of Vietnam in
    1970. A rich, cultured, authoritative voice offers:
                            BUMPY O/S
               This is the problem. This is what's
               wrong with America.

    The war footage multiplies by twenty: a stack of TVs with
    price tags dangling from the knobs behind a display window.

                            BUMPY O/S
               It's gotten so big you can't find your
               way.

    People on the sidewalk, out of respect or fear, part to let
    Frank and Bumpy and Bumpy's German shepherd pass.

                            BUMPY
               The corner grocery's a supermarket.
               Candy store's a MacDonald's. And this
               place.

                              BUMPY (CONT'D)
                 Where's the pride of ownership here?
                 Where's the personal service? Does
                 anybody work here?

    Inside, the emporium is vast, with aisles that seem to
    stretch off into infinity. The TVs give way to a display
    window full of Japanese stereo componentry.

                              BUMPY
                 What right do they have cutting out the
                 suppliers, pushing all the middlemen out,
                 buying direct from the manufacturer -
                 Sony this, Toshiba that, all them Chinks -
                 putting Americans out of work?

    He's not really asking Frank, so Frank doesn't answer.

                              BUMPY
                 What am I supposed to do with a place
                 like this, Frank? Who am I supposed to
                 ask for, the assistant manager?
                        (pause)
                 This is the problem. This is the way it
                 is now: You can't find the heart of
                 anything to stick the knife.

    Bumpy stops before a display of cameras and stares in.
    They're all pointed at him as a pain grips his chest and he
    sinks to his knees. Frank kneels down.

                               FRANK
                 What is it?

    Bumpy seems unable to speak, looks to Frank confused.
                              FRANK
                 Somebody call an ambulance!

    But the store suddenly seems empty. Frank yells into the
    emporium but can't be heard above the Muzak and the cash
    registers ringing up sales Bumpy will never see a piece of.
    Looking up at Frank, Bumpy manages weakly -

                              BUMPY
                 Forget it, Frank. No one's in charge.

5   EXT. BUMPY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                        5

    Limousines from the funeral disgorge mourners: family,
    friends, celebrities, politicians. Cops on horseback move
    through the enormous crowd that has gathered to watch. FBI
    agents in cars snap pictures with long lenses of Italian
    mobsters like Albert Tosca.

                                                                     (CONT)

                 - whose passing has brought together a
                 who's who of mourners on this chilly
                 afternoon. The Governor has come down.
                 The mayor of New York - its Chief of
                 Police and Commissioner - sports and
                 entertainment luminaries -

    A white Bentley pulls up, disgorging Jackie Fox - the
    original Superfly - and his entourage. With his trademark
    tinted Gucci glasses on, he happily poses for anyone with a
    camera - including the Feds - before going inside.

6   INT. BUMPY'S APARTMENT - LATER                                     6

    The report continues on a TV no one's really watching here:
    a March of Time-like history of Bumpy Johnson, famed Harlem
    gangster, Robin Hood and killer.

                              REPORTER ON TV
                 He was a Great Man, according to the
                 eulogies. A giving man. A man of the
                 people. No one chose to include in their
                 remembrances the word most often
                 associated with Ellsworth Bumpy Johnson:
                 Gangster.

    Sitting off by himself in Bumpy's elegant garden apartment,
    heretofore his private sanctuary, Frank surveys the mourners
    circling the place like vultures:

    Tango Black, a huge brute, scavenging the catered food and
    tended bar ... Jackie Fox, surrounded by his ever-present
    coterie of sycophants ... Albert Tosca, an elegant Italian
    capo, and an underling, Rossi, at the bar.

                              TOSCA
                 White wine, please.

    A white man who looks like a banker - and is - sits down
    next to Frank.

                              BANKER
                 How you doing, Frank?

                              FRANK
                 All right.

                              BANKER
                 What a loss.
                        (Frank nods)
                 How are you otherwise?   Things okay
                 financially?
                                                                    (CONT)

    Frank doesn't say. It feels unseemly to him to be talking
    about money here. He watches Tango carelessly set a watery
    glass of ice on an antique inlaid chess table.

                              BANKER
                 Bumpy set something up for you?

    Frank excuses himself without an answer, crosses to where
    Tango left the glass, and sets it on a coaster.

                              TANGO
                 Hey, Frank, get me an ashtray while
                 you're at it.

    Bumpy's German shepherd watches as Frank reaches into his
    jacket, revealing a gun nestled in its shoulder holster. He
    takes out a handkerchief, wipes the condensation dry, opens
    a drawer and removes an ashtray. He holds it out to Tango -
    who isn't sure it's not a dare and decides to wander off.

                              CHARLIE
                 I know you're hurting, Frank.    So am I.

    Frank sits back down with Charlie Williams, an older dope
    man.

                              CHARLIE
                 You going to be all right?

                             FRANK
                 Yeah.

                              CHARLIE
                 I'm sure Bumpy never told you, but he
                 made me promise, anything ever happened
                 to him, I'd make sure you didn't go
                 without.

                              FRANK
                 I'll be fine, Charlie. Half the people
                 here owed Bumpy money when he died. A
                 lot of money. If they think I'm going
                 to forget to collect, they're wrong.

                              CHARLIE
                 That's the spirit. Go get them.

    On the TV, over archive film and photographs of crime
    figures from the 1940's and `50's, the opinion is offered
    that Bumpy's death "marks the end of an era ..."

                                                                     5.
                              




A7   INT. CLASSROOM - NIGHT                                           A7

     A figure, his back to us, walks slowly toward a blackboard
     like a man to the gallows.

                             RICHIE V.O.
                I live in fear of hearing my name

     Richie Roberts turns and faces his classmates, all of them a
     decade or more younger than him.

7    EXT. MOTEL - NEW JERSEY - DAY                                        7

     Harlem's jagged teeth skyline juts across the river at the
     other end of the George Washington Bridge. On this side - a
     sledgehammer gripped in Richie's fist, on the move, suddenly
     fills the frame.

                             RICHIE                                           
                You know the Number 1 fear of most                            
                people isn't dying; it's public speaking.                     
                They get physically ill. They throw up.                       

                             RIVERA                                           
                And that's what you want to do for a
                living.

                             RICHIE
                I don't like being like that.     I want to                   
                beat it.

     Armed with the sledgehammer, Richie and his partner - Javy               
     Rivera - come past a seedy motel office where a TV shows                 
     another report about Bumpy Johnson.

     Legend:   New Jersey

     A motel clerk looks up, glimpses the sledgehammer -


                                                                    (CONT)

                              CLERK
                 Hey -

    Rivera flashes a New Jersey detective's shield without                   
    breaking stride. Takes a subpoena out of another pocket.                 

                              RIVERA                                         
                 Who's going to do this?                                     

                              RICHIE
                 He knows me, he'll take it from me.                         
                 I've known him since high school.                           

                              RIVERA                                         
                 Just throw it in, he doesn't take it.                       
                 That's good service.                                        

    They reach a particular motel room door. Rivera knocks.                  
    The door opens the length of a chain, revealing a wise guy
    in an undershirt, who, when he sees the subpoena, start to               
    close the door -                                                         

                              RIVERA                                         
                 Throw it -                                                  

    As Richie flings the subpoena in, the door slams on his                  
    hand. He wails in agony, tries to shoulder it open, hears                
    the dead bolt lock on the other side, feels Campizi's teeth              
    bite into his fingers, watches his blood run down the frame.             

                              RIVERA                                         
                 Down -                                                      

    Richie hangs down from his hand as the sledgehammer swings               
    past his head shattering the door -                                      

8   INT/EXT. MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                   8

    The door rips from its hinges and the detectives crash in.
    The wise guy - Campizi - hurries for the bathroom, slams the             
    door. This one's hollow and the detectives more easily                   
    break through it -                                                       

    Campizi tries to climb out the bathroom window. Richie                   
    grabs him, throws him into the shower stall, taking the
    plastic curtain down with them, smearing it with blood as
    Richie beats at him before Rivera can pull him off.

    A male paramedic attends to Campizi's bloodied face while a
    female paramedic cleans Richie's bloodied hand.

                               CAMPIZI
                  I swear to God, Richie, I didn't know it
                  was you. I would never slam a door on
                  your hand. Knowingly.

                               RICHIE
                  You bit my fuckin hand -

     Richie lunges at him, hits him again with his injured hand -
     which hurts Richie more than it does Campizi. The
     paramedics manage to pull him away.

                               CAMPIZI
                  What can we do, Richie? You don't want
                  to do this. For old times sake, what can
                  we do? Who do you want? Who can I give
                  you? You want Big Sal's bookie? You want
                  his accountant? I'll give him to you.

     Richie regards him a moment. A policy ring's accountant
     wouldn't be bad. He glances back to his paramedic dabbing
     at his bloody hand, and notices she's not bad-looking. She
     smiles back.

10   INT. NY POLICE HQ - ENTRANCE/STAIRS - DAY                        10

     Four men in long black leather coats stride toward like
     they own the city. It's impossible to tell if they're cops
     or gangsters.

     Legend:   New York City

11   INT. NEW YORK POLICE ANNEX - PROPERTY ROOM - DAY                 11
     One of the same undercover cops - Detective Trupo -
     scribbles a signature and badge number different from the
     one on his gold shield lying next to the voucher requesting
     evidence needed in court.

     He pushes the voucher under a sign - "All Handguns and
     Narcotics Before 10am Next Window" - to a clerk who takes it
     past floor-to-ceiling shelves covered with files, plastic
     bags bulging with handguns, knives and gambling receipts.
     Bulkier items - like shotguns and baseball bats - lie
     unwrapped with dangling tags.

     The clerk reaches a chain-link cage where the most valuable
     items are locked up - narcotics, pornography, cash - checks
     the voucher against tags, takes down an old green suitcase.

                                                                          8.
                                    




12        EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY                                             12

          Trupo's car - a Shelby Mustang - roars up. He climbs out,
          crosses to a warehouse with the suitcase as the other three
          SIU Princes of the City follow from another car, cradling
          grocery bags.

13        INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY                                             13

          Trupo snaps the suitcase open revealing five half-kilo bags
          of uncut heroin in clear plastic bags. The other cops pull
          from the grocery bags: a Pyrex mixing bowl, flour sifter,
          boxes of milk-sugar, latex kitchen gloves, a medical scale,
          and yellow baggies.

          Hands peel back the distinctive black and green "evidence"
          tape on the clear plastic bags. Dump the heroin into twenty
          yellow baggies. A half-kilo of lactose is poured into each
          of the now-empty property room bags.

                                 TRUPO
                    Now just enough for the reagent test.

          He removes one tablespoon of heroin from each of the
          baggies, and the now-almost-heroin-free powder is mixed
          through the flour sifter, poured back into the clear bags,
          the tape resealed, the bags returned to the suitcase.

14        INT. NY COURTROOM - DAY                                          14

          The suitcase and   "heroin," and some weapons and money, have
          been arranged on   an evidence table with the care of a Macy's
          display window.    Trupo - the officer in charge of the case -
          watches the jury   files in -

          A Lincoln Continental pulls up. Trupo climbs out of his
          Shelby with a sports bag, crosses to the Lincoln, climbs in
          back where an Italian wise guy - Rossi - sits. Trupo unzips
          the bag revealing the recut heroin - in the yellow plastic.

                                 ROSSI V/O
                    This is the French Connection dope.

       Frank comes into an empty bar, chairs up on tables. A
       middle-aged man mopping up glances up at him as he crosses
       to a back room.

                              ROSSI V/O
                 They seize it, arrest everybody,

       Several ounces of the dope sits in foreground on a table.

                 They basically control the market with

       As is his custom, Frank eats breakfast alone. A middle-
       aged waitress appears when he's done, picks up his plate
       and refills his coffee.

                                 FRANK
                    Thank you, Charlene.      Last one.

                    stay all day if you want, but I wouldn't.
                    It's nice outside.

                    Then maybe I'll have to go for a walk.
                    Just cause you said so.

       She smiles and leaves. Frank pours some sugar in his
       coffee. Someone taps on the window and he looks up, sees
       two servicemen - one in uniform - one he recognizes.

       Corner apartment above the street. A girl sits smoking at
       a work table covered with drug-cutting apparatus. Another -
       Frank's cutter and sometimes-girlfriend, Red Top - sets a
       couple of packets of heroin in front of the servicemen.

          Frank nods, you're welcome before the man can thank him.
          The servicemen start cooking up the dope.

          Across the river, Richie, Rivera and Campizi sit in the car             
          parked across from a closed social club. A man carrying a
          grocery bag comes out and Campizi ducks lower in the seat.

                       That's him.

          Newsboy Moriarty's mob accountant puts the grocery bag in

               All right.   Get lost.    Get out.

     Campizi slinks out of the car. Richie and Rivera follow

     All the other cars are gone. Rivera climbs into Richie's              
     with coffee and a Coke in a bag, hands him the can.

               Think he made us?

     Richie doesn't know. Glances at his watch.      Cranes in his
     seat to look behind them.
                            RICHIE
               You called for the warrant?     Where are

               I just called. I called and walked back
               here and ten seconds has gone by.

     Richie watches an attendant lock up, listens to the street
     lamps buzz, grows impatient. Indicating the other car:

                               RICHIE
                  I got night school.

                  Guess you're going to miss it.
                         (Rivera sips at his coffee;                           
                          then:)                                               
                  You know, what you were saying before
                  - about throwing up in front of people -
                  money will take that feeling away.

                               RICHIE
                  Not when it's less.

                               RICHIE
                  Than what I make now.

                               RICHIE
                  They do in the Prosecutor's Office.
                  Three thousand less.

                  You're fuckin kidding me.

     Richie isn't kidding. Rivera stares at him like he's crazy.               
     Richie checks his watch. He's waited long enough.

                                RICHIE
                  Fuck this -

                  Richie -

     Richie gets out, opens the trunk, grabs a Slimjim and
     bolt cutters, cuts through a gate chain and strides to the
     accountant's car, Rivera following. Richie trips the                      
     passenger door lock and pulls at the trunk release, and, as
     he comes around back to search it -

                                                                      (CONT)

                               RICHIE
                  Check inside.

     Rivera may as well; the damage to the case, if there is one           
     anymore, is done. He crawls inside the car to look under
     the seats and in the glove compartment. Gravely -

                              RICHIE
                  Javy ...                                                 

     Richie's staring into the trunk like there's a body inside.
     Rivera comes over, takes a look, sees it's money: stacks of           
     it rubber-banded together, spilling from grocery bags - more          
     than either of them has ever seen. As the trunk closes -              

29   EXT. PARKING LOT / RICHIE'S CAR - LATER - NIGHT                  29   

     Richie and Rivera sit in their car in silence, staring out            
     at the car with the money in it. Eventually -                         

                               RICHIE
                  This isn't a couple of bucks.

                               RIVERA                                      
                  It's the same thing.   In principle.

                               RICHIE
                  We're talking about principle?

                               RIVERA                                      
                  Richie, a cop who turns in this kind of
                  money says one thing: He'll turn in cops
                  who take money. We'll be pariahs.
                               RICHIE
                  We're fucked either way.

                               RIVERA                                      
                  Not if we keep it. Only if we don't.
                  Then we're fucked, you're right. But not
                  if we keep it.

                               RICHIE
                         (more to himself)
                  Yes, we are.

                               RIVERA                                      
                  Goddamn it, did we ask for this? Did we
                  put a gun to someone's head and say, Give
                  us your money? Cops kill cops they can't                 
                  trust. We can't turn it in.                              

     They regard each other again in silence ...

                                                                 15.
                           




30   INT. NEWARK POLICE STATION - LATER - NIGHT                    30

     As a police captain counts the stacks of money, Lou Toback,
     Richie's superior from the prosecutors office, walks in, his
     night out interrupted by this emergency. He crossed to where
     Richie and Rivera sit alone in a corner. Quietly:                    

                            TOBACK
               How much.

                            RICHIE
               Nine hundred and eighty thousand.

                            TOBACK
               What happened to the rest?

     It's a joke but isn't funny, not even to Toback. He regards
     his men who turned it in, then the other cops in the place -
     who are watching them and the money being counted. Toback
     walks over to the captain, and, quietly:

                            TOBACK
               What're you doing counting this in front                   
               of everybody? Are you out of your fuckin
               mind? Take it into a room. Now.

     Richie's glance to Rivera says, You're right, we're fucked.          

31   INT/EXT. NEWARK POLICE STATION - PRE-DAWN                     31

     As Richie leaves alone, he's aware of all the eyes on him -
     knowing the other cops' looks don't signify awe or respect,
     but contempt and fear, like Rivera predicted. Neither will           
     ever be trusted again. He climbs into his car, drives off.
32   INT. DINER - HARLEM - DAY                                     32

     Tango and his bodyguard come in and approach Frank's table
     where he reads the morning paper as he eats breakfast.

                            TANGO
               Didn't you see the jar, Frank?
               I think you walked right past it.

     Frank ignores him, forks at his eggs, eats.    Tango sits.

                            TANGO
               The money jar. On the corner.      What I
               got to do, put a sign on it?

     Frank indicates that he would answer if his mouth wasn't
     full. He swallows finally, but then only reaches for his
     coffee cup to take a sip, further irritating Tango.
                                                                 (CONT)

                               TANGO
                  Bumpy don't own 116th Street no more,
                  Frank. Bumpy don't own no real estate in
                  Harlem no more. I'm the landlord now and
                  the lease is twenty-percent.

     Frank dabs at his mouth with a napkin and gives Tango a look
     that says that won't be happening.

                               TANGO
                  Then don't sell dope, Frank. Get a
                  fuckin job. You need a job? You can be
                  my driver, drive me around, open my door,
                  yes, sir, no sir, where to, sir, right
                  away, Massa Johnson, sir.

     Right now Tango is dead. No doubt about it.          On the
     surface, though, Frank remains cool.

                               FRANK
                  Twenty percent?

                               TANGO
                  Of every dollar. Every VIG, every
                  truckload, every girl, every ounce.      In
                  the jar.

                               FRANK
                  Twenty percent's my profit. If I'm
                  giving it to you then what am I doing?
                  Twenty percent puts me, and everyone you
                  know, out of business, which puts you out
                  of business.
                         (reaches for his breakfast
                          check)
                  There are ways to make money
                  legitimately, and then there's this way.
                  Not even Bumpy took twenty percent.

                               TANGO
                  Bumpy's fuckin dead.

     Frank regards Tango a moment, gets up, takes out his money
     clip, covers the check on the table with a five, peels off a
     $1 bill from the clip, tosses it down in front of Tango.

                                FRANK
                  There.   That's twenty-percent.

     As he turns and leaves, Tango watches after him ...

                                                                 17.

     Stitched-up, black and blue hands dump a can of soup in a
     pot, put it on the stove.

     A pencil clutched by long fingers scribbles figures. But
     no matter how many times Frank does the arithmetic, there's
     not much left, he calculates, after he pays the Italian
     suppliers and, if he were to, Tango.

35   INT. RICHIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CONTINUED                   35     

     Richie has moved to a small desk cluttered with law
     textbooks. He cracks one open to study for the New Jersey            
     Bar exam as he eats the soup out of the pot he heated it in.         
     Above him on the wall is a framed photograph of Joe Louis            
     standing over a sprawled-on-the-mat Billy Conn.                      

36   EXT. CONEY ISLAND - BEACH - DAY - INTERCUT                    36

     A bleak day. Seagulls fighting over scraps on the sand as
     others hover overhead, flapping and cawing. Alone near the
     water, Frank tosses a stick for the German shepherd he
     inherited.

37   INT. RICHIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - INTERCUT                    37     

     Richie opens a small wooden box in his bleak apartment,
     revealing an ounce of marijuana, rolling papers and clips.
     As he rolls a joint -

                            BUMPY V/O
               A leader is like a shepherd -

38   EXT. CONEY ISLAND - BEACH - DAY - CONTINUED                   38

     The sounds of the gulls and surf and roller coaster begin to
     fade as Frank throws the stick again.

                            BUMPY V/O
               Sends the fast nimble sheep out front,
               and the others follow as the shepherd
               walks quietly behind -

     The dog retrieves the stick, but this time - somehow - it's
     to Bumpy's hand he returns it. Frank listens attentively.

                            BUMPY
               He's got the stick - the cane - and
               he'll use if he has to.

                  But most of the time he doesn't have to.
                  He moves the whole herd - quietly.

     Bumpy smiles and tosses the stick.

     The smoke from the joint rises to the ceiling as Richie               
     studies.

     The dog trots back to Bumpy and Frank with the stick.

41   EXT. BOARDWALK - CONEY ISLAND - LATER                            41

     Hot dog stand. Bumpy hands a hot dog to Frank, holds out
     another to the shepherd. To camera:

                               BUMPY
                  What right do they have cutting out the
                  suppliers, the middlemen, buying direct,
                  putting Americans out of work ... This
                  is the way it is now, Frank.

     Frank nods. The vender hands him a napkin. The shepherd
     is still with him, but Bumpy is gone, and the gulls and the
     people on the roller coaster squeal as Frank comes out of
     his meditative trance with an idea.

     A needle pierces the crook of Frank's arm.       Slight grimace.
     A cotton ball is pushed onto the puncture.       Malaria shot.
43   CLOSE-UP: (PHOTOGRAPHY SHOP)                                     43

     Keys turn the locks of a safety-deposit box. The lid lifts
     revealing decks of cash. Frank takes it all out, slips one
     slender packet into Bumpy's banker's jacket pocket.

                               FRANK
                  Get yourself a new suit.

        The sound of the plane growls and fades overhead as Richie's
        ex-wife keeps an eye on their son playing on a grassy area.

                  I don't know, Richie.

                               RICHIE
                  It couldn't be avoided. Next weekend
                  I'll be able to take him.

        She regards him with a weary look, but he's looking over at
        one of the other - better-looking - moms in the park.

                                LAURIE
                  I'm moving.

        He looks back, not sure he heard right.

                                RICHIE
                  What?   Where?

                  To the St. Regis, what do you care.
                         (pause)
                  My sister's.

                               RICHIE
                  Your sister's. In Vegas?

        He glances away to a sound: shattering glass.        Some teen-
        agers breaking bottles on the ground.

                               RICHIE
                  You can't move to Vegas.     Not with
                  Michael anyway.

                               LAURIE
                  What am I supposed to do with him?       Leave
                  him with you? There's a picture.

                  Hey, you want to shut up over there?

     The teenagers ignore him. He tries to ignore them, but it's
     hard with the constant noise.

                               RICHIE
                  No court will allow it for one thing.
                  I won't allow it.

     Their son glances over at them. Richie looks over at the
     teenagers again breaking bottles, then back to Laurie.

                               RICHIE
                  Laurie, you can't raise a kid in Las

                  Oh, like this is a good environment.
                  Around your friends. There are less

                  Goddamn it -

     The noise of the glass is driving him crazy. He strides
     over to the teenagers, who look at him like, What are you
     gonna do, old man, it's four against one.

                               RICHIE
                  I told you nice to shut the fuck up.
                  Now I'm gonna kill you.

     He pulls out his gun and aims it at one of them, then the
     others. All instinctively try to cover their heads.

        As they dive to their knees to do what they're told, Laurie
        walks away with her son, who looks back over his shoulder at
        his father with his gun out.

50      EXT. BANGKOK - NIGHT                                             50     

        Frank sits in the back of a motor samlor.       Bicycles dart
        around it like flies.

51 - 52 OMIT                                                 51 - 52 OMIT       

53      INT. SOUL BROTHERS BAR - NIGHT                                   53

        The clientele is almost exclusively black servicemen on R&R
        and Asian women. A trio of ex-GI's plays authentic Southern
        blues on a small stage. Ham hocks and collard greens come
        out of the kitchen. Smoke chokes the place.

        Frank, one of the few men not in uniform, and not drunk or
        stoned, sits alone at a table with a Coca-Cola and surveys
        the activity: Dope being rolled. Dope being smoked. Dope
        being shot. GI's and prostitutes climbing a staircase.

        His eyes follow an Army Master Sergeant, moving among the
        tables as if checking on the GI's well being. But at some,
        his hand takes money, leaves in its place packets of powder.

        The Sergeant feels eyes on him and glances up, catching
        Frank watching him from across the room. He squints through
        the smoke at the figure at the table in the shadows, and, in
        a kind of shock, more to himself -
                                 NATE
                     Frank - ?

        Frank half-lifts his glass to wave, and Nate beams.

54      INT. SOUL BROTHERS BAR - NIGHT                                   54

        Frank has guests at his table now: his cousin Nate the
        Sergeant, and two young Asian wise guys. They talk about
        him in Thai (subtitled):

                                  THAI
                     He say how much he wants?

                                  NATE
                     He said "a lot." What that means, I
                     don't know. Four or five keys?

                                                                       (CONT)

     The Thais regard Frank a moment, size him up.

                               THAI
                  He's your cousin.

                               NATE
                  My cousin-in-law.    My ex-wife's cousin.

                               THAI
                  Ask him how much he wants.

                               NATE
                  How much you gonna want, Frank?

                               FRANK
                  A hundred kilos.

     Nate blinks like there's something in his eye ...

55   EXT. BANGKOK - STREET VENDER - DAY                               55

     Steam and neon.    Frank and Nate at a crowded stand.

                               NATE
                  No one I know can get that much. It'd
                  have to be pieced together from several
                  suppliers and none of it's gonna be 100-
                  percent pure.

                               FRANK
                  That's not what I want.

                               NATE
                  I know that. But that means dealing
                  with the Chiu-Chou syndicates in Cholon
                  or Saigon - if they'll deal with you -

                               FRANK
                  No, even then it's too late. It's been
                  chopped. I want to get it where they get
                  it. From the source.

     Nate stares at him ... then laughs.       Frank doesn't.

                               NATE
                  You're gonna go get it.

                              FRANK
                  Why not.

                               NATE

       and fifty others, have been here for hours taking the exam            
       less than half of them will pass.

       A motley bunch of Thai thugs and black American soldiers
       with automatic weapons ride mules through the dense jungle
       with Nate and Frank, who - armed with a pistol, a rifle and
       ammo bandolier like Pancho Villa - is enjoying himself.
       From his POV, the jungle canopy suddenly opens up on a poppy
       field the size of Manhattan. Frank stares down at it.

B56    EXT. JUNGLE RISE / OPIUM FARM - DAY                             B56

       On the ground now with their small private army, Nate speaks
       with one of the Thais, then translates for Frank.

                                 NATE
                    He says this whole area's controlled
                    by the Kuomintang - Chiang Kai-Shek's
                    defeated army.

       Some of whom they can see down below on the opium farm -
       Chinese soldiers with outdated weapons. Frank tips his head
       to Nate at some other figures below -

                                 FRANK
                    They ain't Chinese.

       A handful of better-armed American sentries at the perimeter
       of the farm. CIA. Frank, Nate and the others hang back as
       one of the Thais steps ahead to speak to the guerillas.

       The processing center for the entire region. The Thai
       translator is with Frank to negotiate with a vanquished
       Chinese general. Other Americans and Thais guard them
       while the Chinese with their CIA advisors guard them.

      The Chinese general examines Frank's papers - passport,
      visa, bank receipts - and lots of cash - then studies Frank.

                             GENERAL
                How would you get it into the States?

                Who are you really?

                             FRANK
                It says right there.   Frank Lucas.

                             GENERAL
                I mean, who you represent?

                             FRANK
                Me.

      The man doesn't believe it, but lets it go.

                             GENERAL
                You think you're going to take a hundred
                kilos of heroin into the US and you don't
                work for anyone? Someone is going to
                allow that?

      Frank shrugs. The general regards one of his men.       In
      Chinese, subtitled:

                             GENERAL
                I don't believe a word of this.

      The general regards the cash and paperwork again for a
      moment. And, to Frank:

                             GENERAL
                After this first purchase, if you're not
                killed by Marseilles importers - or their
                people in the States - then what?

                   Then there'd be more. On a regular basis.
                   Though I'd rather not have to drag my ass
                   all the way up here every time.

      The man regards Frank for a long moment.       Glances back to
      the cash and paperwork again. Finally -

                                GENERAL
                   Of course not.

      Torrential monsoon rains. Dripping camouflage. Nate and
      Frank climb down from the Huey. Frank no longer wears the
      bandolier. Now a press card dangles from his neck.

      Nate and Frank watch the colonel emerge from the tent and
      cross through the rain on duck-boards to another tent to
      speak with a white officer, a 2-star general.

                                NATE
                   Fifty grand. In advance. That'll
                   cover them, the pilots and the guys on

                   A hundred. And it's all I got left. So

      He holds out a business envelope fat with money. Nate
      hesitates, knowing Frank has just said he'll kill him if
      things don't go right, then takes it.

56    INT. RICHIE'S APARTMENT - NEWARK - DAWN                            56

      The nurse/paramedic who stitched up his hand is in Richie's
      bed making so much noise he's worried someone will call the
      cops. The phone rings. And won't stop. Neither will the
      nurse as Richie answers it -

                   fuckin guy "made" me - I don't know how
                   but he did. He went for his gun. I had
                   to do it, I swear to God. Now they're
                   going to kill me.

      Richie can hear in Sander's voice how serious it is and
      manages to disentangle himself from the woman.

      Richie on his police radio, which cuts in and out -

                                DISPATCHER
                   There are no cars in that area,
                   Detective Roberts.

                                RICHIE
                   Bullshit. I got a man in trouble and I
                   need back-up.

                                DISPATCHER
                   I missed that - you're breaking up -

                   I just did. No one responded.     I'll try
                   again, but -

      He slams the mic down.

57    EXT. STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS - MORNING                            57

      As Richie's car turns a corner, the Stephen Crane Projects -
      the most foreboding place on earth - rises up: three dark
      30-floor towers planted on war-torn grounds where a long-ago
      torched and abandoned patrol car sits like a monument.

      He parks and moves through an agitated all-black crowd, past
      an ambulance outside one of the towers, through oppressive
      heat. It's riot weather.

58    INT. STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS - MORNING                            58

      Drugs on a coffee table. Body on the floor. Rivera,                     
      despondent, on the couch. The male paramedics, scared.                  
      Richie on the phone -

      Dial tone: the police sergeant has hung up on him.           Richie       
      throws the phone. The paramedics stare at him.                            

                                PARAMEDIC
                   You got no back-up? Why is that?                             

      The only other person who would know the answer to that is
      Rivera, who just shakes his head in despair.                              

                                RICHIE

                                PARAMEDIC
                   Detective ... he's dead.

                                RICHIE
                   I know he's fucking dead. Bandage his
                   head, clean him up, put him on a gurney
                   and prop it up so he's sitting. And open
                   his eyes.

59    EXT. STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS - MORNING                              59

      Richie comes out ahead of the gurney, moving quickly like
      it's a matter of life and death (which it is), motioning at
      the crowd to allow a path to the ambulance.

                                RICHIE
                   Step back, injured man coming out. Let
                   them do their job and he'll be all right.
                   Ma'am. Excuse me. Step back. Sir.
                   Please.

      The people step back when they see the victim on the gurney:
      tubes in his nostrils, IV in his arm, eyes open. Before they
      can look any closer, he's put in the ambulance. As it pulls
      out, siren wailing, Richie leads Rivera safely away -                     

A60   EXT. ALLEY NEAR STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS - MORNING                  A60

      They cross through an alley near the Projects and Rivera                  
      finally breathes a sigh of relief.

      The words aren't out of his mouth before Richie shoves him                
      up against a car.

                     own kind. And you know why.

        He takes out his car keys, turns to leave. Comes past                   
        Richie who grabs his arm and pushes the sleeve up exposing a            
        line of puncture scabs and scars.

                                  RICHIE

                     You know who'll work with me after that?
                     Same as you. No one.

        Richie squeezes Rivera's hand around the car key.                       

                                  RICHIE
                     Don't look down there. Look here.

                     You ever fuckin threaten me again, I'll
                     kill you.

        Richie squeezes Sander's hand so hard the car key cuts
        through the skin, drawing blood.

70      EXT. ARMY BASE, NEW JERSEY - DUSK                                70
        Silence. Marshland. A beat-up Chevy parked alongside a
        perimeter fence. Frank waits by the car as a military Jeep
        with its lights out comes across a firing range. It slows,
        stops. In it, the silhouettes of three servicemen, black,
        armed with M-16's. Silence again, before:

                                  ARMY CAPTAIN
                     Open the trunk.

        Frank does it, then stands aside as the other servicemen
        drag four large taped-up duffel bags from the Jeep to his
        car, lift them into his trunk and slam it shut.

        The duffel bags, still closed, on a table. Frank regards
        them, nursing a drink, putting off the moment of discovery
        that he has perhaps spent his life's savings on nothing.
                                                                       (CONT)

      The German shepherd watches as Frank removes the tape from
      one of the bags. He pulls it open - has almost no reaction -
      except to breathe again - then opens the next, and the next.

      And we see: Several brick-like packages of No. 4 heroin
      wrapped in paper marked with Chinese writing, stamped with
      a label: two lions on their hind legs, paws on a globe,
      and, in English: DOUBLE UOGLOBE BRAND 100%.

      The duffel bags are elsewhere. The only evidence of any
      drugs is the small amount Frank has given a chemist - who
      looks like a Harvard student - to test. It responds                     
      instantly. The young man looks at Frank.                                

                                CHEMIST
                   Typically what I see is 25 to 45                           
                   percent pure. I've never seen anything                     
                   like this. No alkaloids, no adulterants,                   
                   no dilutents. It's a hundred percent.                      
                   May I?                                                     

      The chemist opens a leather travel syringe kit to shoot up,             
      but Frank gives him some to take home instead.                          

                                FRANK                                         
                   Take it with you. I don't want to have                     
                   to call the coroner.                                       

      The chemist gathers his things to leave, offering a last                
      piece of advice -

      A clapboard house set down on a piece of land that was
      probably once worked by sharecroppers. An elderly woman
      framed in a lit kitchen window, doing dishes.

      Dark yew trees and scavenged, discarded cars and car parts
      like patches of rusty snow. Crickets and bullfrogs. From a
      mound of dirt, a young man hurls a baseball to another with
      a catcher's mitt exactly sixty feet away. The kid's got a
      major league arm.

     A greasy phone on the workbench rings and another

     answers.

73   INT. COURTROOM - DAY                                               73

     Divorced couples in custody battles wait with their                       
     attorneys in a packed courthouse. An lawyer carrying papers               
     clipped with a $10 bill, comes past Richie, who's sitting                 
     with his lawyer, a woman he's probably slept with.

                  I'm not talking about your proclivities,

                               SHEILA
                  Because it'll come out. You're going to
                  have to sit down with shrinks and social
                  workers, her lawyers, the judge, lots of

     Frank and the dog in the back yard of a suburban house.
     His neighbors - those he can see - are white. He hears a
     sound - cars arriving - and crosses toward the house where
     a sold "For Sale" sign leans against a half-built kennel.

     Out front, a caravan of cars and pickup trucks - North
     Carolina plates - loaded with boxes and suitcases - has just
     arrived. Exhausted from the drive but excited to be here,
     the travelers climb out: Frank's five brothers, their wives
     and kids, and their mother.

     Teddy thinks it's the right place. The others aren't as
     sure. The house is too nice. There's a new Lincoln Towncar
     parked outside the garage. They'll probably be shot for
     trespassing.
     The front door opens and Frank comes out, trailed by his
     dog. He first gathers his mother in an embrace, then each
     of his startled brothers.

     The house is alive with the noise of family and scent of
     home-cooked food as the extended Lucas clan - there's more
     than twenty of them - sits around a big dining room table
     passing the platters around. Frank, at the head of the
     table, clearly loves having them all here.

                  He got an arm on him.     Major League arm,
                  ain't that right.

     year-old boy seen pitching in the North Carolina back yard -
     tries to shrug.

                  head off. We're talking 95-mile-an-hour.
                  You know how fast that is? You see the
                  ball leave his hand, and that's the last
                  you see it before it knocks you down.

     The wonderful noise continues downstairs as Frank leads his
     mother on a tour of the upstairs. The place is a showroom
     of traditional Americana.

                               FRANK
                  This is your room.

     Mrs. Lucas is   in awe of the splendor of the bedroom and its
     furnishings.    It's unlike anything she's used ever seen -
     not Graceland   exactly - but not far off. Her eyes settle on
     an old vanity   dotted with French perfume bottles.

                               MRS. LUCAS
                  How did you ...

                               FRANK
                  I had it made. From memory.
                               MRS. LUCAS
                  You were five when they took it away.
                  How could you remember it?

                                FRANK
                  I remember.

     She's stunned. Touches the reproduction of the vanity her
     son last saw more than thirty years ago.

                               MRS. LUCAS
                  It's perfect.
                         (looks at the room)
                  It's all perfect.
                         (she looks at him)

77   EXT. HUDSON RIVER - DAY                                       77

     The Statue of Liberty against the New York skyline.

                            FRANK V/O
               The man I worked for ran one of the
               biggest companies in New York City for
               almost fifty years.

78   EXT. HARLEM - DAY                                             78

     As Frank leads his brothers down the sidewalk, the Towncar
     that was parked at the Teaneck house, driven by Frank's body-
     guard, Doc, follows alongside at the same pace they walk.

                            FRANK
               I was with him every day for fifteen of
               them, looking after him, taking care of
               things, protecting him, learning from
               him.

     The brothers can't help but notice the storekeepers who wave
     to Frank, the women who smile, the men who step out of his
     path like there's a red carpet under his polished shoes.

                            FRANK
               Bumpy was rich, but never white   man rich.
               Why? Because he didn't own the    company.
               He thought he did. He didn't.     He only
               managed it. Someone else owned    it. So
               they owned him.

79   INT/EXT. REDTOP'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HARLEM - DAY           79
     Frank leads his brothers up the stairs and down the hall.

                            FRANK
               Nobody owns me. Because I own my
               company.

               better than the competition's at a price
               that's lower.

     Frank stops outside an apartment door.

               What are we selling, Frank?

     Frank pushes the door open, revealing -

80   INT. REDTOP'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS - DAY                        80

     Five naked women at work tables, their faces veiled by
     surgical masks, cutting heroin with lactose and quinine in a
     precise mixture of controlled purity. The Lucas brothers
     stare as the supervisor of the activity - clothed, with red
     hair - comes over.

                               REDTOP
                  Hi, Frank.

                               FRANK
                  Honey, these are my brothers.

81   EXT. HARLEM - LATER - DAY                                         81

     Tango strolls down the street like he's the Godfather of
     Harlem, girl on his arm, bodyguard at his side.

82   INT. DINER - SAME TIME                                            82

     As his brothers eat lunch, Frank - who can see Tango outside
     - uncaps a glass sugar container.

                               FRANK
                  What matters in business is honesty,
                  integrity, hard work, loyalty, and never
                  forgetting where you came from.

     For reasons his brothers can't imagine, Frank empties all
     sugar from the container onto his plate.
                               FRANK
                  You are what you are and that's one of
                  two things. You're nothing ... or you're
                  something. Understand what I'm saying?

     The brothers nod tentatively, stare at the now-empty glass
     container. Frank wipes his mouth with a napkin, gets up.

                               FRANK
                  I'll be right back.

83   EXT/INT. DINER - MOMENTS LATER                                    83

     He comes out of the diner, crosses the street toward Tango,
     who's buying fruit. Greets him cheerfully -

                               FRANK
                  Hey, Tango, what's up.    I was just
                  thinking about you.

                               FRANK (CONT'D)
                  I was looking at the jar and you know
                  what? I didn't    see nothing in it.

                               TANGO
                  The fuck you want, Frank -

     Before the last word is out of Tango's mouth, Frank's got a
     gun pressed against his forehead. Silence. Everyone backs
     away - the bodyguard, too. Tango's girl pulls her arm from
     his and takes off. Eventually -

                               TANGO
                  What're you going to do, boy? Shoot me
                  in broad daylight? In front of everyone?

     It's as if life on the street has stopped. No one moves;
     everyone is looking at Frank; maybe that's what he wants.
     As Tango laughs at the thought -

                               FRANK
                  Yeah, that's right.

     Frank pulls the trigger and the big man falls back like
     someone hit with a board. Frank stands over him and empties
     the gun in his chest, the shots echoing down the street.

     Then it's quiet again. Everyone's still looking him, but
     Frank doesn't run. Instead, he calmly reaches into Tango's
     suit pocket, takes out a money clip thick with cash, drops
     it in the "jar" and sets it next to the body.

                               FRANK
                  For the cops. Should be enough.

     Frank returns to the diner and sits back down, ignoring the
     astonished stares from his brothers and everyone else in the
     place. Tries to remember where he was in his lecture as he
     tucks the napkin back in his shirt collar.

                               FRANK
                  That basically's the whole picture right
                  there.

84   INT. MORGUE - NIGHT                                              84

     A cadaver drawer slides open revealing - not Tango - but
     Rivera, staring up lifeless, his arms, stomach, legs and                
     toes dotted with the scabs of a longtime addict.

     The medical examiner slides open another cadaver drawer
     containing her body. Richie stares at it.

                               DETECTIVE
                  Should've seen their place.    Like animals
                  lived there.

                               RICHIE

                  It's been like this. I'm lucky I get
                  home before midnight; lots of careless-
                  ness.

     Richie regards Rivera's personal effects resting on his                 
     chest in a plastic bag: few bucks, the Corvette key, a half-
     empty packet of heroin in blue cellophane. Richie takes the
     blue cellophane from the bag and, as the drawer closes
     entombing Sanders, holds it in his hand ...

                  Since 1965, law enforcement has watched
                  its steady increase and with it a rise in
                  violent crime. Now unaccountably, it has
                  exploded, reaching into cities as a whole
                  - our suburbs and towns - our schools.

     INT. POLICE GYM - DAY

     The TV is in a small police gym where Richie lifts weights,
     very much aware of his pariah status as out-of-shape cops               
     come in, only to leave again when they see him.

                  But it's federal. I'd have to answer
                  to who? FBI?

                               TOBACK
                  Me and the U.S. Attorney. No one else.

                  his men with dope. Too much temptation
                  for the feeble-minded.

     Though he's not in much of a position to refuse the
     assignment, Richie still isn't convinced it's a good idea.
     Toback levels with him -

                  and it doesn't matter to anyone. Instead
                  of giving you a medal for turning in
                  money, they bury you.

                  Who's the beauty queen?

                               CHARLIE
                  She is a beauty queen.    No kidding.
                  Miss Puerto Rico.
     Her glance crosses Frank's briefly but is yanked to the
     entrance of the club when Frank's brothers come in with
     their wives and girlfriends. Teddy's in a parrot green
     suit, gold chains, hat, acting like he owns the place.

96   INT. BACK ROOM - SMALL'S PARADISE - LATER                        96

     Frank hustles Teddy into an empty back room.

                               FRANK
                  What is this?

     He turns Teddy so he's facing a mirror.

                               TEDDY
                  What. These are clothes.     This is a very
                  nice (suit) -

                               FRANK
                  I'm wearing clothes. These are clothes.
                  Those -
                         (Teddy's in the mirror)
                  - are a costume. With a sign on it that
                  says Arrest me. You look like fuckin
                  Jackie Fox.

                               TEDDY
                  What's wrong with Jackie.    I like Jackie.

                               FRANK
                  You like Jackie? You want to be
                  Superfly? Go work for him, end up in a
                  cell with him.

     Teddy pulls himself from Frank's grasp. Smooths his shirt,
     adjusts his hat. Frank tries to explain to him:

                               FRANK
                  The guy making all the noise in the room
                  is the weak one. That's not who you want
                  to be.

                               TEDDY
                  He wants to talk to you by the way.     I
                  told him I'd tell you.

     Frank stares at his brother's reflection in the mirror.

                               FRANK
                  You and Jackie were talking about me?

                               TEDDY
                  Not about you. We were talking. He said
                  he wanted to talk to you about something.

     Frank clearly wants nothing to do with Jackie Fox.

                               FRANK
                  I'm taking you shopping tomorrow.

                               TEDDY
                  I went shopping today.

                               FRANK
                  You go shopping every day.    Like a girl.

97   EXT. SMALL'S PARADISE - LATER - NIGHT                            97

     A creme Bentley pulls up and out pour Jackie Fox and his
     entourage.

                                                                    (CONT)

     He's got an armful of New York Times Magazines -with him on
     the cover, flaunting Gangster Chic. He starts handing them
     out to the crowd on his way into the club.

98   INT. SMALL'S PARADISE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                        98

     Joe Louis has come over to speak to Frank at his table.

                               JOE LOUIS
                  It's a tax thing. It's a mistake my
                  lawyers will straighten out, but for the
                  time being it's a headache -

                               FRANK
                  How much you owe?

                               JOE LOUIS
                  It's nothing, like - fifty grand.

     Frank isn't sure if it's an honor or a curse to have a
     celebrity like Joe Louis asking to borrow money, but nods.

                                FRANK
                  Sure.   Don't worry about it.

                                JOE LOUIS
                  Thank you.   I'll pay you back soon as -

                               FRANK
                  Joe. It's a gift. Not a loan.       You
                  don't owe me nothing.

     Jackie glides into the club with his magazines and
     entourage. Frank watches him make the rounds, lingering at
     Miss Puerto Rico's table and holding her hand longer than he
     should with his girlfriend on his arm. Frank glances to
     Teddy wearily, then to Doc, alone at the next table like a
     sentry. Frank doesn't have to say he's ready to leave. Doc
     knows the look. Gets up.

99   INT. SMALL'S PARADISE - LATER - NIGHT                             99

     Frank comes into the coat check area where Doc waits with
     his overcoat. As Frank slips into it, Miss Puerto Rico -
     returning from the ladies room - comes through.

                                ANA
                  Hi.   I'm Ana.

                               FRANK
                  I'm Frank.

                   You're Frank and this is your place.
                          (he doesn't say whether
                           it is or not)
                   Why's it called Small's? Why don't you
                   call it Frank's?

                                FRANK
                   Because I don't have to.

      He smiles, and it's hard to tell which is more enchanted
      with the other.

100   INT. NIGHTCLUB - NEWARK - SAME TIME - NIGHT                     100

      A club across the river. Not nearly as nice as Small's -
      much louder - but like Small's, almost all black. Richie
      shares a booth with a black undercover detective.

                                RICHIE
                   I'm reluctant to bring anyone in I
                   don't personally know.

                                SPEARMAN
                   You know me, and I vouch for them.

      Richie nods, Yeah, he knows that, but remains unconvinced.

                                SPEARMAN
                   Richie, we work together. You want me,
                   you got to take them, too.

                                RICHIE
                   Where are they?
      Spearman looks out across the crowded dance floor.

                                SPEARMAN
                   That's Jones. With the skinny white
                   woman.

      Richie's glance finds a young black man dancing wildly with
      his skinny white date.

                                SPEARMAN
                   That's Abruzzo, with the fat black one.

      Richie sees a young Italian with tatoos - the only other
      white man in the place - dancing with a heavy black woman.
      Both Jones and Abruzzo look more like criminals than cops.

                   Both are good with wires. Have good
                   informants. They're honest. And they're
                   fearless. They'll do anything. They're

101   INT. FRANK'S CAR - MOVING - NEW YORK - DAY                       101

      Frank sits in back alone. Peers ahead through the
      windshield. His face relaxes as he sees -

      Ana waiting on a corner, dressed nice, handbag.         The Towncar
      pulls to the curb.

                                FRANK
                   I got it.

      Frank gets out before Doc can, and escorts Ana to the car.

                                FRANK
                   I hope you weren't waiting long. A
                   woman as beautiful as you shouldn't have
                   to wait for anything.

      He opens the door for her like a perfect gentleman, slides
      in after her.

                   This is your father?

      Frank shakes his head no.       It's a picture of Bumpy.

                                FRANK
                   You really don't know who that is?
                          (she doesn't)
                   It's Martin Luther King.

                   It is not.

                                FRANK
                   You're right. He was as important as Dr.
                   King, though.

                   A lot of things. He had a lot of
                   friends. He served New York and it
                   served him.

                   What was he to you?

      Frank has to think.     Bumpy was more than his employer.

                   ... do it with love.

           A single, half-empty packet of heroin, the same one from the

           delinquent students. Of everyone in the open ground-floor

           Jones nudges Abruzzo to pay attention. Abruzzo elbows him

                   It's not true.                                           

107   INT/EXT. CAR / STREET - NEWARK - DAY                            107

      Abruzzo, looking like a junkie, dirty jeans, wool cap,
      approaches a dealer on the corner. The perspective shifts
      to Richie, Spearman and Jones in a car, watching as Abruzzo
      chats briefly with the dealer before the exchange takes
      place: $10 for a blue-cellophane packet.

108   INT. NARCOTICS SQUAD HQ - NEWARK - LATER - DAY                  108

      Richie and the others watch Jones tests the heroin.

                                JONES
                   Stuff's ten percent pure. Strong
                   enough to smoke for all those suburban
                   white kids afraid of needles.

      The other detectives are exchange a glance.       None has ever
      heard of anything on the street that pure.

                                RICHIE
                   You paid ten bucks for it?

                                JONES
                   And it's all that's out there.

                                RICHIE
                   Now, how is that possible? Who can
                   afford to sell shit twice as good for
                   half as much?
      Richie glances to a Table of Organization: Surveillance
      photos haphazardly thumb-tacked to a bulletin board - known
      dope men in the hierarchies of their individual crime
      families - almost all of them Italian.

      A poppy bulb being pierced, the white liquid oozing,
      changing into filthy liquids in wooden bowls, and finally
      a gray paste ...

      A tent: Nate hands more cash - the military brass's cut -
      to the 2-star general from before.

      An airstrip: Slicing propellers. Wounded soldiers on
      stretchers, helped onto a transport plane. Nearby, four
      large crates - Japanese TVs - under cargo netting. The
      pilot stuffs more cash in a pouch and salutes Nate.

115   EXT. ARMY BASE - NORTH CAROLINA - DUSK                       115

      The same plane on the tarmac here, taxiing. A pile of
      discarded TV boxes outside a supply warehouse.

      At the perimeter of the base, black servicemen transfer
      heavy taped-up duffel bags from an Army Jeep to a station
      wagon, hoisting those that won't fit inside onto a roof
      rack. Two Lucas brothers tie them down with twine.
116   INT/EXT. CAR / HIGHWAY - NEAR WASHINGTON DC - DUSK           116

      The station wagon heading north on a rain-slicked highway,
      the canvas tarpaulin on top flapping. In the distance, the
      spire of the Washington monument glows.

      Empty milk sugar boxes. Redtop and her five table workers
      - clothed now, the surgical masks dangling from their necks -
      wiping down table surfaces, scales and apparatus. Tens of
      thousands of blue-cellophane packets of heroin neatly cover
      two of the folding tables.

                                                                  51.
                            




119   EXT. HARLEM STREET - DAY                                     119

      August. Hot. Kids wrench open a fire hydrant and with an
      empty soda can direct the water into a fountain. The water
      sprays down onto the windshield of a beat-up Chevy coming
      slowly through, revealing when it clears, Frank behind the
      wheel. He parks. Glances at his watch.

120   INT. NYPD 23RD PRECINCT - LOCKER ROOM - DAY                  120

      Clock on the wall of a locker area: 3:58. Shift change.
      Cops in t-shirts. Fans blowing the humid air around.

121   INT/EXT. NYPD 23RD PRECINCT GARAGE - DAY                     121

      Blue and whites arriving and leaving, shirts coming off as

      bus up 8th Avenue.

123   INT/EXT. FRANK'S PARKED CHEVY - HARLEM - DAY                 123

      Air conditioner full blast. Radio announcing the time: 4
      o'clock. Frank glances out the wet windshield of the Chevy
      and watches 116th Street transform:

      It's as if an outdoor market has just opened its stalls.
      Junkies and dealers emerging from the alleys, storefronts,
      tenements and side streets - from the street itself it seems
      - snarling the cars and delivery trucks caught unaware.
      Small blue cellophane packets - and only blue - are pulled
      from pockets and change hands. In alleyways it's cooked up
      and sucked into syringes, and in dank, grim, indescribably
      filthy rooms, plunged into veins -

124   AND THE REVERSE:                                             124

      10 and 20 dollar bills changing hands - decks of cash
      rubber-banded together - put into envelopes and delivered
      to the Lucas brothers, to:

125   LESTER at his metal door shop.                               125

      Piles of cash.    The brothers try counting it all, but it's
      just too much.    It's actually tiring.

                                TEDDY
                   We're going to be here all night if we
                   count every bill.

      TIME CUT: A money-counting machine flips through the
      bills, its counter flying. The brothers rubberband it all
      in $100,000 decks. Jot down the numbers. Put the money
      in newly-assembled file boxes. Tape them shut.

131   INT. CHEMICAL BANK - SAFETY-DEPOSIT ROOM - DAY                   131

      Alone in the room, Frank transfers stacks of $100's from the
      file boxes into several open safety-deposit boxes.

132   INT. FRANK'S PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT                         132

      The penthouse is now richly decorated. The R & B music
      playing through a state-of-the-art stereo system. It's a
      kind of office party for Frank's brothers, cousins, wives
      and girlfriends, distributors like Rossi and other East
      Harlem guys, Charlie Williams, couple of cops on Frank's
      payroll, and the Chemical Bank Vice President.

                                BANKER
                   You got a stockbroker, Frank?

                                FRANK
                   I deal with enough crooks as it is.

      The banker jots down a name and phone number on the back of
      one of his business cards.

                                BANKER
                   This one couldn't be more honest. Ask
                   around. He's got a lot of clients in the
                   business. You can't leave all your money
                   in safety deposit boxes; give him a call.

      The banker hands him the card and moves on. Frank's trying
      to have a good time, but the level of noise and revelry is
      beginning to make him uncomfortable.

                                 CHARLIE
                   Frank.   This is Mike Sibota.

      Sibota tries not to look as nervous as he feels.

                   Mr. Sibota.   What can I get you?

                                SIBOTA
                   A left-hander from what Charlie tells me.
                   Your nephew?

      Frank points to his nephew, Stevie, across the room.

                                FRANK
                   It's been his dream all his life to play
                   for the Yankees - and he's good enough.

                                SIBOTA
                   So I hear. You have him come see me.
                   We'll give him a try-out.

      As the scout hands his card to Frank, we whip over to where
      Teddy, his driver Jimmy Racine and their girlfriends, coked
      up, are laughing as a black cop, flashing his detective's
      shield, pretends to frisk Jimmy.

                                DETECTIVE
                   What's this?
                          (taking a .45 from Jimmy's
                           pocket)
                   Oh, that's it, I'm taking you in.

                                JIMMY
                          (joking)
                   You can't take me in for that, I got       a
                   license for that, motherfucker.

                                DETECTIVE
                          (gives the gun back)
                   This then -
                          (the pile of coke on the
                           coffee table)
                   But first -

      The cop sucks up a line before pretending to cuff Jimmy.

                                DETECTIVE
                   All right, now I'm arresting you.

      Everybody laughs.    Teddy peels $100's from a money clip.

                                 TEDDY
                   Let him go.   This is for you.

                                DETECTIVE
                   What is that, a bribe?     Oh, now you're
                   all under arrest.

      The cop pretends to arrest them all, but what he doesn't
      pretend is the hand he puts on Jimmy's girlfriend's breast
      as he frisks her.

                                JIMMY
                   What is that?

      It was quick but Jimmy saw it, even though his girlfriend
      didn't react. The cop, oblivious, is cuffing Teddy now.

                                DETECTIVE
                   I'm taking you all in.

                                JIMMY
                   I said, what the fuck was that?

                                DETECTIVE
                   What was what?

      The room explodes with a boom and the detective crumples to
      the floor, clutching at his leg, blood running through his
      fingers onto the carpet. Frank stares.

                                JIMMY
                   Oh, he's all right. I just shot him in
                   the leg. You got a health plan, what are
                   you complaining about. He's fine. Here -
                          (peels off some money)
                   Five hundred all right? Six? Look, he's
                   feeling better all the time.

      Suddenly, Frank grabs Jimmy and throws him against the wall.

133   INT. FRANK'S PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT                        133
      As Ana tries to clean the blood stain on the rug with salt
      and soda water, Frank sits with his five brothers in the
      debris-strewn aftermath of the party. Silence before:

                   He doesn't feel shit, coked up all the

      Frank looks at Teddy in his tinted Jackie Fox-like goggle
      glasses - like he's going to straighten anybody out.

                   No, you're thinking of Benny the Bishop.
                   Benny Two-Socks is Tosca's deadbeat son-

      Richie comes over, studies the Table of Organization a                     
      moment, then begins untacking the photos from the top down -

      Richie and the Amigos observe a buy from a parked car, the
      blue cellophane changing hands. Ignoring the buyer as he
      walks away, they keep watching the seller.

      The seller is observed coming out of a mechanics garage.
      Richie ignores him as he walks away, watching instead the
      garage. Eventually, a mechanic wiping his hands on a rag
      steps out, and Richie raises a camera. The image of the
      mechanic - a supplier - freezes -

      Undercover in a wise guy's cashmere sweater and slacks,
      Richie watches the mechanic count the $10,000 he's given
      him.

                                RICHIE
                   It's got to be `Blue Magic.'

                   it up here tomorrow. Where's the rest of
                   the money?

                                RICHIE
                   That's half. I'll give you the other
                   half tomorrow when you give -

                                MECHANIC
                   No, no, no, I don't do that.    Go fuck
                   yourself.

      Richie rather reluctantly hands over the rest of the 20K.

143   INT/EXT. SPEARMAN'S CAR - MOVING - NEAR GW BRIDGE - DAY 143
      Spearman watches the pickup truck driven by the mechanic
      change lanes up ahead - heading for the George Washington
      Bridge - and glances over concerned to Richie, who is
      changing the cashmere sweater for an old t-shirt.

                                SPEARMAN
                   He's going into New York.   Are we?

                   They could. New York cops.     They can
                   do worse than that.

      As Spearman follows the truck, the George Washington Bridge,
      linking Jersey to Manhattan, looms in the windshield ...

144   EXT. EAST HARLEM STREET - DAY                                   144

      The pickup pulls to the curb outside a Pleasant Avenue
      grocery store. As the guy enters the place, Spearman's car
      stops long enough for Richie to climb out, and continues on.

      Richie crosses the street, tries to see who the guy is
      talking to inside, but he's just buying a cup of coffee to
      go. Spearman's car turns the corner to circle around the
      block. As soon as it's gone, the man emerges from the
      restaurant with the coffee and walks straight at Richie who
      has to double back quickly not to be seen

      Richie sees a delivery truck double-parked, guys unloading
      crates. Hears a horn and knows it's must be Spearman stuck
      on the side street. The mechanic starts his truck.
      Desperate not to lose him (and his money), Richie hurries               
      over to a taxi stopped at a light, flashes his badge.                   

                               RICHIE
                   Get out.

                               TAXI DRIVER
                   What?

                                RICHIE
                   Get the fuck out of the car!

      The driver realizes the man outside his taxi is crazy and
      tries to get his window rolled up. Reaching in, Richie gets
      his arm stuck, pulls at the lock, yanks the door open, drags
      the driver out, breaking the cabbie's arm, and jumps in.

      He swings the cab into opposing lanes to get around traffic,
      screeches around the corner, glimpses the truck far up ahead
      - guns the engine, flies through a red light, glances at his
      mirror at the cars that just missed him almost colliding -

      The truck turns up ahead, and Richie barrels through another
      red light, turns the corner and keeps the truck, a couple
      car-lengths ahead - in sight.

145   EXT. EAST HARLEM - DAY                                          145

      Richie curbs the cab as the guy goes into a dingy pizza
      parlor. Richie climbs out, crosses the street. Coming past
      the place, he tries to look inside without breaking stride.



                                                                     (CONT)

      From around a corner, striding toward him, come four men
      looking like Gestapo thugs in leather coats, manicured hair -
      the Princes of the City. Richie detours into an alley as
      they enter the restaurant.

      Richie peers in at the restaurant kitchen through a grimy
      basement window. Watches Trupo and his SIU detectives burst
      in, guns drawn. They rough everybody up, get some down on
      the floor. One detective gathers the money and stuffs it in
      a bag. Another gathers the dope. The mechanic tries to
      protest and Trupo slaps him down with his pistol.

      Richie keeps watching as the NY cops arrest no one - but
      take the dope and the money (Richie's money) - and stride
      out as abruptly as they appeared, like bandits. As they
      come past Richie -

                                RICHIE
                   That's my money.

                   The fuck are you. What money?

      Richie shows them his Bureau of Narcotics ID.                            

                                RICHIE
                   The bills are sequenced and registered
                   with the Essex County Prosecutors Office.
                   All begin with CF3500. Take a look.

      One of them checks some of the bills and sees he's right.

                                SIU DET. 2
                   Goddamn it, I thought we had a score.
                   I thought I had a fucking Chris-Craft
                   sitting in my driveway.

                                RICHIE

                                SIU DET. 1
                   This time.

      Three of the four cops laugh. It's an affable gang of
      thieves. The one who doesn't laugh hangs back as the others
      start off. He examines Richie's New Jersey ID.

                     Some of them will steal no matter what.                    
                     There can be a camera on them they'll do

        Richie - in robe and underwear - opens the door to find a                 
        woman in the hall holding a briefcase.

        He has no idea who the black woman is. An old girlfriend                  
        he's forgotten maybe. Behind him, Vida can see a stewardess               
        buttoning up her uniform by a little travel case on wheels.               
        The apartment itself, she can also see, is a mess.

156   EXT/INT. TONY ZACA'S BACKYARD & POOL HOUSE - DAY              156     

      Barbecue after their Sunday softball game. Richie and his
      O.C. friends - wise guys - still in their brown and orange
      Weequahie jerseys, drinking beer, cooking hamburgers.

                             TONY
                When you asked me to be your son's
                godfather, I took it very seriously.

                             RICHIE
                I know.

      Richie and Tony Zaca relax in the den-like pool house.

                             TONY
                I said yes, I'd take on this
                responsibility, take care of your son,
                God forbid something happened to you -

                             RICHIE
                Tony, the things she's telling Child
                Social Services make me look very bad:
                Out all night. Lowlife informants
                hanging around.   Women -

                             TONY
                Old friends like me.

      Richie feels horrible doing this.    Silence.   Then:

                             TONY
                It's all right. I understand. They
                ask me, I'll tell them what you want me
                to tell them. I'll lie for you.

                             RICHIE
                Thank you.

      Tony nods, You're welcome.    Can tell there's something else
      on Richie's mind.

                             TONY
                What.

                             RICHIE
                You don't have to talk about it, you
                don't want. What do you hear about Blue
                Magic? Anything?

                             TONY
                A lot of sorrow and misery from guys
                being put out of business. That's all.

                                RICHIE
                   Nothing about who's bringing it in?

                                TONY
                   Guys down south is all I heard.

                                RICHIE
                   Down south, Florida?   Cubans?   What.

                                TONY
                   I don't know. All I can tell you is
                   whoever it is, they're upsetting the
                   natural order of things.

      Among the framed family photos around them, is a picture
      of Tony's uncle, Albert Tosca.

157   EXT. LIVINGSTON, NEW JERSEY - DAY                               157

      A Napoleonic statue of the same man on horseback in a
      fountain outside a castle-like mansion. Next to it "ride"
      three others on marble horses - a woman and two children.

                   Pull -

      A clay pigeon sails out across the manicured garden. A
      shotgun blast shatters it. The man with the gun - Albert
      Tosca - hands another to Frank. As Frank sets to shoot, Ana
      can seen behind them, with Tosca's wife in the opulent
      house, looking uncomfortable.

                                MRS. TOSCA
                   The whole place was imported brick by
                   brick from Gloucestershire.

                                ANA
                   It's very nice.

      Mrs. Tosca nods. Ana nods. A strained silence thicker than
      the tapestries settles over them until -

                               FRANK
                   Pull -

      The shotgun booms -

      As servants stand by, Tosca and his wife and their only
      guests - Frank and Ana - finished with lunch, get up from
      the table in the formal Formal dining room.

                                                                     (CONT)

      As Mrs. Tosca leads Ana off to give her a tour of the house,
      the men head off the other way.

                                TOSCA
                   She's a lovely girl.    You should marry
                   her.

                                FRANK
                   Too many things to look after right now
                   to think about that.

                                TOSCA
                   Frank. That's a mistake. If I may say.
                   Don't take her for granted, girl like
                   that.

      They enter a rich, wood-paneled study lined with books.

                                TOSCA
                   You interested in history, Frank? The
                   events that have brought us to where we
                   are today? You know who was? Bumpy.

                                FRANK
                   Bumpy was interested in a lot of things.

                                TOSCA
                   I always wonder if people know when
                   history's being made. And what they're
                   doing at the time. This, for instance,
                   could be a historic moment, and you're
                   sipping a glass of ice water.

      Droplets snake down Frank's glass. He senses Tosca has
      finally gotten around to why he was invited here.
                                TOSCA
                   Bumpy and I did a lot of business
                   together, as you know. Whatever he
                   needed, he'd come to me and I'd do my
                   best to provide it. He came to me, I
                   didn't go to him, is the point I'm trying
                   to make. You know why?

                                FRANK
                   He didn't have what you needed. You had
                   what he needed. We've always had to come
                   to you.

                                 TOSCA
                   Yes.   Until now.

      Tosca studies Frank, who is a study in inscrutability.

                                                                      (CONT)

                                TOSCA
                   Monopolies are illegal in this country,
                   Frank, because no one can compete with a
                   monopoly. If they let the dairy farmers
                   do that, half of them would go out of
                   business tomorrow.

                                FRANK
                   I'm just trying to make a living.

                                TOSCA
                   Which is your right. Because this is
                   America. But not at the unreasonable
                   expense of others. That's un-American.
                          (he studies Frank)
                   You know the price you pay for a gallon
                   of milk doesn't represent its true cost
                   of production. It's controlled. Set.

                                FRANK
                   I set a price I think is fair.

                                TOSCA
                   It's very unfair, in fact. Your
                   customers are happy, but what about your
                   fellow dairy farmers? You're not
                   thinking of them.

                                FRANK
                          (very calmly)
                   I'm thinking of them as much as they ever
                   thought of me.

                                TOSCA
                   All right. I can see you're getting
                   excited. Don't get excited. That's not
                   why I invited you to my home. To get
                   excited.

      Frank doesn't look excited at all. He's the picture of
      calm. Tosca smiles benignly and gets up.

                                TOSCA
                   Here, I got something for you.

                   I don't need it. I already got
                   everything from 110th Street to Yankee
                   Stadium, river to river.

                                TOSCA
                   Which is a little mom and pop store
                   compared to what I'm talking about. I
                   could make you bigger than K-Mart. L.A.,
                   Chicago, Detroit, Vegas. I'm speaking
                   nationwide. And I'd guarantee you peace
                   of mind. You know what I mean by that.

      Frank does. It's a backhanded threat.        Tosca clips the
      cigars with a gold guillotine

                                TOSCA
                   Frank. You can see I'm a Renaissance
                   man. Unfortunately not all my people are
                   as enlightened. Ask them, What is civil
                   rights, they don't know. They're not as
                   open to change from the way things are
                   done and who's doing it. But I can talk
                   to them so there won't be any
                   misunderstanding. That's what I mean by
                   peace of mind.

      Frank knows, in truth, he's not being given any choice in
      this matter. Still, maybe it's not so bad.

                                FRANK
                   You pay what a kilo now, 75, 80? I'd
                   consider 50. And I can get you as much
                   as you want.
      Tosca slips on his best poker face. Fifty thousand a kilo
      would be an extraordinary coup for him.

                                TOSCA
                   You see, I was right. This is a
                   historic moment. You're going to be
                   bigger than Bumpy himself.

      He hands Frank one of the cigars, expertly prepared.

                                TOSCA
                   Can't smoke it here, unfortunately.
                   Grace doesn't like it. Take it with you.

                                                                   67.

      Doc waits by the car as Frank and Ana walk toward him.
      The Toscas wave goodbye from the front step of the mansion.
      Frank slips the cigar into his top pocket as they climb in.

                             ANA
                Why would you trust these people, the way
                they look at you?

                             FRANK
                They look at me like it's Christmas and
                I'm Santa Claus.

                             ANA
                They looked at us like we're the help.

                              FRANK
                        (kisses her cheek)
                No.   They're working for me now.

161   INT. NARCOTICS SQUAD HQ - NEWARK - DAY                        161

      A TV: Muhammad Ali, the black man's black man, and Joe
      Frazier, the white man's black man, at their 1971 Madison
      Square Garden press conference where Ali says as much.

      Most of the guys watching it. Richie isn't. He comes
      over to Table of Organization. Tacks his Bar Association
      notice to it. Regards the photographs, like tentacles of
      octopus yet to have a head.

      Only the lowest section is made up of blacks (including
      Charlie Williams and Jackie Fox, but not Frank Lucas). The
      rest of the faces are white and stop about midway up.
      They've hit a wall they can't get past.

      Another TV here: Howard Cosell, ringside at the Garden as
      the first early fans arrive, pointing out that the fight,
      because of the political stand Ali's taken, is less about
      boxers than war versus anti-war.

      Frank chooses a linen jacket from his extensive color-
      coordinated racks of Phil Cromfeld suits as Ana, in her
      lingerie, puts on make-up at a vanity. He comes up behind
      her and sets down a small jewelry box.

           Ana's reflection in the vanity mirror as Frank slips the
           engagement ring on her finger. She wipes at a tear, then
           gets up and hugs him.

                                      ANA
                        Yes.

           She kisses him.     Admires the ring.     And -

                                     ANA
                        I bought you something, too.

           She crosses past the TV, takes a garment bag down from her
           side of the closet, lays it on the bed next to Frank's suit
           jacket. She takes hold of the zipper but doesn't
           immediately pull it, hoping perhaps to create some dramatic
           tension.

                                      FRANK
                        What is it?

           She unzips the bag like she's unveiling great art. But
           instead of seeing what's inside, we're allowed only Frank's
           reaction: his smile of anticipation slowly changing to
           chagrin.

166        INT/EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - BACK ENTRANCE - NIGHT            166

           Richie observes celebrities and gangsters arriving in
           limousines - Sammy Davis Jr. and his wife, Joe Louis and
           his, Tosca and some of his guys - then enters the arena as
           another limo pulls up. Ana climbs out.

                                     ANA
                        Come on. You look great.
                               (no one else emerges)
                        You want to miss the fight? Come on.

           Finally, a patent leather shoe pokes out, sets down on the
           curb. Then its mate beside it. The shoes step away from
           the limo and -

           Pre-fight. Richie, blended in with the a group of press
           photographers, regards the organized crime figures ringside.
           He takes a few pictures with the long lens camera as -

      The owner of the gleaming patent leather shoes is shown to
      his second row ringside seat just behind the sports writers,
      and we move up the full-length chinchilla coat to Frank's
      uneasy expression -

      Richie's camera roams the faces of the prime ticket holders
      ringside: organized crime figures, celebrities, politicians,              
      women with plunging necklines and platinum hair -                         

                                 JOE LOUIS

      Richie can't believe it's Joe Louis brushing past him -                   

                                 RICHIE

      Joe looks back as Richie approaches him -

                   I'm sorry, but I just have to tell you,                      
                   sir, you were a hero to me growing up. I                     
                   still push elevator buttons eight times

      Louis acknowledges Richie only slightly more than not at                  
      all. Turns away to join his friends. Richie watches after                 
      him, stung by Louis's disregard.                                          

      He snaps a picture of an Italian wise guy he doesn't                      
      recognize ... sifts the camera's view past Frank in the                   
      chinchilla coat ... then returns to him, watches as Tosca                 
      and his guys sit down behind Frank. Richie can't hear -                   
      but can see - their good-natured exchange -

                                TOSCA
                   Hey, Frank, you keep that hat on, I'm
                   gonna miss the fight -

      The odd thing to Richie is, Chinchilla's seat is better
      than all the Italians'. Detective Trupo notices this, too.
      Richie focuses on the Chincilla's date, a stunning girl, a
      beauty queen, then shifts back to her boyfriend who's now
      shaking the proffered hands of other Italians, then Don
      King. Joe Louis himself - who barely acknowledged Richie's                
      existence - comes over and playfully exchanges "punches"                  
      with the man in the chinchilla coat.

      A sudden roar from the crowd as the lights go out except
      for the spot on the ring. Ali and Frazier are coming down
      the steps through the crush of fans and reporters, preceded
      by soldiers carrying flags -
                                                                       (CONT)

      Richie tries to find the guy in the chinchilla coat, but
      he's hidden by a flag. Then he glimpses him again just as
      Ali shakes his hand before climbing into the ring -

      Flashbulbs pop throughout the arena as Robert Goulet
      begins the National Anthem. Ali pointedly doesn't sing
      along. Richie frames the shadowy figure in the chinchilla
      coat, focuses as sharp as he can in the bad light, and
      snaps the shutter -

      Richie tacks the photograph of the man in the chinchilla
      coat to his Table of Organization - low and off to the side
      by other pieces of the puzzle that don't fit, other new
      faces with no names. Spearman holds a scrap of paper -

                   He's a supplier at most. Or just a pimp.
                   We'd've heard of him otherwise.

                                RICHIE
                   No, he's bigger than that. His seats                       
                   were phenomenal; better than Al Tosca's.                   
                   Joe Louis and Ali shook his fuckin hand.                   

      They look from Tosca's high position on the board to Frank's
      low one, and a wedding march played in traditional fashion
      on organ begins and carries over:

           Ana, in turn, puts a gold band on Frank's. The minister

                Richie. Newark just picked up one of the
                celebrities on our Wall of Fame: Teddy's
                driver. For attempted murder.

205   INT. NARCOTICS SQUAD HQ - NEWARK - NIGHT                      205

      Richie's had Jimmy Racine brought over. Sits with him as
      the Three Amigos watch from the shadows. Just coming off
      his high, and the attempted murder, Jimmy looks disoriented
      as he sits in cuffs in the dungeon-like basement.

                             RICHIE
                Because it's an attempted homicide,
                that's Grand Jury. Now, that Grand Jury
                could come in very favorably. Might turn
                out to be Attempted Manslaughter. Self
                Defense even. She had a knife. Depends
                on how I want to deal with you. You see
                where this is going.

      Jimmy looks around at the basement dungeon with concern.

                             JIMMY
                The fuck is this place?

                             RICHIE
                Let's say you beat it somehow. What do
                you think Cousin Frank'll think of that?
                He knows you had to sit here listening to
                something like this. And then you beat
                an attempted murder? Is he stupid?
                He'll assume you talked.

      Jimmy can easily imagine that scenario and it frightens him.


                                                                   (CONT)

                                RICHIE
                   You fucked up, Jimmy. But nobody knows.
                   Frank doesn't know. Yet. Do you want him
                   to read about it in the paper? Or do you
                   want to walk out of here - no bail, no
                   trial - just walk out, now.

206   EXT. NARCOTICS SQUAD HQ - NEWARK - DAWN                          206

      Jimmy has thought about it all night and walks out of the
      building into the chilly morning air.

                                 RICHIE V/O
                   Jimmy?   Look at me -

      Jimmy looks over his shoulder as if Richie just called to
      him from it, which he didn't. There's no one in sight -

                                RICHIE V/O
                   Any time I want to change my mind? I
                   don't like the quality of your work? I
                   can find a witness saw you shoot your
                   girlfriend. It just took me a while. I
                   even know what he'll look like. He'll
                   look just like you.

207   EXT. MEAT PACKING DISTRICT - DAY                                 207

      Teddy's car comes around a corner and down the street.

208   INT. TEDDY'S CAR - MOVING - DAY                                  208

      Jimmy Racine, wired, looks in the rear view mirror at Teddy
      in the back seat, and, behind him, Richie's car following.
209   INT. RICHIE'S CAR - SAME TIME                                    209

      Richie keeps Teddy's car in view ahead. Glances in his
      mirror at the cars following him. His detectives.

210   EXT. MEAT PACKING DISTRICT - LATER - DAY                         210

      The detectives' cars parked behind a warehouse. Richie
      peers into binoculars at: Teddy's car parked by Frank's
      outside another warehouse loading dock. Frank gets out,
      discusses something with his brother, comes past Jimmy to
      some men in bloody white coats.

      He talks to them, returns to his car, takes a valise from
      the trunk. He snaps it open revealing stacks of cash, hands
      it over and walks to a semi-truck, glancing once in Richie's
      direction. Though he can't see anyone there he gives a wave
      to them - or is it to the truck driver to pull out -

                                                                   80.
                             




211    EXT. HARLEM STREET - DAY                                     211

       Like Bumpy used to do every Thanksgiving, Frank and his
       brothers, from the back of the truck, hand out hundreds of
       freshly-butchered turkeys to the poor.

212    INT. MAMA LUCAS'S TEANECK, N.J. HOUSE - DAY                  212

       Frank, in an apron, carries in a huge cooked turkey as the
       extended Lucas family gathers around the table. It's like
       Norman Rockwell painting -

213    INT/EXT. ALLEY / ROOMS HARLEM - SAME TIME - DAY              213

       Another Thanksgiving picture: addicts shooting up and
       nodding out in alleys and dingy rooms. Tight on needles,
       veins, spoons, filth -

214    INT. RICHIE'S APARTMENT - SAME TIME - DAY                    214

       Richie alone at his kitchen table with a sandwich and a
       beer. The Macy's parade plays silently on his TV.

A215   INT/EXT. TRUPO'S HOUSE - SAME TIME - DAY                    A215

       A doorbell summons Trupo. He comes through his entry.
       Opens the front door. Finds no one there - except a large
       live turkey on the doorstep. He stares at it nonplussed,
       then looks up to a sound - a whoosh - as flames engulf the
       interior and spit out the windows of his Shelby Mustang ...

B215   INT. MAMA LUCAS'S TEANECK, N.J. HOUSE - DAY                 B215

       The big knife in Frank's hand slices into the turkey and
       lifts meat onto a plate that's passed from hand to hand, the
       family engaged in several conversations at once, laughing -

215    INT. MAMA LUCAS'S TEANECK, N.J. HOUSE - DAY                  215

       Bathroom. Jimmy Racine, shirt off, wired, changes the
       batteries of the little tape recorder.

216    EXT. MAMA LUCAS'S TEANECK, N.J. HOUSE - DAY                  216

       Jimmy comes out, tries to take a chair not too far from
       Frank who's watching his nephew toss pop-up flies for the
       younger kids to catch.

                              FRANK

                   You're     too busy to meet with Billy
                   Martin?   After I set it up?

      Stevie shifts around, not wanting to make Frank mad ...

                                STEVIE
                   I don't want to play pro ball, I decided.

                                  FRANK
                   What're you   talking about? This is your
                   dream since   you were their age -
                          (the   younger kids)
                   Maybe I can   set it up again.

      Stevie just stands there, uncomfortable.         Finally -

                                STEVIE
                   It's not what I want. I want to do what
                   you do, Uncle Frank. I want to be you.

      Frank stares at him unhappily.       Teddy comes over but Frank
      barely notices.

                                TEDDY
                   We got a problem.

      Jimmy Racine behind the wheel.       Frank and Teddy in back,
      speaking quietly.

                                TEDDY
                   He's been cutting it so much it's down
                   to two, three percent pure.
                                FRANK
                   You tested it. You're sure.

      Teddy nods. Frank notices Jimmy looking at them in the rear
      view mirror.

                                FRANK
                   The fuck you looking at?

      The car pulls up in front of a building in the clothing
      district. Jimmy stays while Teddy and Frank go inside.

                                                                   82.

      Jackie's club looks like a set from a blaxploitation film.
      Frank and Teddy, led by a bodyguard, come past some turkey
      carcasses and other remnants of Thanksgiving to where Jackie
      and a couple friends cavort with some naked girls.

                              JACKIE
                Frank.   Welcome.

                             FRANK
                We need to talk.

                              JACKIE
                Great.   Girls, get out.

      The girls gather their things and leave. Frank wipes at a
      modern leather chair with his handkerchief, throws it away,
      sits. Jackie lays out a couple lines, offers Frank a rolled
      up hundred dollar straw. Frank shakes his head, no thanks.

                             JACKIE
                You talked to Charlie. You want to hear
                more about my Black Coalition. Let me
                explain it to you -

      But first, let me suck up a line of coke -

                             FRANK
                That's not why I'm here.
                       (Jackie glances up from the
                        powder. No?)
                Everybody's happy, Jackie. Charlie, Baz,
                the cops, the Italians, everybody.
                Everybody except you.

                             JACKIE
                I'm happy.

                             FRANK
                Then I don't understand. Why do you have
                to take something that's perfectly good
                the way it is, and wreck it?

      Jackie doesn't seem to understand.

                             FRANK
                Brand names mean something, Jackie.
                Consumers rely on them to know what
                they're getting. They know the company
                isn't going to try to fool them with an
                inferior product. They buy a Ford, they
                know they're gonna get a Ford.

                          (his look says, right?)
                   Blue Magic is a brand name; as much a

                   behind it. I guarantee it and people
                   know that even if they don't know me any
                   more than they know the chairman of

                   concerned, when you chop my dope down to
                   five percent, is trademark infringement.

      That.   That's what this is about.      Jackie nods, but -

                                JACKIE
                   With all due respect, Frank, if I buy
                   something, I can do whatever I want with
                   it.

                                FRANK
                   That's not true. That's where you're
                   wrong.

                                JACKIE
                   If I buy a car, I can paint it, God damn
                   it.

                                FRANK
                   Jackie, you don't need to. You don't
                   need to make more money than you can with
                   Blue the way it is. No one does. At a
                   certain point it's just greed.

                                JACKIE
                   What do you want, Frank?    You want me to

                                FRANK
                   I have to insist. You call it Blue
                   Magic, that's misrepresentation.

                                JACKIE
                   Fine. I'll call it Red Magic, even
                   though it doesn't sound as good.

      They emerge from the building to where Jimmy waits.

                                TEDDY
                   Give me the keys; take a cab home.

      Frank and Teddy driving in silence.        Eventually -

                                FRANK
                   You don't go over there any more.

      Teddy doesn't like it, but nods. Suddenly his face is
      illuminated by light reflecting in the rear view mirror, an
      unmarked police car behind them, flashing its brights.

                                FRANK
                   It's all right, pull over, what are they
                   going to do? Give us a ticket?

      But Teddy isn't as calm as he begins to pull over.

                                                                     85.
                               




223   EXT. GARMENT WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NY - LATE AFTERNOON           223

      As Trupo and his partner climb out of their car and approach
      Teddy's -

                              TEDDY
                Frank?   Some of it's in the trunk.

      Frank regards him with utter disbelief. Teddy shies as if
      he expects to get hit. The SIU detectives arrive.

                             TRUPO
                Hello, Frank.

                             FRANK
                Detective. How's it going?        You have a
                nice Thanksgiving?

                             TRUPO
                I did not, as a matter of fact.       Get out
                of the car.

      The Lucases climb out.

                             FRANK
                Where's the Shelby?

                             TRUPO
                The Shelby's gone, Frank.

      Trupo reaches in the driver's side window, takes the keys
      from the ignition and comes around to the trunk. Frank and
      Teddy exchange a glance as it opens. Silence. Then -
                             TRUPO
                Want to come over here a minute, Frank?

      Six kilos of heroin are illuminated by the trunk light.
      Frank and Trupo regard it in silence. Then -

                             TRUPO
                Now what are we gonna do about this?

                             FRANK
                We're gonna shut the trunk and say good
                night, forget you pulled us over.

                             TRUPO
                I got a better idea.

      Trupo reaches into the trunk, picks up two of the heroin
      bricks, tucks them under his arm and looks at Frank -

                                                                     (CONT)

                                 TRUPO
                    Or would you rather I took it all and
                    threw you and your brother in the fuckin
                    river?

                                 FRANK
                    I don't know, would you rather it's your
                    fuckin house blows up next time?

       They hold each others' stare for a long moment.

                                 TRUPO
                    I loved that car.

                                    FRANK
                    I know.

       Trupo closes the trunk and walks away with his cut of the
       heroin, calling to his partner -

                                    TRUPO
                    Let's go.

       As the SIU cops walk to their car, the perspective shifts,
       through binoculars: Richie watching.

A224   INT. TEDDY'S CAR / STREET - LATER - NIGHT                          A224

       From outside the driver's side, Teddy's head, inside the
       car, suddenly smashes against the window, cracking it. His
       groan is interrupted by Frank's muffled voice -

                                 FRANK
                    Don't you ever put me in a car with dope
                    in it.

224    INT. RICHIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                     224

       Richie comes in, opens the fridge and stares in, his mind
       elsewhere. A ringing phone pulls him out of it.

                                    RICHIE
                    Yeah.   Tony.    How's it going?

       Tony's wife and daughters can be seen in the suburban
       backyard. Here in the kitchen Tony and Richie watch kernels                 
       of popcorn bounce off the inside walls of the first Amana                   
       microwave oven. It's noisier than modern ones.

                   It's a scientific force like atomic                          
                   energy. It rearranges the molecules.

                   want to put your head in there.                              

      Tony rakes out the plain, `pre-microwaveable' popcorn,                    
      using his hand. Gives some to Richie. Half of it's burnt.

      Tony hands Richie some snapshots: The Zaca family on the                  
      slopes of a resort, and in and outside a beautiful snow-
      dotted cabin.

                   Know who we met? Burt Reynolds. I'm not
                   kidding. Lot of people from Hollywood go
                   up there now, buying up everything.

                   sauna, everything. We were guests.
                          (pause)
                   No ... No, that's your place.

      Everything seems to stop. Richie becomes aware of the
      sounds around them, the girls splashing around outside ...

                   Isn't there something we can do - about
                   leaving the big guy alone? You know who
                   I mean.

      What Richie knows is that no matter what he does or says at
      this point he's got a problem.

                   If I don't report what you just said
                   to me, you know I could be in a lot of
                   trouble. If I do, then it's you.

      Richie considers the room itself, measuring the odds of
      microphones and a recorder being in it somewhere.

        Alone in the empty building, he stares at the T.O.: The
        higher echelon Italians like Tosca; lower echelon Harlem
        guys like Charlie Williams and Frank Lucas.

        He gets up then, untacks Frank's photograph from its lowly
        position and moves it to a place no black has ever occupied -
        to the top of the pyramid - above the mafia.

        Richie and Tobacke regard the two stone-faced FBI agents -

                               RICHIE
                  Who took it out?
                         (nothing from the agents)
                  If there's a contract on me, it would be
                  nice to know who took it out.

                                 FBI AGENT
                    We can't say without compromising our
                    source. You understand.

                                   RICHIE
                    No.    I don't. Not when it's my life.

                                 FBI AGENT
                    If you want, we can assign someone to
                    you.

                    Who?    FBI?   You're going to protect me?

       Richie almost laughs at the thought, looks to Toback.             In
       fact, none of this is funny.

C231   EXT. STREET - NEWARK - NIGHT                                      C231

       Walking toward his apartment down its dark street, bag of
       groceries in arm, Richie becomes aware someone is following
       him. He slows to let the figure get closer, closer, then
       turns fast, drops the guy and puts a gun to his head.

                                   MAN
                    Don't shoot!    For God's sake.

       Richie keeps the gun pressed against the guy's forehead.

                                   RICHIE
                    Talk.

       Richie and Laurie sit with their respective lawyers, waiting

                    Laurie. I'm sorry I couldn't give you
                    the kind of life you wanted. I'm sorry
                    it was never enough. But don't punish me
                    for being honest. Don't take my son
                    away.

       She stares at him in disbelief.        Then responds in a louder
       voice than his -

                   What are you saying? That because you
                   were "honest" and didn't take money like
                   every other cop, I left you?

      The bailiff looks over, but she doesn't care.

                                LAURIE
                   You don't take money for one reason:
                   to buy being dishonest about everything
                   else. And that's worse than taking money
                   nobody gives a shit about - drug money,
                   gambling money nobody's gonna miss.
                          (more people look over)
                   I'd rather you took it and been honest
                   with me. Or don't take it, I don't care.
                   But don't then go cheat on me. Don't
                   cheat on your kid by never being around.
                   Don't go out and get laid by your
                   snitches and secretaries and strippers.
                   I can tell just by looking, she's one
                   of them.

                   your "honest." You're not. You're going

                   Your honor, a lot has been said here
                   today about how unsavory Mr. Roberts'
                   environment is for a child. How
                   dangerous it is. I'm sorry, but this is
                   our world. This is where we live and we
                   tell him, Protect us. We give him that
                   responsibility, and then say, Oh, but we
                   don't trust you to raise a child. We
                   don't think you're fit for that.

           Silence. Sheila looks at him, but he's looking at Laurie,
           and speaks to her like they're alone in the room:

           Doc pulls to the curb outside Frank's building. As the

           roof of the car, Frank crosses to Trupo's car with a couple
           of bottles of Crystal tied with holiday bows.

      Ana hangs tinsel on the tree as Frank gives the shepherd
      some dog toy presents he's bought. More to himself:

                   Bumpy hardly ever went out at a certain
                   point. He stayed in - read - watched TV -
                   played chess. I thought he chose to lead
                   a quiet life. He didn't. He couldn't go
                   out without something happening.

                                ANA
                   We can still go out.

                   Where? With who? Everyone I know is
                   under surveillance. I can't even be with
                   my family at Christmas anymore.

      He gets up, pets the dog, and looks out the window at
      Christmas angels stretched across the street, at people on
      the sidewalk, wondering perhaps which of them are undercover
      cops, at Trupo's car, still parked outside.

                                ANA
                   Why don't you just pay who you have to

                   doesn't matter. It doesn't satisfy them.

                        Doc's got the keys.   Let's go back.

                                     FRANK
                        I'm not leaving you on the street.

                                     ANA
                        Get the keys, Frank, it's cold.

           He starts back through cascading snow.       Notices a car coming
           slowly down the street -

246        INT. CHINESE PLACE - CONTINUED                                  246

           The cook dumps sizzling vegetables into a take-out container
           and puts it in a bag -

         The car passes, continues to the end of the block, turns the
         corner.

           Doc hands over money, waits for his change -

           Frank sees the car again, coming around the corner, walks
           briskly back to where Ana waits. The car is almost upon
           them as he grabs her by the wrist and pulls her hard along
           the sidewalk. The car guns its engine -

           As Frank pushes in past the doors with Ana, the windows
           explode. They dive to the floor, bullets ripping through
           the place.

           Doc draws his two guns and fires back at the car, hitting
           it a couple times as it screeches off. He gathers Ana and
           Frank off the floor like a presidential bodyguard, hustles
           them out to the car. Frank's shoulder is bleeding.

                                  DOC

           Heavy security in the hallways: Frank's own men and some
           cops he's got on the payroll. Ana steps from the elevator
           and hurries past, early edition New York paper in hand.

255        INT. FRANK'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT                               255

           The brothers watch as a private doctor attends Frank's
           wounds. He seems all right fine except for the fact that
           someone had the fucking nerve to take a shot at him - and
           Charlie he sees in the newspaper - gunned down, dead, lurid
           Weegee-like photo of him on the front page.

      She pulls a drawer open. Takes out their passports.
      Begins packing. The brothers watch, not sure what to do,
      or say. To them -

                                 FRANK
                   Go home.   Go see your kids.

      He obviously wants to talk to Ana alone. Pulls away from
      the doctor. They all leave. Ana keeps packing.

                                FRANK
                   What are you doing?     Where've you been?

        He grabs her and holds her to calm her down.

                                   FRANK
                     Shhh.   Come on, now.   Shhh.

        He holds her close, waits for her breathing to slow before:

                                  FRANK
                     Where are we going to go? Spain?

                     We can run and hide is what you're
                     saying.

        He slowly shakes his head: that's something he'll never do.

                     Said he'll only talk to you.

                    From what I hear, it was the Corsicans.
                    The French Connection, Fernando Rey, the
                    exporters Frank has put out of business.
                    Now, I can take care of him in New York,
                    but I don't want to have to worry every
                    time he drives across the bridge to
                    Jersey someone's gonna take another shot
                    at him.

       Richie gives nothing away even as it stuns him that Trupo
       would speak to him this blatantly.

                                 TRUPO
                    We need to start working together. We
                    need to step up our efforts. Next time
                    their aim could be better. We need to
                    keep this cash cow alive.

       Jimmy Racine comes in - sees Trupo - and leaves - but not
       before Trupo has seen him. And now he sees the Lucas Table
       of Organization he didn't notice when he came in. Gets up
       and walks over to it now and takes a closer look. Sees
       Frank's picture at the top, like Enemy Number 1.

                                 TRUPO
                    Jesus. What the fuck you doing here?
                    You actually going to arrest Frank Lucas?
                    What's the matter with you?

                                 RICHIE
                    I'm crazy. Can't you tell that? I'm
                    crazy enough to shoot someone and make it
                    look like an accident next time he comes
                    over the bridge without my permission.
                    Get the fuck out of New Jersey.

       They regard each other a moment before Trupo turns to leave.

                    I don't know that it was any of them,

                    Then maybe I'll kill them all just to
                    make a fuckin point.

       Tosca seems more philosophical about it - like Bumpy might
       have been - but it wasn't him who was shot at.

                    You want to know who it was? I can
                    tell you. It was a junkie. Or a rival.
                    Or some dumb ass kid trying to make a
                    name for himself. Or someone you forgot
                    to pay off. Or slighted without
                    realizing it. Or someone you put out of
                    business by being too successful.
                           (pause)
                    Success has a lot of enemies. Your
                    success is who took a shot at you. How
                    you gonna kill it? By being
                    unsuccessful? You can be successful and
                    have enemies, or unsuccessful and have
                    friends. It's the choice we make.

                   Just like that? We're going to leave the
                   fuckin country to the communists?

      Frank and Nate and their "army" of black servicemen and Thai
      thugs wind through the jungle with pack mules.                         

268   INT. BAMBOO DWELLING - OPIUM FARM - DAY                          268

      The same farm and hut as before. Frank and the Chinese
      General sip tea. The four million dollars in cash Frank
      brought sits on the table.

                                GENERAL
                   Opium plants are hearty enough to
                   outlive any war. They'll still be here
                   long after the troops are gone. But what
                   are you going to do for transportation
                   when the last US plane goes home?

                                FRANK
                   I'll figure something out.      You'll see
                   me again.
      The General seems fond of Frank, and not only because of all
      the money on the table.

                                GENERAL
                   It's not in my best interest to say
                   this, Frank ... but quitting while you're
                   ahead is not the same as quitting.

                                FRANK
                   That's what my wife thinks.

                                GENERAL
                   But you don't think she's right.

      Frank doesn't say.

                                                                     102.
                               




269    EXT. OPIUM FARM - DAY                                           269

       Mules are loaded up with burlap bags containing 3,000 kilos
       of heroin.

A270   EXT. OPIUM FARM / JUNGLE - DAY                                 A270

       The mule train approaches the jungle that surrounds the
       opium farm. Nate's Thai thugs, left behind in sniper
       positions in the trees, stand ready to open fire if they
       have to as Frank, Nate, the soldiers and mules pass below.

B270   EXT. JUNGLE - LATER - DAY                                      B270

       They seem to have made it, winding back down through the
       jungle with the mules. Suddenly a barrage of gunfire erupts
       from the trees - a couple of Nate's men are hit as the rest
       dive for cover, shouting "Vietcong," and returning the fire.
       Frank drops down from his mule, gets a pistol out and shoots
       into the trees. Bullet-severed palm fronds rain down.

                              FRANK
                 Give them half!

       Nate, pinned down by the mules, can't hear him over the
       noise.

                              FRANK
                 Cut half of them loose!      The mules!

       Nate cuts the mule-train tether in the middle, slaps at the
       animals. As the freed mules disappear into a wall of trees
       the shooting subsides, then stops altogether. Smoke from
       all the gunfire rises like mist around the half dozen Thais
       and Americans lying dead on the ground.

      The army captain regards the detective for a long moment.

                                RICHIE
                   The warrant permits me to search the
                   plane and its cargo.

      The captain doesn't comply. Richie moves to open the coffin
      himself and every soldier's shouldered rifle immediately
      comes into firing position, aimed at him.

                                ARMY CAPTAIN
                   But you don't have my permission.

      Richie stares at the weapons and the uniformed men holding
      them, safeties off, fingers on the triggers; all they're
      waiting for is their commander's order to fire.

                                RICHIE
                   I don't need it.

      Trupo regards the shepherd snarling at him from behind the
      kennel fence. Comes around back. Pushes at the frame. It
      moves a little, like it's levered -

      With the rifles still pointed at him, Richie kneels down,
      pulls the latches of the coffins, half expecting to hear an
      accompanying barrage of gunfire. He lifts the lid. Sees a
      long black body bag inside -

295   EXT. MAMA LUCAS'S TEANECK, N.J. HOUSE - CONTINUED              295
      Trupo comes around to the front of the kennel again with his
      gun out and aims it at the dog. As he fires -

      Richie pulls at the zipper, parting the plastic body bag,
      revealing the remains of a young soldier -

                   That's enough.

      The dead dog slides against the fencing as Trupo overturns
      the kennel to reveal Frank's stash of cash.

298   INT. AIRPORT HANGER OFFICE - MINUTES LATER - DAY             298

      Richie and Toback sit before the Federal Attorneys and
      customs agents. The US Attorney hangs up a phone ... then:

                             US ATTORNEY
                That was a military transport plane. If
                there was heroin on board then someone in
                the military would have to be involved.
                Which means that even as it fights a war
                that's claimed 50,000 Americans lives,
                the military is smuggling narcotics.

      Richie's in serious trouble and knows it.    As does Toback.

                             US ATTORNEY
                That's how these events are being
                interpreted by General Easton in that
                call to me. That someone employed by the
                this office believes the United States
                Army is in the drug trafficking business -
                and is trying to prove it by desecrating
                the remains of young men who've given
                their lives in the defence of democracy.

                             RICHIE
                There are drugs on that plane -

                             US ATTORNEY
                Shut the fuck up.

      Richie does, but can't conceal the contempt he feels for
      these men who've never spent a minute on the street but act
      as if know more than him, and who are, in the unfortunate
      organization of his world, his superiors.

                             US ATTORNEY
                Is it any wonder then, because of your
                actions, the entire federal narcotics
                program is now in jeopardy of being
                dismantled as completely and enthusiastic-
                ally as that fucking transport plane?
                That's what you've accomplished Mr.
                Roberts. Single-handedly.

                             RICHIE
                I had good information the target of my
                investigation was bringing dope in on
                that plane.

                             US ATTORNEY
                And that target is?

                                                                 (CONT)

                                  RICHIE
                   Frank Lucas.

      No one in the room, except Richie and Toback, has ever
      heard the name. The federal men regard one another blankly.

                                US ATTORNEY
                   Who?  Who's Frank Lucas?
                          (no one seems to know)
                   Who's he work for? Which family?

                                RICHIE
                   He's not Italian. He's black.

      Now there's a longer, even deeper silence, before -

                                US ATTORNEY
                   Is that supposed to be some kind of joke?
                   You're this close to the end of your
                   career in law enforcement, you're making
                   jokes?

                                RICHIE
                   I believe Frank Lucas is above the mafia
                   in the dope business. I believe he buys
                   direct from the source in Southeast Asia,
                   cuts out all the middlemen, and uses US
                   military planes and personnel to bring
                   pure No. 4 heroin into United States.

      Richie is looking at faces that are still trying to make
      sense out of his ridiculous theory. Toback tries to come to
      his defense -
                                TOBACK
                   Richie has a lot of experience -

                                US ATTORNEY
                   Does he. And how many arrests has he
                   made in his so-called investigation?

                                RICHIE
                   I was promised when I took this job, it
                   was about real arrests.

                                US ATTORNEY
                   Does that mean `none?'

                                RICHIE
                   I have cases against most of Frank's
                   organization. Not him -

                    If you'd have been a preacher, your
                    brothers would be preachers. If you'd

                           (he doesn't say)
                    They all came here because of you. You
                    called and they came running. They look
                    up to you. They expect you to always
                    know what's best.

        Walks toward the front door to leave. Hesitates near it a
        long moment. Then turns and walks upstairs. Trupo will

        Down in the basement, the body bags are lifted from the
        wooden coffins. Set down on tables. The bags unzipped and
        the bodies removed.

        A rack of clean uniforms is brought in. The morticians
        begin dressing the corpses and applying make-up on the dry
        gray skin.

        New white military caskets are trundled in. Gold handles
        lifted. The bodies, clothed and painted now, are deposited
        on the silk linings. The lids of the coffins come down and
        cellophane bags containing folded flags are taped on top.

           by his detectives' cars, recognizes the young driver - who's          
           wearing the same Yankee baseball cap in his T.O. photo.               

           As Richie and his detectives climb into their cars, two               
           Lucas cars fold in behind the laundry truck. The detectives           
           follow at a distance -

           The sea of ladies' hats from above move in time with the
           gospel choir. As always, no matter what else is going on in
           his complicated life, Frank sits with his mother and Ana in
           their usual pew. The gospel music continues over:                     

A315       EXT. BAPTIST CHURCH - MORNING                                  A315

           Frank emerges from the church, kisses his mother and Ana and
           put them in a car with a driver. He climbs into Doc's
           alone. His mother watches, wondering perhaps if he intends
           to go kill Trupo after all. As Doc's car leaves, so does
           another.

           The laundry truck approaches a ramp leading to the George
           Washington Bridge. Richie, a couple of car lengths behind,
           follows. The truck continues straight.

           From overhead, the laundry truck, the gun car and the van -
           and the detectives' cars following them all - converge from
           different directions -

                                                                   114.

       Red Top's van makes a turn. As Abruzzo's makes the same
       turn behind it, the infamous Stephen Crane Projects rise up
       in his windshield.

       His foot comes off the gas. As the gun car passes, he
       sees Jones's car slow. Teddy's car approaches from another
       direction into the Projects, and Abruzzo sees Spearman pull
       over. Then the laundry truck turns in, and Richie's slows
       to a stop, like Abruzzo's, outside the grounds of the
       foreboding towers. The gospel music ends.

       Doc waits in the car while Frank buys some flowers at a
       cemetery flower stand. The surveillance car cruises past.

       Richie, on a pay phone across down the street from the
       Projects, looks up at the dark South tower.

                              RICHIE
                 Lou. We're ready to go in there
                 knowing there's a good chance we won't

       then begin changing for work, which means undressing.

       Pharmaceutical scales balance to their counterweights as
       the five naked, masked women cut the heroin with quinine to
       Frank's exacting standards. Red Top puts on some coffee.

       Richie stares down the street, waiting for whatever it is
       they're waiting for. Spearman looks at his watch.

       A paper-cutter blade slices a sheet of blue cellophane.
       The girls at the tables, with the expertise of Cuban cigar
       makers, wrap pieces of the cellophane like tobacco leaves
       around precisely-measured 1/4-ounce drifts of Black Magic.

       Frank's car winds up the road of the cemetery. The
       surveillance car comes through the main gate and parks.

       Several black and white and undercover cars approach,
       sirens off. Toback himself climbs out of one of the cars
       and hands Richie the search warrant.

       The tall buildings cast long shadows of dread on every
       activity below, no matter how routine: A woman pushing a
       stroller, guys shooting hoops, a couple arguing, kids on
       bikes, old men resting on a graffiti-covered bench.

       The unmarked cars drive slowly through it all. The place
       teeters on the brink of violence you can feel as gangs move
       under the shadow of the towers.

332    INT. GROUND FLOOR, SOUTH TOWER, THE PROJECTS - DAY           332

       Richie removes the cover plate of an elevator, cuts the
       wires, disengaging it, then leads the Amigos, followed by
       more detectives to a stairwell. The place is like Beirut.
       Debris-strewn, graffiti-covered.

       Frank walks past graves to Bumpy's. Replaces some dried
       flowers with fresh ones. Looks around for something to sit
       on. Sees some wooden folding chairs around a fresher grave
       nearby. Doc waits by the car in the distance.

       Floor by floor, they work their way up the tower like
       commandos, the squalor and decay and hopelessness somehow
       intensifying the higher up they go.

       Reaching the 17th floor, they listen to a strange sound
       before easing the fire door open enough to see a kid on a
       Big Wheels pedalling straight at them. He passes and the
       sound fades.

334    INT. 17TH FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY                                334

       Half the apartment doors are gone. TVs and radios echo,
       voices argue, infants wail. The detectives come around a
       corner and see at the end of it: a couple of guys with a
       sawed-off shotguns sitting outside a closed door.

       They step back. Consider one other. Spearman volunteers
       with a nod, continues on alone as the others wait. He walks
       up to the guys with the guns.

                              SPEARMAN

                   business except to knock on the fuckin
                   door and get him.

      As the guy stands, pumping the shotgun, Spearman yanks it
      hard against his throat like a garrote, forcing him to the
      floor. The shotgun explodes, showering plaster and pellets.
      Jones and Abruzzo are instantly all over the other guy as
      Richie swings the sledgehammer into the door -

      The door splinters - the room already in chaos - Teddy,
      panicked, runs for the bedroom - the detectives crash in
      yelling at the girls to get down - a shot from somewhere
      inside wings Abruzzo - Jones and Spearman firing back -
      crawling across the floor like an infantrymen -

      Richie comes into the darkened bedroom leading with his
      pistol. But Teddy's gone. He sees a tapestry of a tiger on
      a wall. Pulls at it, finds a big hole knocked into another
      dark apartment, climbs through, sees an open door -

336   INT. THE PROJECTS BUILDING - CONTINUOUS                        336

      As Richie rushes out to the hallway he can hear footfalls
      echoing in the stairwell. He starts down, taking the stairs
      five at a time, chases Teddy down two flights -                      

      Teddy yanks open a door, runs down a corridor, bangs into            
      an apartment. Richie reaches the apartment just as Teddy is          
      goes out onto an exterior balcony -                                  
      Richie continues along the interior corridor, running                
      parallel to Teddy on the balcony, who trips over some debris         
      and garbage, looking over his shoulder for Richie -                  

      Richie cuts through another apartment to head him off, but           
      the door to the balcony is nailed shut. So are the windows.          
      Richie looks around, grabs a small portable television and,          
      just as Teddy runs past, hurls it through a window at him,           
      hitting him in the head.                                             

      He falls hard, dazed. Richie hurries through the broken              
      window. Teddy comes to and fights back, until Richie breaks          
      his femur with his bare hands. Teddy howls in excruciating
      pain -

       Frank, on a wooden folding chair at Bumpy's grave, hears
       the gunning of engines and barking of cops. He turns to see
       Doc being handcuffed on the ground by the Towncar. Glances
       to a lone figure walking toward him over a rise. Richie.

       Richie arrives at the grave. Regards the monument to
       Ellsworth Johnson, and Frank sitting calmly regarding him.
       Richie glances around the peaceful surroundings ...

       Frank looks at the trees, then at Richie, with equal
       serenity.

       Richie cuts the tags off a new, inexpensive suit. Slips               
       the jacket on, which seemed somehow to fit a little better            
       at the store. Cuts the tags off a tie.

       Someone throwing up in a stall. The toilet flushes, the               
       door opens and Richie steps up to a sink, regards his face            
       in the mirror. Under the fluorescent lights - maybe under             
       any kind - his skin is a shade of death. He splashes water            
       on it and tries to gather himself.

       At the prosecutors table, Richie steals glances at the
       battery of expensive attorneys over at the defense table.


                                                                    (CONT)

      The courtroom doors swing open and Richie sees Frank Lucas,
      in a tailored suit, escorted in without cuffs by an amiable-           
      looking federal marshal.

      As Frank moves through the gallery, Richie sees it's full of
      the gangster's friends, many of them celebrities, who smile
      and greet and fawn as if the Pope has arrived.

      Richie has evidence tables covered with cash, weapons,
      stocks, bonds, property deeds, pictures of Frank's holdings,
      heroin in blue cellophane.

      Frank has celebrities, community leaders, Joe Louis himself
      who will testify to Frank's benevolent character. The Champ
      hugs the heroin trafficker warmly in front of everyone and
      Richie wonders if he should just give up now.

      Richie sees it in slow motion: the hands reaching out to
      Frank, the pats on his back, lipsticked mouths of beautiful
      women offering kisses and words of encouragement, his old
      mother giving him a hug.

      He watches Frank's head turn slowly, his eyes passing his
      phalanx of attorneys, the jury, finally settling on Richie
      in his cheap suit seated at the prosecutors table.

      Frank's eyes smile as they regard Richie, and seem to ask,
      Can you see this - can you see what you're up against - can
      you see how insignificant you are?                                     

      Reaching the end of the welcoming line finally, Frank                  
      brushes by Richie and disappears from view somewhere within            
      the protective husk of his multi-million-dollar legal team.            
                                JUDGE

      Richie slowly lifts himself from his chair, steps forward,             
      turns to look at the jury that's studying him, finally finds           
      his voice:                                                             

                                RICHIE                                       
                   Thank you, your Honor.   Ladies and                       
                   gentlemen -                                               

343   INT. COUNTY JAIL - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY                        343

      Wire mesh separates Frank from his battalion of lawyers.
      He glances over them to Richie being led through the large
      Visiting Room.

                                FRANK
                   Here he is, let me talk to him alone.
                                                                    (CONT)

      The attorneys get up and leave. Richie takes their place.
      Frank regards him a moment, offering the same knowing smile
      from the courtroom. Richie offers nothing.

                                FRANK
                   I just heard something. I said it
                   couldn't be true. You didn't really
                   turn in a million dollars you found
                   in the trunk of a car, did you?

      Richie doesn't say. Frank searches his face for some clue
      to where on earth he's from.

                                FRANK
                   Want me to tell you what happened to
                   it? It ended up in cops' pockets.

                                  RICHIE
                   Maybe.

                                FRANK
                   Maybe? No. It did. All you did was
                   give it to them for nothing in return.
                   Not nothing: You got their contempt.

      Frank studies him.

                                FRANK
                   Why'd you do that? What're you trying
                   to prove, you're better than them? You're
                   not better than them. You are them.

                                RICHIE
                   I don't have the time or interest to
                   listen to (this) -

                                FRANK
                   You did it because it was right.
                   That's all. Why's that hard to say?
                   The question is would you do it again?
                   That was a long time ago. It'd be very
                   easy to find out. Tell me you want to
                   find out, tell me the address, and a car
                   will be there, the trunk loaded.

      Richie knows Frank isn't kidding ...

                                  RICHIE
                   No, thanks.

      Frank suddenly explodes -


                                                                       (CONT)

343   CONTINUED:                                                      343


                                FRANK
                   Who the fuck are you to say no to
                   that? You think that impresses me?

      Guards look over, then glance away once it's clear the
      outburst is through. Richie remains serene. Eventually -

                                FRANK
                   Let me ask you something. You think by
                   putting me in jail, you're going to stop
                   even one junkie from dying? Because you
                   won't. If it isn't me, it'll be someone
                   else. With me or without me, nothing's
                   going to change.

                                RICHIE
                   Then that's the way it is.

                                FRANK
                   You have any sort of case? Or just
                   that idiot drives for my brother. Is he
                   your case? Because if it's just him and
                   the powder, it's not enough.

                                RICHIE
                   Then you got nothing to worry about.

      But Frank is worried, most of all by this cop who doesn't
      take money sitting placidly in front of him.

                                FRANK
                   My brothers won't talk to you. My
                   cousins. None of my family. No one but
                   that mother fucking driver.
                                RICHIE
                   I got more than that. I got a line of
                   people wanting to testify that stretches
                   out the door and around the block.

                                FRANK
                   Bullshit.

                                RICHIE
                   Is it? Tony the Bug.     Benny Two-Socks.
                   Carmine Camanetti.

                                FRANK
                   Who the fuck are they? I don't know
                   them and they don't know me.



                                                                     (CONT)

                                RICHIE
                   They sell dope for the Mazzano crime                      
                   family. Which you all but put out of
                   business.

                                FRANK
                   This is who you're going to put on the
                   stand? Guys who don't know me? Who got
                   nothing to do with me?

                                RICHIE
                   They have everything to do with you.
                   And the only thing they hate more than
                   you is what you represent.

                                FRANK
                   I don't represent nothing.

                                RICHIE
                   You don't? Black businessman like you?
                   Of course you do. But once you're gone,
                   things can return to normal.

                                FRANK
                   Look at me. You looking? Can you tell
                   by looking it would mean nothing to me if
                   tomorrow you turned up dead?

                                RICHIE
                   Get in line. That one stretches around
                   the block, too.

      Frank has never been so frustrated by anyone in his life.
      He wants to work something out with Richie obviously, but he
      can't figure out how. Frank studies him.

                                FRANK
                   What can we do?

                                RICHIE
                   You know what you have to do.                             

      Frank does, but doesn't like it, and doesn't know if he can            
      do it.                                                                 

                                FRANK                                        
                   I could give you cops, but that's not                     
                   who you want, is it. You want organized                   
                   crime names.                                              

                                RICHIE                                       
                   I'll take them, too.   I want them all.                   

                                                                    (CONT)

      Frank isn't sure he heard right.                                       

                                FRANK                                        
                   You'll take them, too? You'd go after                     
                   cops? Are you serious? You'd do that?                     
                   Lock up your own kind?

                                RICHIE
                   They're not. Not the ones in business                     
                   with you. They're not my kind any more                    
                   than the Italians are yours.

      They regard one another in silence.      Richie can tell Frank
      sees daylight.

                                FRANK
                   What can you promise me?

                                RICHIE
                   I can promise you if you lie to me about
                   one name, you'll never get out of prison.
                   Lie about one dollar in one offshore
                   account, you'll never get out. You can
                   live rich in jail the rest of your life,
                   or poor outside it, that's what I can
                   promise.

      Frank is silent for several moments.      Finally -

                                FRANK
                   You know, I don't care if the feds take
                   all my buildings, my stocks, my off-shore
                   accounts. They can take it all, I don't
                   care - use it to build battleships, paint
                   bridges, whatever the fuck they want.
                   Fight another war. But those other
                   motherfuckers - the cops - put my money
                   in their pockets. Millions.

                                RICHIE
                   I believe it.

      Frank debates with himself the step he's about to take ...

                                RICHIE

      Legend:   Frank Lucas was convicted of Conspiracy to
                Distribute Narcotics and sentenced to 70 years.
                He served 15 of them.

      Legend:   Federal authorities confiscated over 250 million
                dollars from him in real estate, equities and cash
                in US and foreign banks.

      Legend:   The day after he convicted Frank Lucas and 30 of
                his Country Boy relatives, Richard Roberts borrowed
                $400 from his credit union to help pay for a 3-day
                vacation to the Bahamas.

      Richie, carrying the box, switches off the lights and closes
      the door behind him on his way out.

      Legend:   Six months later, he quit the Prosecutors Office
                to become a defense attorney. His first client was
                Frank Lucas.

354   EXT. PRISON - DAY (1990)                                      354

      Frank steps out into sunlight, free but owning nothing but
      the cardboard box in his arms. Looks out across the parking
      lot to see if anyone has come to pick him up. Sees Richie
      by his car, hand raised above his head like a flag.

355   EXT. 116TH STREET, HARLEM - DAY                               355

      The two of them stand outside Richie's car on the same
      corner Frank shot Tango. Frank looks up at the street signs
      that used to say 116th Street and 8th Avenue. Now they say
      116th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard.

                              FRANK
                 Frederick Douglass Boulevard? What was
                 wrong with just plain 8th Avenue?

      He considers the street itself. It too has changed. The
      corner groceries, as Bumpy prophesied, really are gone now.



                                                                  (CONT)

                                FRANK
                   I used to sit here with Ana in my old
                   car. She hated it. Now I don't even
                   have a car. Or her.

      Frank glances to where his favorite diner used to be, and
      across the street to where he shot Tango. It isn't a fruit
      stand any more.

                                FRANK
                   Just do what?

                                RICHIE
                   What?

                                FRANK
                   The fuck is that? Just do what?

      It's a Nike store with huge paintings of Michael Jordan and
      the admonition "Just Do It."

                                 RICHIE
                   Sneakers.   Expensive ones.

                                FRANK
                   Who the fuck would buy those?

      A car equipped with sub-woofer bass comes booming past.
      Frank stares at it with the same pained look Bumpy had at
      the discount emporium.

                                RICHIE
                   Your brothers know you're out?
                                FRANK
                   I haven't talked to them in years. It's
                   better that way. For them. I don't know
                   where they are. Went back to Greensboro
                   when they got out, I guess.

      Richie nods.    Frank looks back at the new storefronts.

                                FRANK
                   What am I going to do now, be a janitor?
                   What do I know how to do? How am I going
                   to live?

                                RICHIE
                   I told you I wouldn't let you starve.

                                FRANK
                   You told me but you can barely take care
                   of yourself.
                                (MORE)

                                                                     127.
                               
355   CONTINUED:                                                      355
                                FRANK (CONT'D)
                          (glances to a pay phone on
                           the corner)
                   You know, one phone call, Richie, I could
                   be back in business.

      The look Richie gives him calmly assures Frank if he did
      that it'd be the last phone he made outside prison - ever.

                                 FRANK
                   I won't.   I'm just saying I could.

      He buttons the cuffs of the fake Members Only windbreaker
      Richie bought him off the street.

                                FRANK
                   Thanks for the clothes.

                                RICHIE
                   You're welcome.

      Frank glances away to three young hoods coming toward them
      like they own the sidewalk and everything around it - baggy
      pants, bandanas tied around their heads.

                               FRANK
                   Uh-oh. Look out. Here come the
                   gangsters.

      Frank's right in their path but doesn't move, forcing one
      of them to squeeze between him and a parking meter. The
      gangsta looks back, is about to say something, or do
      something, but, examining the expression of quiet menace on
      Frank's face, thinks better of it. The others stop.

                                GANGSTA 2
                   What.

      The first one is still staring at Frank, but finally has the
      good sense to let it go.

                                GANGSTA 1
                   Nothing.

      They move on.    Frank glances to Richie.

                                FRANK
                   Every idiot gets to be young once.

      Frank zips up his Members Only jacket, props up the collar
      and points himself in the other direction.

                                FRANK
                   Let's get out of here.
