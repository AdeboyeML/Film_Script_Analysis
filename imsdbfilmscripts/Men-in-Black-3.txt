          CLOSE ON A PAIR OF MIRROR AVIATOR SUNGLASSES

          Standard issue throughout the south to abusive, racist prison
          guards.

          Widen to reveal that, indeed, these glasses are on the
          sneering face of just such a man.
          We follow the guard

          DOWN A DINGY PRISON HALLWAY

          Paint peeling off the rusty bars. Somewhere, someone is
          playing harmonica. Prisoners yell complaints as he passes.
          He meets them all with--

                         GUARD
          Shut up, convict! Get yer hands
          off the bars!

          The guard passes through several levels of security doors,
          deeper and deeper into the more secure bowels of the prison --
          home of the scum of the scum.
          Meanwhile...

          PRISON VISITING ROOM

          The lazy-ass guards in charge of screening visitors read
          magazines, watch TV. Footsteps -- someone's here. Which
          pisses them off, because that means they actually have to do
          their jobs.

          The unseen visitor buzzes for help. They take their time
          getting off their asses. When they finally look up, their
          gaze becomes a leer. Follow it to:
          DEVIL GIRL, the visitor. Too tall, too muscled, but hot if
          you're into that kind of thing -- an R. Crumb drawing come to
          life.

          She holds a CAKE -- the cutest, perfectly-frosted pink cake
          right off the cover of the Betty Crocker cookbook.

                         GUARD 2
          Lookie here. Yaz's visitor. I
          guess even a turd gets flies to
          land on it.

                         GUARD 3

          They smirk, hoping for a reaction. Devil girl emits a low,
          sinister growl like an angry Doberman... The guards look at
          each other and GET DOWN TO BUSINESS:

                         GUARD 2
          I.D., visitation papers.

          BACK DOWN THE HALLWAY WITH THE GUARD
          He reaches the end of the hallway. The biggest, most
          absurdly-reinforced double security door. He punches in a
          code.
          The giant door retracts -- its immense weight has it
          squeaking and groaning the whole way. Whoever's behind this
          thing must've done something REAL bad.

          WITH DEVIL GIRL
          Going through the metal detectors, waved over with security
          wands. The guards are being thorough. Maybe more thorough
          than they need to be. They check everything -- even the
          cake. The digital readout tells them NO METAL DETECTED.

                         GUARD 3
          She's clean. Well, not CLEAN, but
          you know.
          They laugh, buzz her through.

          WITH THE GUARD
          The giant door finally opens, he continues to the end of the
          hallway. Stops in front of a cell. Yells in:

                         GUARD
          Hey, Yaz! You got a visitor.
          Let's go, pretty boy.

                         VISITING ROOM
          Spare. Just a table and chairs in the middle -- poured
          concrete. Nothing a convict could, say, smash into the face
          of a guard.
          The perimeter of the room is lined with armed guards -- looks
          like they're not taking chances.

          At the lone table -- Devil Girl waits with her cake. She
          hears the door open -- her face lights up as IN STEPS HER

                         BELOVED --
          YAZ, an evil hippie/biker badass right out of Easy Rider. A
          huge mane of hair, a big handlebar moustache that frames a
          grubby unshaven face...
          Everything about him seems strangely independently alive --
          every strand of hair, every fringe on his dirty jacket -- the
          way Elvis was in his prime.
          He wears a distinctive SKULL PINKIE RING. A smirk plays on
          his mouth that says -- I'm smarter than you, asshole.
          The guards escort Yaz, who can barely walk in his CHAINS and
          MANACLES. They dump him into one of the chairs. Devil Girl
          jumps up, they lock in a kiss -- it goes on too long.
          A guard pokes them with his billy club --

                         GUARD 2
          This ain't a conjugal visit.
          quit yer conjugating.

                         YAZ
          When's the last time you conjugated
          anything?

                         DEVIL GIRL
          I brought you a cake.

                         YAZ
          Thanks, darling.

          Hey could you cut this up for us?
          It's our anniversary. I'm romantic
          like that.
          A guard picks up the cake. Smirks and takes a dirty three-
          fingered scoop of frosting.

                         GUARD 2

          But in a flash, the mouth SPRINGS OUT -- IT BELONGS TO A
          VORACIOUS ALIEN -- another springs out behind it -- they
          consume the guard's entire face.

                         YAZ
          That's why.
          The aliens jump into Yaz's hands like a matching pair of
          grotesque ORGANIC SIDEARMS -- as vicious and bloodthirsty as
          their master, snarling and hungry for blood.
          The guards draw their weapons, but YAZ IS FASTER.-- he
          launches his aliens, taking them all out.
          Yaz "holsters" the aliens and...

          THE PRISON BREAK IS ON!!
          One guard, badly wounded, crawls to SOUND THE ALARM
          In the reflection of a pair of blood-spattered aviator
          glasses -- Devil Girl puts the guard down with his own
          weapon.
          She uses one of the cake-aliens like a saw to get Yaz out of
          his chains.

                         YAZ
          There's nothing sexier than a girl
          killing for me.

          She runs a hand over his bicep.

                         DEVIL GIRL
          You got so strong in prison.

          Yaz notices the almost-dead guard:

                         YAZ
          I'm not just a man of brute force,
          you know. I prefer to be known for
          my rapier wit--
          His tongue SHOOTS OUT OF HIS MOUTH -- like a rapier --
          impaling the guard--

          --and tongue.
          The tongue retracts -- he and Devil Girl KISS.
          They collect weapons off the guards and use the aliens to saw
          open the door.

          YAZ AND DEVIL GIRL ESCAPE
          Prisoners go nuts, guards scramble -- smoke, screaming,
          chaos.
          Yaz and Devil Girl, armed with weapons they took off the dead
          guards, BLAST THEIR WAY OUT.
          He's a sociopathic badass... and she's no slouch either.
           Along the way, Yaz shoots the door off the armory and grabs
          an armload of weapons -- Shotguns, pistols, and a Rocket-
          Propelled grenade (RPG).
          He uses and discards them as he goes.
          They head for the front gate and FREEDOM...
          But..
          They turn the corner and find 50 GUARDS in FULL RIOT GEAR --
          Plexiglass shields, helmets, shotguns -- all aimed at Yaz.
          All Yaz has left is his RPG.

          GUARD ON MEGAPHONE
          Give it up, Yaz! There's no way
          out!
          A beat of stand-off -- Yaz and Devil girl facing off against
          the 50 Guards... No one blinking...
          Prisoners. watching... what's gonna go down?

          You can't win. You've only got one
          shot in there!
          Yaz lets the tension linger -- he seems to enjoy it. The
          guards SWELTER in their heavy riot gear.

                         YAZ

          towards the wall behind the guards. The guards' faces go

          WIDE WITH TERROR.

                         GUARD
          Hey! Whoa! What are you doing?
          Don't do that!

          SLAM!
          Yaz blasts a hole in the wall -- the guards are IMMEDIATELY
          SUCKED OUT like from a hole blown in an airplane.
          What the...?
          Yaz steps through the hole.

          As Yaz fixes his gaze on our planet, his hair, his fringes
          INDEPENDENTLY ARTICULATE YAZ'S MALEVOLENT EMOTIONS... they
          also seem drawn here. Like bees, they express a collective

          Wu walks them to a table, seats them.

          Allow me most honorable benefit of
          get you noodles.

                         (FOR GUYS)
          Be right back, guys.
          Wu walks off. Jay CLOCKS the other diners.

          Something about this strike you as
          weird?

          Look at table two over there. They
          haven't ordered a thing. When's
          the last time Wu let someone sit at
          a table without ordering? And
          table five over there just drank
          his third cup of duck sauce.
          Now Kay's radar is up --

                         KAY
          Come to think of it... Why is Wu
          getting our noodles... outside?

                         JAY
          Because it's about to go down.
          Wu, at the door, closes the blinds. He catches them looking.

          MR. WU
          Sorry, guys.
          Wu leaves, quickly pulling the door behind, him. The guys
          reach for their weapons.
          And IT GOES DOWN --
          It's a SET-UP, and everyone in the restaurant is in on it --
          The hipsters, the families, the wall street guys -- all draw
          various forms of ALIEN WEAPONS and ATTACK
          It's like a close-quarters Mafia hit -- everyone pumping
          truckloads of ordnance at each other. Close hand-to-hand
          combat. Someone wants Jay and Kay dead and they're not
          taking any chances.
          Right ahead of the onslaught, JAY GIVES KAY A HAND SIGNAL --
          He nods, and they dive in opposite directions, SAVING

          THEMSELVES FROM GETTING HIT.
          But not for long...
          An explosive lands between them --
          Kay gets BLOWN OUT THE FRONT WINDOW, rolls to a stop in the
          middle of the

                         DESERTED STREET

          INSIDE WITH JAY
          Getting the worst of it.
          A messy battle THROUGH THE KITCHEN.
          The Giant fish's tank gets shot -- the FISH IS FREE! And he
          goes RIGHT AFTER JAY!

                         JAY
          You probably took that whole

          Jay BATTLES THE FISH-- throwing pots and pans in its mouth,

          Yaz getting closer. He pulls out a CANNON of a gun, fires
          into the air.

          Kay throws the gun at Yaz.
          Yaz laughs. Gets Kay in his sights.

          All I wanted was justice, Kay.
          Justice for my brothers. But you

          Reveal Jay, just fired the shot.
           Jay looks like total hell, beaten up, covered with 8 kinds of
          slime and alien guts.
          He stumbles over to Kay, who in contrast looks perfectly
          pressed.

                         JAY
          So I was thinking about making a

          Jay and Kay back in their booth, Jay grabs a couple noodles
          off another table and starts eating.
          Through the scene, various MiB clean-up crew people work the

          Now listen. This is highly
          crucial: Time travel is nothing to
          mess with. You can't change
          anything, you can't use new
          technology or all of space-time can

          Pure white.
          Jay comes to, groggy, like he has the worst hangover of all
          time, brain bigger than his skull, trying to make his eyes
          focus.
          Trying to make sense of his strange blinding white
          environment -- Is this the afterlife?
          The reverie disrupted by a TOILET FLUSH
          The white resolves into

          INT. BATHROOM

          Jay realizes he's in a men's room, sitting in a urinal. The
          music transitions: Whatever hip-hop featuring a 60s sample
          was playing in the Apple store -- now continues as the 60s
          song itself, played over a tinny portable radio.
          He hops up just as a young white office worker comes out of
          one of the stalls, washes his hands... and flips Jay a
          quarter.
          Jay stares at it a beat, confused. Misreading his confusion,
          the office worker awkwardly digs out another quarter.

                         OFFICE WORKER
          What the heck, you're doing a great
          job.
          The kid leaves.
          Jay ventures out of the bathroom and finds himself in...

          White guys on IBM Selectric typewriters as far as the eye can
          see -- like the office in the Apartment.

          profits of the racist misunderstandings.
          Elevator opens, the elevator operator opens the door -- Jay
          climbs in with a car full of older executives.

          Wow. 1969. You're all dead now.

          completing the look.

          by the guy who must be "The Big Man" Jay HONKS and waves --
          thank you!
          Jay finds some classic 60s music and enjoys himself for a
          minute -- a sweet ride through 60s New York.
          A GREAT 1969 HIT -- THE TEMPTATIONS' "Can't Get Next to You"
          comes on the radio. Jay is swept up in the music and soon is

          SINGING ALONG AT FULL BLAST.
          At a light, he pulls even with an older Brooklyn Italian
          couple. They give him a disapproving look. The woman
          clutches her pearls just a little more protectively.
          He smiles and leans towards them.

          The secret entrance to MiB HQ, familiar from the first movie.
          Jay strides up to the entrance and... can't open the door.
          Bangs on the door -- nothing. Shaking the knob, calling to
          the guard... nothing. From behind him:

          We hear the way-too-loud death-rattle exhaust note of what
          sounds like ten Harleys at once.
          Reveal -- Yaz, the nightmare biker, looking like Dennis
          Hopper meets Satan, riding a badass custom skull-themed rig
          that might have dropped out of the brain of Stanley Mouse.
          His skull ring gleams on his pinkie. Devil Girl sits behind
          him, hands on his shoulders.
          We ride with them a beat, tearing down the highway...
          They STOP AT A LIGHT -- even with a brightly-painted microbus
          full of hippies.

          to make a trade for the mama?
          Yaz pulls out his alien "guns." The stoned hippie smiles
          serenely and puts a flower in one of the mouths. Makes a
          peace sign.

          Yaz "fires" the alien -- it launches into the microbus --
          followed by its brother.
          The microbus rocks, hippies scream, the bus dents from the
          inside-out. On a bumper sticker: If This Van's a-rockin',
          don't come a knockin'.
          The guns, finished, return to Yaz.
          Yaz surveys the carnage, picks up a medallion off one of the
          hippies. But looking at it more closely, frowns and throws
          it away.
          The head back on their way... Blood drips over the Ass, Gas

          Loners and weirdos populate the tables, minding their own

          A cloud of smoke... It clears and reveals
          Mid-century futurism with a martini lunch office vibe. It's

          The cloud of smoke comes from everyone smoking. Aliens run
          around with ashtrays, cocktail shakers and cigarettes. The
          alien smokers smoke from surprising orifices.
          The !liB agents have the feel of ivy league privilege. Very
          male and very white. Women are there to be secretaries and
          eye candy.
          Two many-armed aliens stock the automat. Kay tosses one the
          sandwich, it goes right back into the automat.
          Jay recognizes the aliens -- it's the twins!

          - A wall of Black and White TVs monitoring the aliens of the
          times: Castro... Yoko... Hendrix...
          - A cluster of agents use a joystick to manipulate a very
          high-tech camera. Reveal they're using it to watch a
          secretary's ass. She gets wise, turns -- they raise their
          martinis and she giggles at them: You're incorrigible!
          - Aliens work switchboards, work in the steno pool.
          - Someone barks at an alien to grab a couple Mooners and go
          clean something up.
          - An MiB barbershop quartet practices.

          The skanky guy knows he's in trouble.

                         SKANKY GUY
          Oh... uh... okay, no hassles,
          man... I got it from that dude over
          there... With the beard.
          Jay turns, lets go just long enough for the guy to LEAP OUT

                         THE WINDOW
          Jay takes off after him -- Kay joins
          And the CHASE IS ON

          CHASE THROUGH THE VILLAGE
          Jay and Kay chase the guy through various 60s locations - a
          commune, an ashram, a folk club, a protest.

          Everywhere they are mistaken for "pigs" - people get in their
          way.
          To Jay's surprise, young Kay is a hell of a runner, in
          incredible shape. It gets competitive between them...
          Until Jay can't keep up -- Kay takes off...
          Kay runs the Skanky Guy down -
          Jay huffs and puffs his way over, grabs the medallion.

                         JAY
          Alright, one more time. Where'd
          you get this?

                         SKANKY GUY
          It was a gift--

                         JAY
          Bullshit.
          Kay puts a gun on him.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Oh, hey. This is my partner. He's
          about to get fired for excessive
          violence and he doesn't have much
          left to lose.

                         SKANKY GUY
          I borrowed it!
          CLICK! Kay cocks the gun.

          SKANKY GUY (CONT'D
          I stole it, okay?

                         JAY
          That's what I like. A nice, honest
          thief. Stole it from who?

                         SKANKY GUY
          They don't even care, man. They
          leave their money everywhere.

          The gun comes back out.

                         SKANKY GUY
          I heard they were Archanans.

                         JAY
          Archanans? They're pretty far out
          of their neighborhood. I didn't
          think we'd ever had one on Earth
          before.

                         SKANKY GUY
          I can tell you where they live!
          Southwest corner of 3rd and Avenue
          C. Top floor. Apartment 12.
          Jay rips the medallion off his neck.

          SOUTHWEST CORNER OF 3RD AND AVENUE C
          Jay and Kay pull up in front of the building.

                         KAY
          That address. It's familiar.
          He pulls out a notebook.

          And Yaz kills me?

          Something like that. So do me and
          the people of Earth a favor and be
          careful.

                         KAY
          Aw, put on your big girl panties
          and let's go.

          Jay and Kay ride up...

                         KAY
          That thing back at the party, what
          was it? Some kind of game?

                         JAY
          Not just any game, PONG. Game of
          kings. But it wasn't invented
          until 1974.

                         KAY
          How do you know that?

                         JAY
          Because I was the only kid on my
          block who didn't have one.

                         KAY
          Aw, what's the matter? Daddy
          didn't buy you the toy you wanted?

                         JAY
          Didn't have a daddy to not buy me
          toys. Here's the only thing I ever
          got from him--
          He holds up his key chain.

          DOORS OPEN...

          DOWN THE RATTY HALLWAY
          Jay and Kay move carefully, ready for trouble.
          They get to the door -- Apartment 12.
          Jay points to the door -- THIS IS IT!
          They see -- THE DOOR IS SMASHED IN, PUNCHED OFF ITS HINGES
          And punched into the door -- THE IMPRESSION OF A SKULL RING

                         JAY
          That's from Yaz's ring. He was
          here. Or is here.
          Jay SIGNALS KAY

                         KAY
          Why do you keep doing that?

          INT. STUDIO APARTMENT

          They move into the room on high alert...
          But it's empty.
          They realize the strangeness of the room - alien technology
          (including a TV hooked up to something strange with tons of
          wires hanging out) and lots of money.. LOTS of money...
          Not just piles -- the actual furniture is MADE OF STACKS OF
          MONEY. They've been using it for scrap paper, for napkins.

                         JAY
          So Yaz was never after you... he
          was after the Archanans. You just
          got in the way.

                         KAY
          Which must make them damn

          Like they knew he was coming.

                         KAY
          And he's probably on their trail
          now. But where the hell did they
          go?
          They look around, puzzling over this place. Jay picks up a
          $100 bill off a table made out of stacks of money.

                         JAY
          Think this might tell us something?
          On the $100 bill:
           A strange series of words and numbers: 3 2... 5 1... 7 5..

                         KAY

          We'll take it to HQ, run it through
          the computer. Figure out where
          they went.

          Jay and Kay walk down the dark hallway --
          Yaz steps out of the shadows --

          BACK IN THE CAR
          Jay and Kay head back to HQ. Kay drives, Jay stares at the
          $100 bill, squinting at it, turning it over --

          basically Jodi Foster's Taxi Driver hooker costume --

          He was like nothing I ever saw --

          Remember, please, to take the
          bridge.
          And we begin

          BIG FIGHT SET PIECE.
          Try to include motorcycle and horse elements. Could also
          involve the actual aqueduct, which is close by.
          At one point, Jay and Kay seem stuck, they remember...

                         JAY
          Take the bridge...
          They take the bridge, which gives them an advantage on Yaz.
          At one point, Jay corners Yaz -- Yaz BLASTS HIM -- Jay is
          knocked down. Looks DEAD! But he shakes it off reveal
          the PONG medallion blocked the shot.
          Culminating at a toxic waste dump in Staten Island, with Yaz
          compressed into .a six inch cube - hauled away in the back of
          a garbage truck.
          The guys give chase -- they want him captured, but no luck.
          The truck drives off...

          be really mad.

          AQUEDUCT RACE TRACK
          Jay and Kay return to an EMPTY RACE TRACK...

          And yet --
          They cheer and clap as if watching the most exciting race
          ever.
          Jay and Kay exchange a "what the hell?" Look and approach

          Okay, someday you're gonna explain
          that to me, but right now you need
          to stop the riddles because there's
          about two minutes until Yaz crawls

          into the Station!

                         VENDOR
          I told you ten times -- I got no
          idea what dry ice is!

                         KAY
          (not listening).
          Thanks, you've been very helpful.
          Jay and Kay peel off, follow the MiB agents, leaving the
          Vendor scratching his head. He turns back to the kids.
          Jay and Kay follow the MiBers and Archanans inside...

          INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION

          The Men in Black blend in easily with the guys going home to
          Greenwich, but the Archanans are easy to spot.
          Jay and Kay tail them -- and lose them for an instant!
          They spot a glimpse of robe, run after them, turn a corner --
          And it's just some Hare Krishnas.

                         KAY
          Damn. Wrong freaks.
          But Jay spots the Archanans...

                         JAY
          Over there, Kay!
          As they run off --

                         HARE KRISHNA
          Perhaps you'd like to join us for a
          vegetarian meal?
          Jay and Kay chase after the MiB agents and Archanans --
          The MiB agents approach a cordoned-off area with signs
          warning WET PAINT!
          The agents look around, then slip pass the ropes and through
          a NARROW DOOR marked "WET PAINT" or "MEN WORKING"
          Jay and Kay follow...
          Through the skinny half-painted door...

          THROUGH THE.SKINNY DOOR
          An EQUALLY SKINNY ESCALATOR descends 100s of feet. A
          problem: it's going the WRONG WAY -- bringing incognito
          aliens and MiB agents UP INTO GRAND CENTRAL.
          Jay and Kay muscle their way down -- lots of 'scuse me --
          pardon me -- hey, don't grab that!
          But once they power past the crowds, Jay's jaw drops as we
          reveal...

          SECRET TRAIN STATION
          A MUCH-BIGGER station under Grand Central, a secret hub for
          sending aliens back and forth all over the country.
          It's basically a series of GIANT PNEUMATIC TUBES --people-
          sized versions of the vacuum tubes that used to beeverywhere
          in banks, offices, etc.
          A mix of ALIENS and MIB AGENTS put on helmets and pads, board
          the tubes and FWOOP off...
          Quick shots -- a shoeshine stand set up for many-limbed
          aliens... a newsstand with strange papers... The Beatles in
          line for Liverpool with a blue meanie... Kareem Abdul-
          Jabbar...

          TUBE TO CANADA
          The MiB agents put helmets and pads on the Archanans.
          They're about to load them into the tubes --
          Jay and Kay approach:

          Yeah, but I heard there's some dry
          ice in Queens. Magic show at a
          kid's birthday party. Better
          hustle, you can get there before.
          the cake.
          They all LAUGH at Kay.

          Change in plans.

                         MIB

          Yeah, Ex just gave us the new
          orders -- check this out --
          Kay gestures them closer -- he reaches for something in his
          jacket pocket...
          The MiBers lean in...
          And Kay GRABS THEM AND SHOVES THEM BACKWARDS TOWARDS THE

          TUBE!
          The MiB agents stumble, surprised --
          The Archanans, not surprised, step deftly out of the way, the
          MiBers FWOOP FWOOP FWOOP into the tube...
          Jay and Kay exchange a smile and realize... One last VERY
          YOUNG agent is still standing there, wide-eyed:

                         YOUNG AGENT
          Don't hurt me! I'm just the
          accountant!
          He reaches for his radio... Jay talks him down:

                         JAY
          I know you're a little freaked out
          and you want to call for backup,
          but listen: When you've done this
          job for a while, you realize
          there's one rule -- things aren't
          what they seem. These are innocent
          beings that need our protection.
          Are you gonna do the right thing or
          are you gonna be a company man and
          send them off to die in Toronto?
          The young agent thinks -- puts down the radio.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Good, good. What's your name?

          Zed crosses off...

          Be nice to him. Trust me.
          Jay, Kay and the Archanans regroup.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Okay, you all wanted to go home.
          Well here we are. So how do you
          want to get off this rock? You
          guys have the spaceport on Long
          Island yet?
          Kay just looks at him.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          That place is a dump anyway. Best
          Margaritas in the Universe, my ass.
          What about the one in Ohio?
          The Archanans smile.

                         ATTENDANT
          Here is the way home.
          The Lama removes a postcard-sized card from his robe and
          hands it to one of his attendants.
          The attendant bows, and RITUALLY PASSES IT... it passes
          through all the attendants and then to JAY.
          Jay gives it a look.

                         JAY

                         JAY
          I'll take that as a strong "yes."
          Okay, then. Follow me.
          Jay pockets the card and starts herding them across the
          terminal. Kay catches up --

                         KAY
          Where are we going?
          Jay looks at him a beat.

                         JAY
          Omaha. And I'm gonna buy you the
          biggest T-bone you ever saw when we
          get there. So -- you head over to
          the Omaha tube and I'm gonna help
          these guys over here for a second.
          But I'll meet you in a minute. By
          the Omaha tube.
          They stare at each other --

                         KAY
          Sounds good. See you there.
          Kay turns to head off -- then, lightening fast, spins and
          reaches into Jay's pocket, snatches out the card --

                         KAY (CONT'D)
          Omaha, my ass.
          Kay looks at the card: GREETINGS FROM SUNNY FLORIDA -- a
          tourist post card with palm trees, oranges and beaches.

                         KAY (CONT'D)

                         JAY
          This is why you were there. In
          Florida. Because of them. You
          were helping them and that's why...
          that's why you get killed. Today,
          July 16. I saw the report myself.
          Agent Kay, dead at the scene.
          Killed by Yaz.

          I just want you to know, I'm doing
          this out of love, man.

                         KAY
          Doing what?
          He gets his answer -- Jay DECKS HIM.

                         JAY
          You stay home and stay alive.
          But Kay isn't down.

                         KAY
          I told them I'd help them -- I'm
          honor-bound to do it.
          Kay throws a DIRTY SUCKER-PUNCH to Jay's kidney.
          Jay recovers and throws an UPPERCUT to Kay's solar plexus.
          Jay winces -- like he just hit something hard.

                         JAY
          Damn, you used to have some abs.
          They continue to pound each other. As they trade punches:

          The fight continues... They're wearing down, circling each
          other...

          The ARCHANANS -- very cheerfully, benignly hopping into the

          FLORIDA TUBE.
          Jay and Kay share a look -- and both run INTO THE TUBE!

          moving gracefully, like fish through water...
          Kay is in perfect controlled tube position -- everything
          clenched, hands by his sides, looking like he's in an "air
          luge"...
          Jay is SCREAMING and ricocheting off the sides of the tube
          like a pinball...
          They shoot SOUTH, passing landmarks of the Eastern
          seaboard...
          Intercut with Jay's face -- blown back like Right Stuff
          astronauts in a G-Force simulator.
          Jay FLAILS towards the Archanans, grabs onto the Lama's robe:

          He didn't come yet! Kay, he didn't
          come yet!!!
          Jay races to find Kay.

                         WITH KAY
          Unaware that his appointment with death is near...

          WITH YAZ AND DEVIL GIRL
          Racing down a hallway... hunting Kay...

                         WITH JAY
          Running... running... searching... where is Kay?

          INTERCUT BETWEEN KAY... YAZ... JAY...
          All converging on destiny...

                         WITH JAY
          Running... more frantic now...
          And then he sees him!
          Kay -- at the end of the hallway!. Backlit by the door to
          the outside...

                         JAY
          Kay!
          And then Jay sees -- Yazl Already there!
          Jay goes for his weapon, but he doesn't have the shot!
          Yaz pulls his guns...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.
          Kay turns to see Yaz -- there's no time to react, only to
          know HE'S ABOUT TO DIE!
          Yaz FIRES!!
          But -- THE COLONEL is somehow there instead! He catches the
          bullet for Kay -- his body dematerializes.
          And it gives Jay the split-second he needs to FIRE ON YAZ AND
          KILL HIM, blowing him OUTSIDE -- where he is INCINERATED BY
          LIQUID OXYGEN leftover from the launch.
          They look at each other -- it's over.

                         KAY
          See? I knew you had my back.
          Jay hears footsteps. Looks up and sees the SHADOW OF A TALL

          MAN -- REMARKABLY SIMILAR TO JAY'S OWN SILHOUETTE.
          As the footsteps approach, the shadow grows smaller,
          shrinking to KID SIZE. It's a boy.

                         KID'S VOICE
          Dad? What's going on?
          The kid steps into the light -- backlit -- but from the shape
          of his head and Jay's reaction, this kid could only be YOUNG

          JAY.

                         JAY
          Where there is death, there will
          always be death. He saved your
          life. He swapped his for yours.
          He saved the world.
          Kay puts a firm hand on Jay --

                         KAY
          I'll take it from here.
          Kay steps away... but turns back.
          In a replay of the moment from the first movie, Jay tosses
          Kay a modern Neuralizer.

                         JAY
          Leave me some memories this time,

          OK?

                         KAY
          Sure, partner. I'll see you
          around.

                         JAY
          Yes you will.
          Kay turns back to the boy, takes his hand.
          Jay watches them from a distance:
          Kay takes something off the ground where The Colonel's body
          was -- hands it to the son.

                         KAY
          Hey, look -- your Dad wanted you to
          have this.
          Kay gives the kid a shiny new commemorative Apollo key chain.
          Jay looks in his pocket -- the same key chain, scratched and
          worn.

                         YOUNG JAY
          Where is he?

                         KAY
          Your daddy had to go -- he's part
          of the space program, now. He's
          okay, he just had to take a trip up
          to the stars, but you'll be just
          fine. I'll keep an eye on you...
          They are silhouetted by the bright light of the Apollo
          launch...
          Jay takes out his iPhone and ALL GOES WHITE...

          PURE WHITE LIGHT...
          And it resolves into...

          NEW YORK - BACK TO PRESENT DAY...
          Jay comes to in the Apple Store, looks to the sky and

          THE MISSILES ARE STILL COMING!!!

                         JAY
          Noo!!!!
          And then...
          A giant PONG PADDLE rises over the horizon and

          PONGS THE MISSILES BACK INTO SPACE

          EXT. MIB HQ ENTRANCE/VENTILATION BUILDING

          Jay is walking on air -- thrilled to see the deadpan security
          guard.

                         JAY
          It's good to see you, man.
          He gives him a hug-- gets a "what the hell?" face.

          INT. MIB HQ

          Jay is thrilled to be back -- hugging everyone he can.
          No one else knows what he's talking about -- from their POV
          he never left... It all seems the same except for quick shots
          of Ex the bitter janitor, aged Devil Girl pushing the coffee
          cart...
          Jay bounces through the MiB HQ -- it's just a regular day to
          everyone else, but it's HOME SWEET HOME to Jay.
          He even gives the worm guys a big, gushy hug.
          A crowd of people gathers around Kay, congratulating him on
          winning the Bowling trophy... AGAIN.
          Kay looks up -- SMILES BIG when he sees Jay.

                         KAY
          Alright, everyone, give me and my
          partner here a minute.
          They leave the guys alone. A beat -- and Jay just wraps him
          in THE BIGGEST HUG EVER.

                         JAY
          It's good to see you, man. So
          good. I just... do you remember...
          I mean, do you know what I've been
          through?
          Kay just stares at him.

                         KAY
          You mean, do I remember that you
          travelled back in time to save my
          life and the world? Not bad,
          slick. Not bad.

                         JAY
          No problem. You'd do the same for
          me. I just have one question...

          I forget you when everyone else
          did?

                         KAY
          Well, I don't know exactly.
          Because I was dead. But in a
          quantum reality, objects can exist
          in contradictory states... So
          multiple timelines with varying
          probabilities can exist, and the
          one you're closest to

                         JAY

          closeness... you're talking about
          our love... Across timelines!
          You're saying our love will go on!
          Kay swats him away -- but the love couldn't be more clear.
          Jay feels something in his pocket -- the keychain. Takes it
          out.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          He was a good man.

          Yes he was.

          I'm glad I know that.
