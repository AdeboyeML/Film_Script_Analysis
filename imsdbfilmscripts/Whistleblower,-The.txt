                         GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.) (UKRAINIAN)
               I can't see anything... Are you there?

    Silence.

                         GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.) (UKRAINIAN) (CONT'D)
               Are you there!?

    Giggling. LUBA, 15, dangerous, flicks a lighter, sparking a
    cigarette, and grins in the flickering flame.

                         LUBA (UKRAINIAN)
               God I'm drunk... Where's this damn door?

    She scans the space with the lighter. Illuminating...

                         RAYA (UKRAINIAN)
               Watch it! That's my hair! Let me try.

    RAYA, 15, pretty, guileless, takes the lighter, searching...
    CLICK. She has it. They BURST out the door, LAUGHING, onto...

2   EXT. ROOFTOP - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT                       2

    A PARTY. ROCK MUSIC BLARES. DRUNK TEENS dance around BURNING
    BARRELS. GROUPS lounge on ratty couches and turned over boxes
    skulling cans, making out, talking shit. A BOY, 17, lights a
    MOLOTOV COCKTAIL and hurls it off the roof.

    Luba and Raya join THREE GUYS. ONE of them pisses onto a
    cloth, stuffs it in a bottle, and tries to light it. It
    FIZZLES. Everybody bursts out laughing.

                         RAYA (UKRAINIAN)
               It's ammonia, not alcohol.

                         BOY (UKRAINIAN)
               (Drunk) You're so smart. I love you!

    He lunges in for a kiss, but she dodges him, laughing. Luba
    gives him the finger, pulling Raya toward the dancing into...

    TEEN MAYHEM: Raya lets herself go. She gets lost in...

    A WHIRL of drunk and happy teens. It's tribal. They dance,
    silhouetted against the fire and the black sky, their backs
    to the run-down Soviet buildings... Tonight, they don't want
    to think about what life holds in store.

    Raya stops. Dizzy. She looks at her watch, suddenly aware of
    the time. Yelling over to Luba...
                                                           TWB 2.


                        RAYA (UKRAINIAN)
              I have to get home. Mama's gonna kill me.

                        LUBA (UKRAINIAN)
              No, you're staying with me tonight. Roman
              wants us there at 9 in the morning.

    Raya looks at Luba. Torn.

                        LUBA (CONT'D)
              It's just a few months working in a
              hotel. You want to work at Copyshack like
              your mother? Marry one of these assholes?
              There's nothing here!.. He said it was
              both of us or no go!

    Raya sighs, wanting to, but unable to agree. Luba hesitates;
    she needs this so badly.

                        LUBA (CONT'D)
              Fuck your mom!

    But Raya shakes her head, eyes apologetic. She pushes past
    Luba who watches her disappear.

3   INT. RAYA'S APARTMENT - KYIV - LATE NIGHT                       3

    Raya tiptoes through a modest apartment when.... The lights
    come on. Raya turns back to see HALYNA, 35. Her face torn
    between anger and relief.

                        RAYA (UKRAINIAN)
              I know I'm late. I tried to leave, but--

                        HALYNA (UKRAINIAN)
              It's three in the morning.

    Halyna shakes her head, disappointed. Then turns off the
    lights. Raya stands alone as Halyna goes into her bedroom.
    SLAM. Raya looks around the apartment, it's poverty, it's
    measly aspirations...

4   EXT. KYIV - MORNING                                             4

    Raya sits on a stool before a WHITE WALL. Luba smokes a
    cigarette. ROMAN, 40, smiley, fixes a camera to a tripod.

                           ROMAN (UKRAINIAN)
              Big smile!

    Luba reads a SWISS HOTEL BROCHURE, then looks up.

                        LUBA (UKRAINIAN)
              (practicing) I am Natalya Verbova. I am
              going to Budapest to buy carpets for re-
              selling. I am staying two days...

    Raya sees ZENIA, 30, peeking in the door. Raya smiles. Zenia,
    nods, demure. Roman looks through the camera.

                        LUBA (CONT'D)
              No-one's gonna believe we really did it!

    Luba beams at Raya, who can't hide her own excitement.

    CAMERA POV: Raya looks into the camera. Her face lights up
    with hope... FLASH... The IMAGE FREEZES... We BURN TO WHITE.
    Then the title of the film fades in...

                         "THE WHISTLEBLOWER"

    A FLASHLIGHT cuts across...

6   EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - LINCOLN, NEBRASKA - NIGHT                   6

    POLICE OFFICER LEEDS scans the side of a house. Rounding to

    THE FRONT PORCH

    He shakes his head at his partner, KATHRYN BOLKOVAC, 38.
    Earthy and athletic. She is in great shape, but her eyes tell
    of a life fully lived. She's looking at a HUSBAND and WIFE
    standing in the doorway.

                        HUSBAND
              It just got a bit heated, you know how it
              gets. I'll apologize to the neighbors
              tomorrow.

    Kathy nods, humoring. A police radio BUZZES.

                        OFFICER LEEDS
              Ready to go?

    Kathy eyes the wife, tries to see past them into the house.

                        KATHY
              You sure everything is alright, Ma'am?

    The wife is still. Kathy eyes her, gently. Then, calm...

                        WIFE
              Really. It was nothing.
                                                              TWB 4.




    The husband shifts his weight. Kathy flits a look behind him,
    noticing... Jackets hanging from the wall. Her gaze lowers to
    a hook hanging much lower than the rest of the jackets.

                        KATHY
              You all have any children?

                        HUSBAND
              Nope.

    The wife looks down. The man stirs, agitated.

                        HUSBAND (CONT'D)
              So if that's all Officer...

                        KATHY
              I'd like to take a quick walk through the
              house.

                        HUSBAND
              You can't do that without a warrant.

                        KATHY
              Yes I can, Sir, please step aside.

    The wife moves out of the way. The man panics. Leeds heads up
    the porch. Kathy steps over the threshold. When...

                        HUSBAND
              You're not coming in my house!

    He blocks her, but Kathy pushes past him, and then he...

    GRABS Kathy. HURLS her into a wall. CRACK. Kathy yells in
    EXTREME PAIN.

    Three POLICE OFFICERS linger. They peek through a door at...

8   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - SAME                                          8

    Kathy. She sits up on a gurney. The DOCTOR examines her
    shoulder. It's BRUISED PURPLE.

                        DOCTOR
              Painful there?

    Kathy winces.
                                                       TWB 5.


CAPTAIN HAWK, 50s, African American, walks in, noticing her
exposed shoulders, and turns, uncomfortable. Kathy covers.

                    HAWK
          I'm her Captain.

                    DOCTOR
          Her collar bone is broken. And I'm going
          to have to set her arm in a cast.

                    HAWK
          Lookin' for a route to the desk?

                    KATHY
          Yeah, I'm gonna break every bone in my
          body until I'm captain.

Hawk laughs.

                    KATHY (CONT'D)
          I'm fine. I'm sure you have a hotter date
          than this tonight.

                    HAWK
          I wish.

                    KATHY
          Just when my self esteem was gettin' so
          healthy.

                    HAWK
          We found a boy locked in the basement.
          Badly beaten. We charged the husband with
          domestic assault. You made the right
          call. But you should've waited for
          backup. (sighing)... I wish I didn't have
          to say this--

                    KATHY
          You're giving Deke the gold shield.

                    HAWK
          I have to Kathy. He has seniority.

Kathy shakes her head, deeply disappointed.

                    HAWK (CONT'D)
          You deserve the promotion. You should be
          a detective and if we had more openings--

                    KATHY
          That gold shield was the first one in
          four years... Sir... I'm going to have to
          resign, and take that position overseas.
                                                              TWB 6.


                        HAWK
              I think that's a mistake. I want you on
              my team.

    Kathy sighs, touched. But...

                        KATHY
              Frank, I'm nearly forty. I can't be on
              the streets much longer. Not if I don't
              know there's something on the other end.

    She looks up at Hawk, but he's staring past her at...

    The door. Kathy turns, seeing... A young, scared GIRL, 15.
    This is ERIN. Kathy's daughter. She's heard everything. Hawk
    eyes Erin, sympathetic.

                        HAWK
              Just think about it, will you?

    He leaves, passing Erin, who pushes down tears. Kathy eyes
    Erin, full of love, but not knowing what to say.

9   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER                                         9

    Erin stares out the window. Kathy watches her, concerned.

                        ERIN
              I wish you could stay here.

                           KATHY
              Me too.

    Erin turns. Serious. Weighing...

                        ERIN
              I mean it's fine living at dad's, but...
              Now I really won't see you for a while.

                        KATHY
              I'm doing this for us. If I have a better
              job, I can give you guys more.

    Erin nods, tearing again.

                        ERIN
              When do you have to decide?

                           KATHY
              Come here.

    Erin moves over, hesitant. Kathy pulls her in to a hug,
    wincing slightly in pain. But keeps a brave face.
                                                            TWB 7.


                         ERIN
               Are you sure it's not dangerous?

                         KATHY
               Of course. It's been four years. Things
               are getting back to normal over there.

                                                     SMASH CUT TO:

     A BOMBED OUT building, sprayed with RED GRAFFITI. DEBRIS
     everywhere. Torn clothes. A SIGN. Cyrillic letters:

     SARAJEVO - 3 KM.

     Sprayed across it in red: TURN AROUND!

     Kathy sits in a bus full of BLUE BERETS. She looks out the
     window, her eyes drinking it all in...

                         VOICE (O.S.)
               You come here today as a beacon of hope,
               as representatives of humanity's highest
               aspirations.

     In the opposite direction, a U.S. MILITARY TANK ROLLS past. A
     SOLDIER looks out from the HATCH.

     Kathy turns to see the only other woman on the bus, Carmen,
     20s, Latina. She smiles cheekily, giving Kathy the `peace'
     sign. Kathy smiles. IMMEDIATE SOLIDARITY.

     In the opposite direction, two other UN BUSES pass, one
     flanked by a CANADIAN FLAG, the other with a FRENCH TRICOLOR.

     The bus cranks around the corner, entering...

12   EXT. SNIPER ALLEY - CONTINUOUS                                12

     The final stretch into Sarajevo. Famous from so many war
     reports, site of many deaths. The broad, pock-marked avenue
     is barren. SHELLED HIGH RISES lean like hungry faces, gouged
     from their once-solid structures. Living rooms are exposed to
     the elements, wallpaper blowing in the wind like torn skin.
                                                             TWB 8.

                          CARMEN
               Sniper Alley. See, the bullet marks are
               at eye level. People just running to the
               store.

     All the walls are splattered at head level. Kathy is overcome
     by the stark reality of war. Worse than she ever imagined.

                                                   INTERCUT WITH:

13   INT. MEETING HALL - LATER                                      13

     BILL HYNES paces before the assembled NEW RECRUITS. He's in
     his 50s, distinguished and seemingly in charge...

     The refugees turn their haunted eyes to the fresh faces of
     the NEW RECRUITS. Kathy extends a parcel to an OLD MAN. He
     hesitates. Then she sees... He has no arms. She's unsure what
     to do. A young boy takes the package, leading his grandfather
     away. Kathy stands: WHERE AM I?

               The Dayton Peace Accords of 1995 ended
               this war, dictating that an International
               Police Task Force - YOU - would smooth
               the transition from war to peace.

15   EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF SARAJEVO - DAY                               15

     KATHY and THREE NEW RECRUITS are led down a path along a
     mountainside. They move toward an UNDERGROUND BUNKER.
     CHILDREN play at the edge of an overgrown field.

     A BOY hops up on a post, about to jump over, when the leader,
     TODD MYERS, 30s, a seasoned pro, YELLS at him, points out...

     A sign closer to the BARBED WIRE, fringing the field... A
     SKULL AND CROSSBONES. "LANDMINES NOT SWEPT"

                         BILL HYNES (O.S.)
               But you will learn that peace is harder
               won than war..

     Kathy watches the boy run back up the road. The recruits head
     down STEEP STEPS into...

16   INT. ARTILLERY DEPOSIT - MOMENTS LATER                         16

     Light sneaks through cracks, catching on the oil black
     barrels of THOUSANDS of GUNS. Todd hands out BINDERS.

                         TODD MYERS
               We are still in the process of disarming
               the Muslim, Croat, and Serb militias. You
               will be cataloguing these arms for
               decommissioning records.

     Kathy eyes the unending stash of GUNS.

17   EXT. SARAJEVO SUBURBS - DUSK                                   17

     Kathy drives past a MILITARY BASE, an ITALIAN FLAG flying...
     A few hundred yards up the street, a BAR...

     BELLA LUNA BAR

     Driving past a another BAR. GERMAN FLAG... A SIGN: BERLIN
     NIGHTS... Kathy passes by, amused.

18   EXT. AMERICAN DORMS - SARAJEVO SUBURBS - EVENING               18

     Kathy and Carmen are led by a MONITOR through a sparsely
     furnished UNIT. A poster of `Born in the USA' on the wall.
                                                              TWB 10.


                         BILL HYNES (O.S.)
               You will learn that every morning's
               hope...

     Carmen bounces her butt up and down to test her mattress.

19   INT. LOCAL GROCERY STORE - DAY                                 19

     Kathy inspects items on the shelves. Nothing familiar.

     MOVING POV FROM BUS - EARLIER

     A cluster of WOMEN in BLACK BURKAS. They sway like reeds in
     the wind, grief overcoming them as they watch:

                         BILL HYNES (O.S.)
               ...is haunted by yesterday's nightmare...

     UN BLUE HELMETS supervise the dig of a mass grave. Bodies are
     revealed. A child's shoe is uncovered. A BURLY PEACEKEEPER
     turns, sickened.

20   EXT. TITO BARRACKS - AFTERNOON                                 20

     The bus arrives. The base is surrounded by barbed wire and
     overlook sights, manned by ARMED MILITARY.

     MEETING HALL: Hynes looks out at the new batch. Proud.

                         BILL HYNES
               But today is a new day. As Head of the
               United Nations Mission here I trust that
               we stake our highest values, even our
               lives, on the belief that we can rebuild,
               we must renew, we will witness the
               rebirth of this country.

     The recruits are hyped, the rhetoric is working. MOVING OVER
     THEM, MAN by MAN, we REVEAL in the back:

     Kathy. In her crisp navy blue IPTF flack jacket. Her blonde
     hair makes her stand out. She is one of the only women in the
     room. Her eyes ablaze. She is completely fired up.

21   INT. KITCHEN - IPTF DORM - EVENING                             21

     Kathy sits at the table spreading stuff on dark bread. Carmen
     across from her. Kathy takes a bite and grimaces.

                         KATHY
               I thought this was peanut butter but--
                                                           TWB 11.


                         CARMEN
               It's ass paste? I know. I bought it too.
               Let's get out of here. I need a drink.

22   EXT. STREET - SARAJEVO - NIGHT                               22

     ROCK MUSIC ECHOES from several bars. Carmen heads toward one,
     when an AMERICAN IPTF MONITOR stops her.

                         AMERICAN IPTF
               That's a military Bar. You want the party
               in there...

     He points to BIG NEON SIGN: THE INTERNATIONAL BAR. Tiki
     lights illuminate a broad patio. A PIG roasts on a spit.

     Kathy follows Carmen through DOZENS of off-duty IPTF, SFOR
     and UN workers who drink and trade stories with machismo.

     There's a palpable sexual tension in the air. BOSNIAN
     WAITRESSES flirt with OFFICERS. Guys paw GIRLS with trays.

                         CARMEN
               Fuck me, we're outnumbered. Good odds.

                         KATHY
               Hon, they're all yours.

     They make their way through the crowded bar, feeling the
     officers' double-takes. Carmen smiles coyly at Kathy, then
     zeroes in on JAN VAN DER VELDE, 35, handsome. He is
     surrounded by a group of IPTF with Dutch flags on their
     shoulders. Carmen throws her arms around them, jovial.

                         CARMEN
               Okay, fine, if you insist. Mine's a
               Jaegermeister.

     Jan laughs at Carmen's forwardness, his eye on Kathy. But she
     spots Todd Myers across the bar, and is on her way, when...

                         JAN
               What about you? You don't have an order?

                         KATHY
               No. I'm the polite one.

                         JAN
               I like polite.

     Carmen turns his head toward her.
                                                         TWB 12.


                       CARMEN
             I'm gonna be the drunk one. Let's get
             toasted.

Kathy smiles, a little too old for this game. Carmen leans
into Kathy's ear. She smiles, and moves off.

AT THE BAR

Kathy moves to Todd and the Americans, catching Todd's eye,
but is distracted by a WAITRESS writhing on an ITALIAN
SOLDIER's lap. The Waitress darts Kathy a look, contemptuous.
And the soldiers notice. One leers at Kathy...

                       ITALIAN SOLDIER
             I'd pay double for a woman in uniform.

Kathy looks him over.

                       KATHY
             Sorry pal, I'm not for sale.

The Soldier is stung. The Italians laugh.

                       TODD MYERS (O.S.)
             We're Dyncorp. We're all for sale...
             Kathy, right?

Todd puts his arm around Kathy, bringing her to a TABLE OF
AMERICAN IPTF. They greet her, friendly.

                       TODD MYERS (CONT'D)
             Look the basic lay of the land is we have
             to work with the other nationals, but we
             don't mix with them at night.

JIM HIGGINS, 25, and even younger looking...

                       JIM HIGGINS
             Lucky those wops don't carry guns or
             we'd've had ourselves a situation.
             Fucking unarmed mission. I was hoping
             we'd get to squeeze some off.

                       TODD MYERS
             At who? Better odds you'll step on a land
             mine and what the hell's a gun gonna do
             for you then?

                        JIM HIGGINS
             (embarrassed) I'd kill the fucker who
             buried it.

Everyone laughs. Todd turns to Kathy.
                                                             TWB 13.


                         TODD MYERS
               You ever had to take someone down?

                            KATHY
               Just once.

     The others see she's the real deal. Kathy feels good.

23   INT. PATIO BAR - LATE NIGHT                                   23

     Kathy moves through the now-hopping bar. She's ready to
     leave. She searches for... Carmen. She's IN A CORNER. Still
     with the group of DUTCH OFFICERS.

     Kathy approaches, concerned, when Jan cuts her off. He's
     watching Carmen, who's teetering, drunk.

                          JAN
               You should probably get her home.

                          KATHY
               You probably shouldn't have let her drink
               that much.

     Kathy moves past him, irritated. But he grabs her.

                         JAN
               Hey. I... don't worry. I know those guys.
               Nothing was going to happen to her.

     Kathy shrugs, it doesn't mean much to her.

                         JAN (CONT'D)
               I was hoping you'd come back.

                         KATHY
               Well I did. And now we're both leaving.

24   EXT. SARAJEVO - MORNING                                       24

     Early sun breaks through the fog over the valley.

25   INT. DORM - KITCHEN - MORNING                                 25

     Kathy tries to work the Bosnian coffee maker, a confusing
     relic. Carmen comes in, holding her head.

                         CARMEN
               What the hell happened last night?

     Kathy smiles, pouring her a cup of the tar-like brew. They
     both look at it, a little scared. Kathy eyes the clock.
                                                           TWB 14.


                         KATHY
               Let's move. We're gonna be late.

26   EXT. STREET - ILIDZA, BOSNIA - DAY                             26

     Industrial plants dominate the skyline of this Sarajevo
     suburb. Kathy drives frantically past bombed-out buildings.
     Carmen studies a map beside her. They hit A RED LIGHT. And
     stop. A GROUP OF MUSLIM WOMEN cross the street. One questions
     Kathy with a lingering gaze. Carmen stares at her map...

                         CARMEN
               Do you have any idea where we are?

     Kathy shakes her head. No idea.

27   INT. ILIDZA STATION - MOMENTS LATER                            27

     A run-down prefab office, with dated 80s equipment. A couple
     of small offices off the open center.

     Kathy and Carmen rush in. An IPTF OFFICER stands waiting for
     them... Jan Van Der Velde.

                         JAN
               Late night ladies?

     They eye him, embarrassed. He hands them each a thick binder.

                         JAN (CONT'D)
               I'm your duty officer. You check the duty
               roster. Every day. You're each assigned
               to monitor and instruct a group of
               Bosnian local police. We work in six week
               shifts. You instruct in the mornings,
               then go into the field with them in the
               afternoon. One of you needs to go now.

     He eyes an eager Kathy. Carmen shrugs.

                         JAN (CONT'D)
               They're waiting at the 5th canton. Out
               the gate, then left, left, park, right...

     Kathy rushes off, then stops. Jan tosses a set of keys.

                         JAN (CONT'D)
               My van. There's a map in front.

     She drops the keys, grabs them, and rushes out.

28   EXT. 5TH CANTON - ILIDZA, BOSNIA - MORNING                     28

     A SCHOOL sprayed with GRAFFITI and BULLETS.
                                                           TWB 15.


29   INT. CLASSROOM - MORNING                                       29

     An abandoned CLASSROOM. Shabby corkboards with yellowing PSA
     posters, ragged kids' drawings, and tired sticky tape.

     Kathy skims through the training binders. The DOOR OPENS and
     a GROUP OF LOCAL POLICE file in. They whisper, exchanging
     lascivious glances. Kathy straightens her uniform.

                         KATHY
               Feel free to sit wherever you like.

     Kathy waits for them to take their seats. They don't. A
     BOSNIAN WOMAN, pretty, rushes in. Spotting Kathy...

                         BOSNIAN WOMAN
               Sorry I am late. I'm your interpreter.

                         KATHY
               Great, well... I just asked them to sit.

     The interpreter shakes her head benignly. They take their
     seats. The interpreter looks at Kathy.

                         BOSNIAN WOMAN
               They like to be difficult. They
               understand if you're clear. Mostly they
               have trouble speaking English. But let's
               see if you can get them to talk at all.

     Kathy looks out, suddenly daunted. She presses on, opening
     her binder as authoritatively as she can.

                         KATHY
               Okay, I'm going to be talking about crime
               scene investigation today. If we could--

     An older officer, DANIK, stands, defiant.

                         DANIK (BROKEN ENGLISH)
               Where do we sign to say we came?

                         KATHY
               Actually, you sign the attendance at the
               end of the session. It's a UN mandate--

                         DANIK
               Or we sign now?

     Full of malice. Kathy puts the sheet away, then...

                         KATHY
               We sign later.
                                                              TWB 16.


     The cop scoffs, and sits.

30   INT. CLASSROOM - LATER                                         30

     Kathy stands in front of a BLACKBOARD with DRAWINGS on a
     CRIME SCENE. She crosses off TWO AREAS on the board.

                         KATHY
               ...Keeping the crime scene clean is
               number one.

     A weak smile. Nothing from the crowd. She trundles on.

             KATHY (CONT'D)                   INTERPRETER
     Remember you could be           Pamyatayte scho vu bu mholy

     bag. We call that 'chain of
     evidence.'

     Kathy looks out. The cops are barely paying attention. ONE
     stubs out a cigarette. Another closes the binder, defiantly.

                         DANIK
               We sign sheet now?

     Kathy leans back, disappointed. She hands him the sheet. They
     all sign, apathetic.

                         DANIK (CONT'D)
               You will tell UN we were cooperating?

     Kathy tries to retain a poker face but their indifference
     stings. And just as they're about to leave...

                         KATHY
               We have to go to the hospital together.

     The cops eye her, agitated.

31   EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY                                            31

     Kathy's SUV pulls up behind the cluster of local police cars.
     IPTF OFFICER CLARKSON stands outside. He eyes his watch.
     Kathy rushes to him, but he's already a foot in the door.

                         KATHY
               We got here as quick as we could.

     Clarkson leads Kathy and the BOSNIAN POLICE through the hall.
     Gurney's and IVs suggest it's a hospital, but you wouldn't
     want to be examined here. Some windows are still covered with
     wood slats, and paint barely covers old bullet holes. The
     floors still hold the stains of old blood.

     Clarkson grabs a file, and speaks without looking back...

                         CLARKSON
               Seems we have two stabbings, one
               shooting, and a man with a broken leg and
               a bad hangover who can't remember what
               happened... Average night back in
               Brighton.

     The cops stare at him, lost. As they file into a SMALL ROOM
     filled with tightly drawn curtains. They all squeeze into the
     center together. Kathy is pressed against the large cop.

     Clarkson pulls back a curtain, revealing...

     ZLATA SEHIK, 40, Muslim. Her face is covered with wounds. She
     avoids the gaze of the police who stare with contempt. She
     pulls her bed-sheet up to her chin as...

                         CLARKSON (CONT'D)
               (reading chart) "facial contusions from
               repeated beatings with fist",
               "lacerations on the eye caused by the
               edge of an iron"...

     He pauses. Looking at Zlata, he moves her sheet up to expose
     her leg. Zlata's eyes tear. Clarkson reads...

                         CLARKSON (CONT'D)
               "The right hand was the first entry point
               of a large kitchen knife"... "The second
               entry point in the upper left thigh"...
               It went through her hand and into her
               leg... Who's going to take this report?

     Kathy looks out at the Bosnian cops, but they stare at the
     ground. One cop peeks into the next cubicle. Kathy looks at
     Clarkson for a cue. He holds out the clipboard.

                           CLARKSON (CONT'D)
               Anyone?

     No answer. Clarkson looks to Kathy to take control. She turns
     to her group, but they have even less respect for her. She
     goes to speak, when... VIKO, 25, looks up, hesitant.
                                                             TWB 18.


                         VIKO (BROKEN ENGLISH)
               I will take it.

     The cops turn. Clarkson unclicks his pen. Viko sees Kathy,
     hungry for support. But Danik scoffs.

                         DANIK (BOSNIAK)
               (At Zlata) Tze ye yiyiy vuna.

     Zlata's face tightens. Viko turns to Danik, angry.... Kathy
     looks to Clarkson, who gives her nothing.

                         KATHY
               What did he say?

                         VIKO
               She is Muslim. He said she deserved it.

                         CLARKSON
               Alright, that's it. Everyone out.

                          KATHY
               (at Clarkson) Isn't she filing a
               complaint?

     The other cops eye Kathy, defiant. This is our turf.

     Clarkson ushers the cops out. Kathy catches Viko's eye.
     Simpatico. Then follows the other out. Kathy looks back at
     Zlata, who lies helpless.

33   INT. HALLWAY - HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER                       33

     Clarkson leads the group. Kathy pushes up toward him.

                         KATHY
               She has to file a complaint. A woman gets
               stabbed in the face and there are no
               repercussions?

     Clarkson pulls Kathy aside. Viko stares.

                         CLARKSON
               Quit it! You hear me?

     Kathy reddens. The local cops look over.

                         CLARKSON (CONT'D)
               We are not investigators. We are
               monitors. You don't know a Serb from a
               Croat or a Bosniak. You've got ethnic
               hatreds that started a war. This isn't
               just policing, it's diplomacy.
                                                              TWB 19.


     Kathy blushes, feeling like a chastened schoolgirl.

                         CLARKSON (CONT'D)
               We don't run the show, we make sure the
               show runs smoothly.

34   INT. BEDROOM - IPTF DORM - EVENING                             34

     Kathy sits up in bed reading from her Dyncorp/UN manual. She
     flicks, not finding what she's looking for. Carmen comes out
     of her room, dolled up for the evening.

                         CARMEN
               Come out. You can't solve this tonight.
               I'm not taking no for an answer.

35   EXT. LOCAL CAFE - SARAJEVO MARKET - NIGHT                      35

     Kathy has dinner with Carmen, who talks away. Kathy watches
     the world go by. She notices an OLDER, LARGE IPTF MONITOR
     walking with his arm around a YOUNG GIRL, 16, dressed in a
     short skirt. Kathy turns back to Carmen who is still talking.

36   EXT. SARAJEVO - MORNING                                        36

     Chanting echoes from the SINANOVA HOUSE of the Dervish Order.

37   INT. ILIDZA STATION - MORNING                                  37

     Viko comes in, scanning over IPTF MONITORS. Spotting Kathy.

38   INT. ILIDZA STATION - MOMENTS LATER                            38

     Viko lays down a pile of files. Zlata's picture on top.

                         VIKO
               Zlata Sehik has been to the hospital
               eight time because of her husband. Every
               time she try to file a complaint, my
               bosses send her back. They always laugh
               at the woman... They laughed at my
               mother. They do not make prosecutions of
               domestic violence. I want to get enough
               evidence to do this.

     Kathy isn't sure. She looks around, almost guiltily...

                         VIKO (CONT'D)
               This is why you are here, no?

     Kathy looks at him, struck by the truth of this. She takes
     the files, flipping through them. Thinking...
                                                           TWB 20.


                         KATHY
               With no police reports?.. Maybe, if you
               go back to the hospital... You can pull
               the records for every one of her visits.

39   INT. FILE ROOM - HOSPITAL - DAY                               39

     A HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATOR, who hands Viko a stack of files.

40   EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY                                           40

     Kathy sits in a UN SUV. Viko watches as she goes through
     Zlata's hospital files. She's encouraged.

                         KATHY
               Okay, now get the same thing from all the
               doctors who treated her. They will have
               to testify on Zlata's behalf.

41   INT. LAW LIBRARY - EVENING                                    41

     Viko and Kathy sit behind a pile of Legal Books. Viko shows
     Kathy a page, a questioning look on his face.

                         KATHY
               This is good. Let's cross reference each
               injury with other cases where felony
               assaults were ruled. Can you get
               something like that?

     Viko turns to see a LIBRARIAN at the main desk.

                         KATHY (CONT'D)
               ... Because if stabbing someone in a bar
               is illegal then the same standard can be
               applied to a domestic assault.

42   INT. COURTHOUSE - DAY                                         42

     Viko sits behind Zlata and COUNSEL while a JUDGE rules.

                         KATHY (O.S.)
               If an attorney presents this properly,
               referencing international standards, you
               might be able to get a conviction.

     Viko and Zlata wait... then breathe relief. They won. Viko
     turns TO THE BACK OF THE COURTROOM: Kathy smiles, at last
     feeling they can really accomplish something.

43   INT. JAN'S OFFICE - ILIDZA STATION - DAY                      43

     Kathy comes inside, interrupting Jan and FRANZ, Dutch IPTF.
                                                              TWB 21.


                         KATHY
               Sorry, you wanted to see me?

     Franz excuses himself, eyeing a tense Kathy. Jan closes the
     door behind Franz, turning to Kathy. All business.

                         JAN
               Madeleine Rees wants to see you. Head of
               the Office of the United Nations High
               Commissioner for Human Rights.

                            KATHY
               What? Why?

                         JAN
               I'm sure it's fine. You followed
               protocol, right?

     Kathy rushes out, worried. Jan smiles, in on a secret.

44   INT. MADELEINE REES' OFFICE - SARAJEVO - MORNING               44

     Kathy sits alone in the office. Degrees, plaques, and awards
     cover the walls. Pictures of Madeleine Rees with Kofi Annan,
     Bill Clinton, Nelson Mandela... Kathy is intimidated.

     MADELEINE REES, 50s, tall, commanding, short blonde hair,
     British. She sashays in with a DOBERMAN on a leash.

                         MADELEINE REES
               Don't mind Helen, she's a total sap.

     Kathy eyes the malevolent hound.

                         KATHY
               Ms. Rees, I--

                         MADELEINE REES
               Madeleine. You've been stirring things
               up.

                         KATHY
               Is this about Zlata Sehik? If I've
               overstepped protocol--

                         MADELEINE REES
               You have done in two months, what we've
               been trying to do for years.

     Madeleine sits. Kathy straightens.
                                                           TWB 22.


                         MADELEINE REES (CONT'D)
               All due respect to Viko Mezovic, but you
               just facilitated the first conviction for
               domestic abuse in Bosnian history. I'm
               bloody impressed. So is the Dutch Duty
               Officer who recommended you.

     Kathy takes it in. Madeleine looks out the window at TWO
     GLASS TOWERS that punctuate Sarajevo's skyline.

                         MADELEINE REES (CONT'D)
               The IPTF has a Gender Affairs Office at
               Mission Headquarters. Dervla Hughes, the
               current head, is leaving and I think
               you're the right person to take over.

     Kathy is taken aback.

                         MADELEINE REES (CONT'D)
               You'd be overseeing 12 regional offices.
               Any gender reports come through you. This
               involves anything from equality training
               to domestic and child abuse cases,
               fallout from war crimes against women,
               prostitution. Women in Bosnia are treated
               like second class citizens. You could
               have a real impact on their lives. What
               do you think? Are you interested?

     This is everything Kathy came to do...

                         KATHY
               Absolutely.

45   INT. BEDROOM - IPTF DORM - NIGHT                            45

     Kathy paces, phone to her ear. Her suitcase open, she's
     packing at the same time. Carmen helps.

                         KATHY (INTO PHONE)
               I know hon, it's very exciting. If this
               works out. It's a real opportunity for
               the future, but it means I have to, I
               have to extend my contract for another
               six months... Hello?..

     Kathy stops pacing.

                           KATHY (CONT'D)
               ...Erin?

     Kathy pulls the phone close, listening. Carmen eyes her.

                         KATHY (CONT'D)
               No I didn't. I'll look right now.

     Kathy goes over to a computer, clicking open an EMAIL. ON THE
     SCREEN: A PICTURE OF ERIN in a PROM DRESS. Kathy sits back,
     flushed with emotion. Her enthusiasm complicated by the
     realization of what she's missing back home. Softly...

                         KATHY (CONT'D)
               You look beautiful...

               I can't believe they're moving you into
               the city. I'm so jealous. So where's your
               office?

                         KATHY
               Mission Headquarters... UNMHQ.

                         CARMEN
               But Madeleine is UNHCHR, right?

                         KATHY
               (smiling) I know. I don't even know if
               I'm still IPTF.

                         CARMEN
               Well I don't give an F.U.C.K. All I know
               is I'm gonna miss you. Stay in touch with
               the little people!

     They hug. Kathy smiles, and hops into the car.

47   EXT. SARAJEVO ROAD - NIGHT                                     47

     Kathy puts the last box down. She steps out onto the balcony.
     Looks out at Sarajevo, city of survivors, her new home.

49   EXT. UN MISSION HEADQUARTERS (UNMHQ) - SARAJEVO - MORNING      49

     Member nations' flags slap in the wind. Hundreds of UN SUVs.
     Kathy drives up. She takes in the huge building. Almost in
     disbelief that she's part of it, at the center of it all.
                                                           TWB 24.


50   INT. LOBBY - UNMHQ - MORNING                                   50

     The modern lobby buzzes with UN OFFICIALS and DIPLOMATS.
     Kathy follows RICK JONES, 30s, athletic, crisp.

                         RICK JONES
               I'm glad to have an American in the mix.
               You'll be reporting to me.

                         KATHY
               Oh... I, I thought I was reporting to
               Madeleine Rees' Office.

                         RICK JONES
               It's a joint office. She's Human Rights.
               But you're Police Task Force. So you go
               through me. But we all report to Bill
               Hynes anyhow.

     They walk through two large doors into... The Inner Sanctum.

51   INT. CORRIDOR - UNMHQ - CONTINUOUS                             51

     Rick and Kathy round a corner to a medium-sized office, boxes
     everywhere. Rick eyes the... mess.

                         RICK JONES
               Yeah, your ah... predecessor's files...
               We're waiting for Archives to get those
               out of here. I'll put another call in.

     Kathy nods, taking in the disarray. Dust sits on the stacks
     of boxes, on papers and files strewn about.

                         KATHY
               It's fine. Thanks for the tour.

                         RICK JONES
               Great. I'll leave you to it. Good luck.

     He leaves her. Kathy runs her eye over the place. The reality
     of her office less exalted than she imagined. But she's
     raring to go. She eyes a name plate:

     KATHRYN BOLKOVAC - HEAD OF GENDER AFFAIRS.

     Kathy stands in her office doorway, glancing up the hall.

     THE HALL is empty. The EXIT door at the end swings shut in
     the flickering fluorescent light.

52   EXT. OLD TOWN TURKISH QUARTER - SARAJEVO - NIGHT               52

     Black cobbles. Merchants line the narrow pathways. Open-
     doored cafes serve coffee to UNEMPLOYED YOUTH. Kathy and Jan
     walk along. He's delighted. She's restrained.

                         JAN
               I was wondering when you'd ask me out.

                         KATHY
               It's not a date... No, seriously. It's
               not. I know you had a lot to do with my
               promotion, so I wanted to thank you.

     He grabs her by the hand, ducking into a SMALL ARCHWAY. A
     NARROW PASSAGE opens up onto a charming restaurant.

53   EXT. CAFE - OLD TOWN - LATER                                   53

     Kathy and Jan sit at a table, watching a WAITRESS put down a
     carraffe of wine and 'Cevapcici' (lamb dish).

                         JAN
               Here's to not dating.

                         KATHY
               Listen to me. I'm not joking around.
               You're a nice guy. But I...

     The waitress reaches across Kathy with a plate. Winks at Jan.

                         WAITRESS
               You are certain you have everything you
               need?

     The waitress eyes him coyly. Kathy studies the exchange.

                         JAN
               We're fine thank you.

     The waitress leaves. Kathy shakes her head, amused.

                         JAN (CONT'D)
               You were saying I'm a nice guy--

     Kathy is watching the waitress hit up another table.

                         KATHY
               You must be in heaven over here.

                         KATHY
               You don't find that--

                         JAN
               I find it uncomfortable. A lot of guys
               don't. I don't know what else to say
               about it. Now finish your sentence, I'm a
               nice guy but--

                         KATHY
               I can't afford to mess this up.

                         JAN
               It's only dinner. How bad can it get?

                         KATHY
               Ask my two ex-husbands.

     He grins. Kathy looks at him, unsettled by the chemistry
     between them.

54   INT. CORRIDOR - UNMHQ - DAY                                   54

     Rick introduces Kathy to various IPTF and UN colleagues.

55   INT. KATHY'S OFFICE - UNMHQ - DAY                             55

     Kathy stacks unpacked boxes out of the way. She organizes a
     BIG BULLETIN BOARD into 12 CANTONS.

56   EXT. EIGHTH CANTON - AFTERNOON                                56

     Kathy follows an IPTF monitor, BARRY, 30s, Irish past the
     front of a UN BUS. A DOZEN MUSLIM WOMEN disembark and look
     up, their hands over their mouths, keening.

                         BARRY
               This is the first time they've seen their
               homes in years.

     IPTF MONITORS help with unloading battered suitcases and
     belongings. THREE carry a couch up the steps of a building as
     a YOUNG BROTHER and SISTER watch. Standing back, an ELDERLY
     WOMAN weeps in disbelief as the monitors lay final touches on
     makeshift storm windows on her aparment.

     Kathy watches, Barry by her side.

                         KATHY
               They're all widows?

                          BARRY
               That's why they were so frightened to
               come back.

                         BARRY (CONT'D)
               They couldn't believe they'd be safe.
               That what happened before wouldn't happen
               again. Except now with nobody to protect
               them.

     Kathy shakes her head. The women enter the building, their
     past lives in shards at their feet. One WOMAN, 40s, stands
     numb, a bundle of books in her arms, tears running down her
     face, as her TEENAGE SON beckons her to come in the DOOR.

                            KATHY
               Except us.

                         BARRY
               I always thought helping refugees get
               home would be one of the best parts of
               the job. But it's so hard for them.

     Kathy nods, moved.

                         KATHY
               Thanks for taking me through this. Fill
               me in when you're done, and I'll send my
               report to Rick Jones.

     Another FIELD OFFICER rushes up. An urgent look on his face.

57   INT. IPTF FIELD OFFICE - AFTERNOON                             57

     The field officer leads Barry and Kathy round a corner, to...

     A YOUNG GIRL nearly passed out on the couch. Her face bloody
     and swollen. Kathy runs up to the girl, who can barely sit
     up. Softly waking her. The girl comes to, taking in her
     surroundings, and...

     JUMPS UP. An unmistakable look in her eyes. TERROR.

     Kathy eyes the field worker. He shrugs, lost. Kathy turns
     back to the girl, and slowly places a hand on her shoulder.
     The girl flinches, then inches back... shaking her head.

                         KATHY
               It's okay, it's--

     But the girl holds out her hands, stopping Kathy. She looks
     around, completely disoriented. Desperately searching for an
     exit. She eyes them all, realizing she's surrounded and
     then... SHE WAILS.

     Losing control. Slapping at all of them. Kathy moves to her,
     trying -- gently -- to hold her tight. The girl sobs.
     Hopelessness in her eyes. And then...
                                                      TWB 28.


She faints. Kathy and Barry bend to catch her.

                    KATHY (CONT'D)
          (at field worker) Call a medic!

He rushes off. Kathy and Barry lay the girl down. She lies on
the ground, breathing slowly, looking close to death.

Kathy holds her hand.

                    KATHY (CONT'D)
          Who is she?

                    FIELD WORKER
          I found her out in the woods. She was
          speaking, I don't know, she's not local.
          I think she's one of the girls from the
          bars.

Looking at the girl, Kathy pushes a strand of hair from her
face. And as we stay a moment longer, we realize this is...

Raya. A long way from home. But then...

THE DOORS OPEN. A frantic HUMAN RIGHTS WORKER carries IRKA,
17, into the room. Her clothes torn, her body and face
bruised. Kathy looks up...

                    HUMAN RIGHTS WORKER
          She was further back in the woods.

Irka sees Raya. Sudden relief. Then realizing...

          Florida Bar... Ciysh... Six girl there...

Kathy looks to Barry.

                    BARRY
          It's a bar in the hills.

Kathy shakes her head. She looks at Raya and Irka.

                    BARRY (CONT'D)
          I'll take them to the women's shelter at
          Zenica.

Kathy rummages through her files, catching up.

                    KATHY
          Yeah. Good. I'll follow up at the bar.

Barry shrugs. Kathy's mind is racing.
                                                           TWB 29.

58   INT./ EXT. - UN SUV - DAY                                      58

     Kathy drives up a winding mountain road, checking directions
     on a hand-drawn map. A LOCAL POLICE CAR swerves by in the
     opposite direction.

59   INT. UN SUV/EXT. FLORIDA BAR - DAY                             59

     Kathy's SUV throws up gravel. Out her windscreen, she sees

     THE FLORIDA BAR: A dilapidated two story building, painted a
     garish pink. Crude palm trees painted on the side.

     Kathy jumps out of her SUV, and moves towards...

     LOCAL POLICE smoke by POLICE CARS.

     A LOCAL COP leads a CLUSTER of YOUNG WOMEN out the door. They
     blink in the glaring light, pale, out of place, lost...

     At the end of the line, is Luba. Her eyes darting between
     Kathy and the Local Cops, helpless.

     Kathy rushes towards the cop. He eyes her, dubious.

                         KATHY
               What's going on here?

                         LOCAL COP (SERBIAN)

     He moves past her, with the Girls in tow.

                          KATHY
               Hold on. Where are the IPTF monitoring
               this raid?

     SHOUTING ECHOES from inside the bar. TWO COPS drag out TANJO
     ZRAVBIC, 50s. He sees Kathy's uniform and SHOUTS at her.

               Zra slobovik brvicetic revic barziny
               Traba! Motherfockers!

     The cops SHOVE Tanjo in a car, and SLAM the door. Kathy turns
     to the Local Cop, standing with the group of girls.

                         KATHY
               Is that the owner? Are you taking him
               into custody?

          Is there a translator on the scene?
          Translator?... Wait.

He stops, impatient. Kathy pulls out her WALKIE.

                    KATHY (CONT'D)
          This is Kathy Bolkovac. I need an
          Interpreter. At the Florida Bar.

The Local Cops watch her. Kathy's eyes rest on the girls.

                    WALKIE VOICE (O.S.) (ACCENTED ENGLISH)
          Okay. I need a time and date.

                      KATHY
          Now.

                    WALKIE VOICE (O.S.)
          That's impossible. We need advance notice
          for field calls.

The Local Cop talks at the girls. They don't understand him,
but his tone is clear: total disrespect. Kathy moves toward
them, protectively, then sees...

TWO UN SUVs parked on the other side of the bar.

TWO IPTF MONITORS emerge from the bar. Kathy approaches them.
They seem surprised.

                    KATHY
          Hey. I'm from Gender Affairs. I--

                    FRED MURRAY
          Hey. Fred Murray.

He shakes her hand.

Tanjo BANGS on the window, inside the police car, apopleptic
with rage. Kathy glances over her shoulder.

                    KATHY
          Is that the owner? (off Fred's nod) I
          tried to get an interpreter but--

                    FRED MURRAY
          No, no... that's fine. We're pretty much
          done here anyway.

                         KATHY
               Oh... Okay. But there's... We just had
               two girls come in to a Human Rights
               Office, saying they escaped from this
               place.

     Fred seems confused. Kathy pulls out a clipboard.

                         FRED MURRAY
               Yeah. Local police have been watching the
               place for a while. This whole thing
               happened pretty fast. I guess those girls
               must've run for it.

     Kathy looks over as the girls are put into a van.

                         KATHY
               Well, the girls in our field office
               seemed pretty scared. I should follow up
               with these ones.

     The Local Cops start to move, stubbing out cigarettes,
     getting in cars. The Local Cop shuts the doors of the van.

                         FRED MURRAY
               You can see where they're taking them,
               but I can't intervene. You know the
               drill.

     He shrugs and smiles. Kathy hears the POLICE VAN's engine
     start. Turning to it...

                         KATHY
               Thanks. I'll look out for your report.

     She rushes after the van. Fred eyes Kathy confer with the Van
     driver. He and the other Monitor, drive off.

     Kathy is left alone in the silence. She turns to the bar.

60   INT. FLORIDA BAR - MOMENTS LATER                             60

     Kathy moves inside. The place is rank and dingy. A small
     stage with a POLE in the centre. Tables fanned out around it.
     CUT WIRES hang over the stage.

     THE BAR AREA

     Is filled with PHOTOS: YOUNG GIRLS in various poses with men,
     IPTF SOLDIERS. They range from the illicit to the obscene.

                          KATHY
               Jesus...
                                                              TWB 32.


     Kathy stops on a photo of a NAKED GIRL on stage holding the
     two open wires over her head. Behind her, SOLDIERS applaud.

     Kathy takes down the photo, horrified. Turns it over.
     Scrawled in marker: SARAJEVO FIRECRACKER!

     She turns to the stage. Plugs in one of the wires. A HUZZ of
     electricity. Tiny sparks fly.

     She turns, and under the bar sees... A SAFE, SMASHED OPEN. A
     handful of U.S. bills scattered about. And...

     PASSPORTS. Romanian, Ukrainian, Polish. All for young girls.
     She gathers them, surprised, and stuffs them into her file.

     Her eyes are drawn to a back wall. She stops at a panelled
     door. And pushes. It opens onto...

     STEPS: She shines her flashlight up the dark passage...

     The BEAM of the flashlight finds a DOOR. A glint off metal...
     At the door handle, a large PADLOCK, smashed open. Kathy
     darts the beam over the other TWO DOORS... both equipped with
     PADLOCKS. Smashed.

     Kathy pushes through the first door into...

61   INT. HIDDEN BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS                             61

     Kathy's flashlight over: Hanging BEDSHEETS separate the room
     into cubicles. Putrid mattresses. Condoms on the floor.

     Her eye catches MARKINGS UNDER A MATTRESS. She pulls it away.
     And sees GIRLS' NAMES scratched into the floor... Under each
     name, etched in, a list of amounts: 50, 100, 30, 200, 20...
     Some kind of RECORD.

     Kathy PULLS back other mattresses. Dust. Some FAMILY PHOTOS.
     And... a ragged PIECE OF PAPER: Crude drawings of sexual
     positions. A NUMBER by each one: $20, $30, $50, $100, $200...

     The amounts correspond exactly with the table on the floor.

     Kathy looks around, sickened.

62   EXT. WOMEN'S MEDICA SHELTER - SARAJEVO SUBURBS - NIGHT         62

     A run-down Community Center nestled in a shabby area outside
     the city. It's completely unassuming. From the outside, you
     might think it was abandoned.
                                                             TWB 33.


63   INT. HALLWAY - WOMEN'S MEDICA SHELTER - MOMENTS LATER         63

     The shelter is a converted gymnasium. Peeling wallpaper. Long-
     forgotten notices from before the war, postcards. Patchy
     linoleum curls at the edges. A soft hum. Voices in rooms that
     Kathy can't see. She walks down the hall with MILENA, 40s,
     Bosnian, down-to-earth, forthright.

                         MILENA (ACCENTED ENGLISH)

               bought and must repay the debt. They are
               told an outrageous sum, thinking they'll
               be let go when they earn back that money.
               But they never are.

     Kathy stares at her, taken aback.

                         MILENA (CONT'D)
               Sex trafficking is one of the worst
               things to happen after this war.

     Milena hands over a medical report.

                         MILENA (CONT'D)
               Raya has a severe internal infection. The
               doctor found (reading) "intentionally
               placed foreign objects causing a
               disruption of the vaginal wall".

                         KATHY
               Foreign objects?

                         MILENA
               Coins. She's not the first. Men can feel
               deficient paying for sex, so they find
               other ways to feel powerful.

     Milena pushes through a door. To a DARK HALLWAY...

     Hanging bulbs flicker intermittently. They walk. Avoiding
     dripping leaks in the roof.

                         MILENA (CONT'D)
               We gave her Penicillin, but the doctor is
               worried there could be something more
               serious.

                         KATHY
               When will he know?

     They pass an EATING AREA. TEEN GIRLS sit, pick at food, chain-
     smoke and flip through magazines. They are clean, but weak.
                                                         TWB 34.


                    MILENA
          Unfortunately that's all we can do for
          her. We're just a volunteer organization.

Kathy stares at the girls, the sheer number of them...

                    KATHY
          But if there are so many victims.

                    MILENA
          We lost our funding because of those.

...She points at a basket of CONDOMS near the coffee.

                    MILENA (CONT'D)
          It's the U.S. Department of State. They
          have their rules. I'll do anything to
          give these girls some protection. But the
          Department of State thinks "Condoms
          encourage prostitution." NGOs caught
          giving them out, no longer receive US
          funding.

                    KATHY
          But these girls aren't prostitutes.

Milena shrugs.

                    MILENA
          They don't realize the cycle they start. If
          there are no condoms in the bars...

They pass a ROOM DIVIDER. Seeing... MORE GIRLS. IN THEIR
TEENS. All broken. And desperate.

                     MILENA (CONT'D)
          ...the guys want to find ways of avoiding
          STDs. AIDS. Their solution? Pay more for
          virgins...

Kathy sees A GIRL sit in a corner. She couldn't be more than
TEN YEARS OLD. She sits alone.

                    MILENA (CONT'D)
          So the traffickers bring more in. Younger
          and younger. Now it's a global industry.
          Simple economics. If there is demand, you
          supply.

Milena opens a DOOR, revealing... INSIDE THE ROOM: A
VOLUNTEER NURSE sits by Raya's bed. She lies asleep. IN
ANOTHER BED: Irka sleeps. Kathy watches. Hushed...

                         KATHY
               Where can they get help?

                         MILENA
               Try the Global Displacement Agency. They
               have good medical care, lots of funding.
               They might take them. Whether they'll
               keep them or not... I don't know.

                         KATHY
               Where are the other girls from the
               Florida bar?

     Milena looks at her. Blank.

                         KATHY (CONT'D)
               The local police were bringing them here.

                         MILENA
               Those girls never arrived.

     Kathy walks in. Carmen sits behind a desk, piled with files.

                         CARMEN
               Hey, where've you been?

                          KATHY
               I'll tell you about it over a drink.
               Could you just check something for me? I
               want to get a copy of the monitor's
               report from a raid on the Florida Bar
               yesterday.

     Carmen nods, and clicks on her computer.

                         CARMEN
               Your job is so exciting. The only thing I
               get to raid is the fridge. (Reading off
               the computer)... You sure there was a
               raid? There's no record here.

                         KATHY
               No. That's definitely it. There were six
               girls removed from the bar and I need to
               know where they were taken.

                         CARMEN
               Sorry. No record of any raid.

     Kathy thinking. Something's not adding up.

66   INT. CORRIDOR/OFFICE - UNMHQ - MORNING                         66

     Kathy walks. MONITORS greet her as she passes. She reaches an
     OFFICE, and knocks.

                         KATHY
               I'm looking for Fred Murray?

67   EXT. MINE FIELD - BOSNIAN COUNTRYSIDE - DAY                    67

     FIVE local MEN in fatigues scan the field slowly with hand-
     held minesweepers. One MAN holds up his hand as his device
     BEEPS. At the edge of the field, Fred Murray blows a whistle.
     Everybody else STOPS. The man bends down, as all wait...

     Kathy approaches from the road, behind a fence. Fred smiles.

                         FRED MURRAY
               We meet again!

     Kathy looks out, suddenly aware of the dangerous situation.

                         KATHY
               Is it okay for me to be here?

                         FRED MURRAY
               Sure, sure. You're fine here on the
               gravel. What's going on?

                         KATHY
               I just wanted to follow up with you on
               the raid yesterday. Those girls didn't
               show up at the Shelter, and I wanted to
               locate them.

                         FRED MURRAY
               Yeah, the whole thing was a bit of a
               mess. Turned out it was a local police
               mistake. Mix-up with the tip off or
               something. Thought they had a
               prostitution bust, but the bar is legit
               and those girls were just waitresses.

                         KATHY
               Waitresses aren't kept under lock and
               key.

     ANOTHER WHISTLE BLOWS. Fred turns to the field.
                                                           TWB 37.


                         FRED MURRAY
               Shit. Can we go over this later? I got to
               get in there.

     Before she can answer, Fred is moving down the field. She
     watches him go.

70   INT. GLOBAL DISPLACEMENT AGENCY - MOMENTS LATER                70

     Kathy and the girls sit in the waiting area. The place is
     modern, western... corporate. In platinum base relief over
     the reception desk:

     GLOBAL DISPLACEMENT AGENCY.

     The LOBBY. Magazines on a coffee table. The wall adorned with
     a HUGE FRAMED POSTER of a young girl in a spiderweb. A
     caption: "TRAFFIKU ZHINOK YE SPRAV. 1999"

     Kathy scans the hall. Endless posters. 1998, 1997, 1996...

     LAURA LEVIN, 30s, American, groomed, business-like, comes
     around the corner. Her ASSISTANT, 20s, leads the girls away.

                         KATHY
               Kathy. The new Head of Gender Affairs.

               I heard. Laura Levin. My assistant will
               take them to the medical center. As soon
               as they get medical clearance we'll know
               where we stand.

                         KATHY
               What do you mean?

                         LAURA LEVIN
               Well, it's yet to be determined if
               they'll cooperate with the repatriation
               program. That's the only way I can allow
               them to stay at the GDA.

                         KATHY
               They're critical... witnesses for a
               situation I'm... monitoring. I'll need to
               speak with them when they're ready.

                         LAURA LEVIN
               I understand. I'll be in touch.

                         KATHY
               Will you be contacting their parents?

     Laura nods. Something still on Kathy's mind...

                         KATHY (CONT'D)
               The other girls from the raid were
               supposed to go to the Women's Medica
               Shelter, but they never showed up. Do you
               have any idea where else they might have
               been taken?

                         LAURA LEVIN
               I didn't know there were any others.

     Kathy in the doorway. The place is dark but lit by lamps
     along the walls. MUSIC pumps. The place is hopping. A
     scantily-clad GIRL dances on the stage, her body writhing but
     her eyes dead. Along the edges, girls - the very SAME GIRLS
     Kathy saw released at the raid - 'socialize' with customers.

     Many of the CUSTOMERS... in IPTF UNIFORMS, others with off-
     duty IPTF SWEATSHIRTS, and INTERNATIONALS in civilian
     casuals. A few LOCALS at the bar, where...

     Tanjo commands the scene, cheery, chatting with an IPTF
     OFFICER at the bar.

     Kathy stands, frozen , until she catches the eye of...

     Luba, sitting on the knee of a MIDDLE-AGED IPTF Officer.

77   INT./EXT. UN SUV - SHORT TIME LATER                            77

     Kathy SPEEDS up the mountain roads. Past many bars. One after
     another, after another... All filled with UN SUVs. Groups of
     drunk OFFICERS spill out. She stops across from one, seeing:

     Jan coming out of the bar. Kathy watches, stunned...

     Jan helps a drunk friend pile into an SUV. He looks up and
     sees Kathy as a car beam slides over her. She pulls away.

               They're thirteen, fourteen, fifteen--

                         JAN
               I know. If you let me finish, I got a
               call. Some friends needed a lift home
               because they got drunk. But hey lady, you
               better wake up! EVERYWHERE is a brothel.
               The coffee shop down the street. The post
               office. My corner store. That's how it is
               here. I'm not interested, and I try and
               stay in clean places. And if you don't
               believe me, then fuck you.

     He looks at her, hurt - He cares what she thinks. Kathy sees
     this. Something she hasn't felt in so long... Needed.

     She looks at him, fighting the urge to trust him. Jan brushes
     a strand of hair from her face. She lets go. He pulls her in.

     MESSAGE BOARD: Flashes of Various Posts: New Girl at the
     Berlin Bar; New Twelve Year-Old Pussy at the Old Grill.

     They scroll down dozens of posts. Kathy looks at Jan, shaken
     by the banal malevolence of a boys club gone wild.

81   INT. KATHY'S APARMENT - NIGHT                                  81

     Kathy watches Jan, asleep in her bed.

82   EXT. CENTRAL SARAJEVO - MORNING                                82

     Fog hangs low over the waking valley of Sarajevo.

83   INT. GDA - MORNING                                             83

     A DOCTOR signs off on a final examination of a now much
     healthier looking Raya. He smiles. She signs a form.

84   INT. LAURA'S OFFICE - GDA BOSNIA - DAY                         84

     Laura hovers in the background as Raya dials the phone. Her
     face raw with emotion.

                                                       INTERCUT WITH:

85   INT. RAYA'S APARTMENT - KYIV - SAME                            85

     The phone in the hall rings. But no one is there to answer.

86   INT. ROMAN AND ZENIA'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON                   86

     Halyna at the door. Zenia pales. O.S. A kettle whistles.

                         ZENIA (UKRAINIAN)
               Roman will be home soon.

                         HALYNA (UKRAINIAN)
               Make your tea. I'll be quick.

     KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

     Zenia pours tea out of a chrome kettle. Her hands shake.
     Halyna stares at a new dishwasher. Then a microwave, blender
     and small LCD TV. Suspiciously out of context in Kyiv.

                         HALYNA (UKRAINIAN) (CONT'D)
               Roman seems to be doing well.

                          ZENIA (UKRAINIAN)
               Milk?
                                                           TWB 42.


                         HALYNA
               I need to borrow money.

     Zenia looks up, unsure.

                         HALYNA (CONT'D)
               They found Raya in Sarajevo. I want to go
               and get her. I don't need much.

     Zenia nods, keeping still as possible.

                         HALYNA (CONT'D)
               Does he still hit you?

     Zenia chokes on her tea. Conflicted between love and guilt.
     She wants so badly to say... but she can't.

                         HALYNA (CONT'D)
               You know I hate to ask. But she's my
               daughter... and your niece. Please--

                         ZENIA
               I'll get you the money... But you have to
               go. Roman will be home soon. He won't
               give it to me if he knows it's for you.

87   INT. RICK JONES' OFFICE - MORNING                             87

     Kathy watches Rick flip through her report.

                          KATHY
               Fred Murray. There were other officers
               too. But the raid was not in the books.
               These girls were just sent back. They are
               clearly not waitresses. They are victims.
               I think IPTF were paid off to turn a
               blind eye.

                         RICK JONES
               That's a serious allegation. And you
               don't have any evidence. I can't open an
               investigation based on a hunch.

     He drops the papers.

                         RICK JONES (CONT'D)
               You're gonna need more than this.

88   INT. GDA BOSNIA - AFTERNOON                                   88

     Raya and Irka sit across from Laura Levin. She slides a
     document over to each of them.
                                                      TWB 43.


                    LAURA LEVIN (RUSSIAN)
          If you sign here, you confirm that you
          are voluntarily entering the repatriation
          program at the GDA.

Raya eyes Irka, confused. Laura softens slightly...

                    LAURA LEVIN (CONT'D)
          This means we can get you out of Bosnia.
          Isn't that what you want?

Raya's eyes widen. Irka is shocked, but joyous. They never
thought this moment would come...

                    LAURA LEVIN (CONT'D)
          You'll stay here for two weeks, to
          continue medical treatment as well as
          psychological counselling. We'll give you
          a ticket home and a stipend of $200 to
          get started when you return.

Suddenly Irka's face drops.

                    IRKA (RUSSIAN)
          But... What do I do then? My parents were
          killed in Kosovo. It was my brother who
          sold me here... Can't I go somewhere
          else?

Laura fumbles.

                    LAURA LEVIN
          We can only send you home, but what you
          choose to do after that is up to you.

But now, angry tears well in Raya's eyes. She looks up, torn.

                    RAYA (RUSSIAN)
          What about the others, the girls in the
          bar. My friend Luba, we ran, she
          couldn't... I don't know where she is...
          I can't go without her. Please...

Laura pauses, taken aback.

                    LAURA LEVIN
          I'm sorry, but my role here is to get you
          home. Otherwise you stay in Bosnia, where
          you... could face charges for illegal
          prostitution.

Raya stares, reeling... To be made to feel like a criminal?
                                                              TWB 44.


                         IRKA
               I will sign.

     Raya looks at her, but Irka doesn't look back.

89   INT. KATHY'S OFFICE - UNMHQ - SHORT TIME LATER                 89

     Kathy stares out across the central courtyard. Into the
     adjoining building. Through the glass, she watches...

     Fred Murray leading NEW RECRUITS through the halls. He jokes
     around, as the OFFICERS eye him with respect.

     The PHONE RINGS. Kathy turns.

90   INT. GDA - AFTERNOON                                           90

     Kathy stands in disbelief. Laura is stern.

                         KATHY
               Raya and Irka could be key witnesses in a
               UN investigation. I thought we were all
               on the same team.

                         LAURA LEVIN
               Irka can stay. But I can't keep Raya
               here. She is refusing to cooperate in the
               repatriation program.

                         KATHY
               Please, just let her stay two weeks. Then
               we can take it from there.

                         LAURA LEVIN
               We only house fourteen girls. It's a
               valuable spot.

                         KATHY
               Two weeks. If she's going to testify,
               she's not safe anywhere else.

     Laura shrugs, resigned.

91   INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - SHORT TIME LATER                         91

     Kathy sits across from Raya. A TRANSLATOR to the side,
     translates as Raya speaks.

                         RAYA (UKRAINIAN)
               We were supposed to work in a hotel.
               (shaking her head) Now... I can be
               charged with prostitution?
                                                      TWB 45.


                    KATHY
          There is another option... I want to help
          you find your friends. But you need to
          help me do that.

Kathy takes out the photo of Fred Murray and lays it on the
table. Raya eyes it, defiant, no reason to trust her.

                    KATHY (CONT'D)
          None of this is your fault. I want to go
          after the people who hurt you. But I need
          to know exactly what happens. As a
          witness in UN custody, you will be
          protected and will not be charged for any
          crimes.

Raya stares, still not convinced.

                    RAYA
          I...

The translator starts. Raya stops her. Frustrated. Turning to
Kathy...

                    RAYA (BROKEN ENGLISH) (CONT'D)
          UN will protect me? They don't protect me
          when they drink in bar and fuck me and my
          friends.

Kathy is humbled. She looks at Raya, open, raw...

                    KATHY
          I have a daughter, just your age... I
          wouldn't stop until I found her.

The two women stare at each other. A silent connection. Raya
looks down, almost... ashamed. Struggling to get this out...

                    RAYA
          I only left because... there was nothing,
          no jobs, no... chances. I was good in
          school. But with no money... My mother...
          She is on her own. She works so hard. But
          nothing changes. I thought I could help
          her. He said we would work in a hotel.
          With good wages...

Tears gathering in her eyes... It's terrifying to remember...

                    RAYA (CONT'D)
          But... When we got there... Other girls
          were there. Like us. From Ukraine,
          Moldova, Romania, everywhere... We were
          in the middle of nowhere.

                            RAYA (CONT'D)
                  Nobody could hear us... They... rape
                  us... One girl go crazy, screaming... He
                  shoots her. He shoots her right in the
                  head. Then we was... sold. Like animal.

     Raya is stopped by a rush of tears. Kathy reaches for her
     hand. Looking at this girl, so young...

     Raya looks Kathy squarely in the face. She slides the photo
     of Murray toward her.

                            KATHY
                  Do you know this man?

     Raya nods.

                            RAYA
                  He is not the only one. They come every
                  month. Tanjo give them money, so they
                  don't raid the bar. That day you come...
                  Tanjo did not want to pay. They want to
                  punish him. Take his money. His girls. I
                  ran...

     Raya sobs, knowing she has betrayed the system. Betting her
     life on the hope that this system won't betray her.

     MONTAGE:

     Kathy sits with GIRL after GIRL. Listening to their stories.
     Writing furiously...

     Kathy interviews EVA, 16. She talks through grateful tears.

     Kathy wasn't expecting that. Nadia throws down a photo.

               He loved the Firecracker.

     Nadia lifts up her sweatshirt, revealing a long scar.

     Kathy inspects the photo: Nadia with a SOUTH AMERICAN and
     U.S. IPTF: Their arms around her. One licks her face.

                         NADIA (CONT'D)
               They burn me. Then they laugh.

               Busy. I followed up on the Florida Bar.
               It's worse than I thought. There was a
               protection racket. IPTF... Americans,
               Romanians, were taking pay-offs to make
               sure the place wasn't busted. That raid
               was a punishment bust, because the owner
               stopped paying. But he must've settled it
               because the girls are right back where
               they started. Locked up in the hills.

     Rick scrambles for words, but Kathy's not finished.

                         KATHY (CONT'D)
               I talked to thirty five girls at the

               bars in large numbers. Rick, serious
               abuses are taking place. It's all in my
               reports.

                                                           TWB 49.


                         KATHY
               I've got two girls ready to testify about
               IPTF taking pay-offs--

                         RICK JONES
               Testify where?

                           KATHY
               In court.

                         RICK JONES
               A Bosnian court? Not gonna happen. All
               International Personnel have immunity.

     Kathy is stopped.

                         KATHY
               I know. But there must be some channel,
               some exception--

                         RICK JONES
               Look, you've done really good work here.
               These are serious allegations. Let me
               look into how to handle it. I'll get back
               to you.

95   EXT. OLD TOWN - SARAJEVO - EVENING                             95

     The markets shut down. The Catholic Church Bells ring. Across
     the square the Call to Prayer echoes from old loudspeakers`.

96   INT. KITCHEN - KATHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                       96

     Jan stirs a pan. Kathy awkwardly cuts vegetables beside him.

                         JAN
               It's different for us. We're all military
               or police. Every contingent except for
               the U.S... if someone does something
               wrong, they have to answer to a military
               tribunal at home. With the Americans...
               your Dyncorp guys? I don't think you have
               that.

                         KATHY
               So the Americans aren't legally
               accountable for anything?

                         JAN
               To be honest, I think our superiors would
               keep it quiet too. I mean, I haven't seen
               a military tribunal.
                                                           TWB 50.


     Jan can't help noticing that Kathy is making a mess of the
     vegetables. He takes the knife. She walks away, preoccupied.

                         JAN (CONT'D)
               You know my mission stay is up in a few
               weeks... You could come home with me.

                         KATHY
               To do what?

     She turns, glass of wine in hand, leaning on the counter.

                         JAN
               I was just... This place, y'know, it gets
               to you. I'm, I'm worried what will happen
               to you a year from now.

     She puts down her glass of wine, irritated.

                         KATHY
               You don't need to worry about me.

                         JAN
               Someone does.

     She looks at him, seeing... It's not discouragement. It's
     love.

                         KATHY
               So Fred Murray could just walk up to a
               man and shoot him in daylight and he'd
               never see the inside of a courtroom?

                         JAN
               In Bosnia, yes... but... I mean,
               something that public could get him sent
               home. And tried in his own country.

     Kathy gets an idea.

97   EXT. OLYMPIC STADIUM - SARAJEVO - DAY                          97

     A crumbling edifice, once home to the world's finest, now a
     reminder of humanity's worst. INSIDE...

     Kathy walks with Madeleine, who unleashes Helen the hound.

                         MADELEINE
               Helen loves it here. I think she has
               Olympic ambitions.

     Kathy hands Madeleine the files. She flips through.
                                                             TWB 51.


                         KATHY
               I wanted these girls to testify in a
               trial against the IPTF officers. But--

                         MADELEINE
               The immunity problem.

                         KATHY
               Okay, but if the girls testify in a
               Bosnian court against their trafficker...
               Tanjo... they'd have to mention what else
               goes on in the brothels.

     Madeleine nods. The dog comes bounding back.

                         MADELEINE
               It could work. If you make certain that
               in their testimony they mention every
               sordid detail of IPTF involvement--

                         KATHY
               That is their testimony. Then it would be
               on record. Somebody would have to pay
               attention. Like...the State Department?

     Madeleine grins, proud.

                         MADELEINE
               They're gonna answer for this.

98   INT. BASEMENT - UNMHQ - DAY                                   98

     Kathy weaves around the corner of a dimly lit, shabby
     hallway. She arrives at a doorway: VEHICLE DISPATCH.

99   INT. VEHICLE DISPATCH - UNMHQ - MOMENTS LATER                 99

     Kathy talks to LEWIS, 20s, American.

                         KATHY
               ...and the two girls have to go to the
               hospital to get immunized, or they can't
               stay in the country. I need an armored
               security vehicle.

     Lewis looks at her, almost laughing.

                         LEWIS
               You're lucky you have a car at all. We're
               stretched to the limit. Besides, isn't
               this a local police matter? Try them.
                                                            TWB 52.


100   EXT. LOCAL POLICE STATION - DAY                               100

      Kathy parks her SUV.

101   INT. LOCAL POLICE STATION - DAY                               101

      Kathy walks into the station, drawing the attention of the
      LOCAL COPS. Danik rolls his eyes.

                          KATHY
                I'm looking for--

      Danik turns away...

                          DANIK (BOSNIAK)
                Viko... your American girlfriend is here!

      Kathy eyes Danik. Viko comes out, smiling broadly at Kathy.

102   EXT. LOCAL POLICE STATION - MOMENTS LATER                     102

      Kathy and Viko walk out, energized with a sense of purpose.

                          VIKO
                It's no problem. The Van is just sitting
                here. Let's go.

      They arrive at a POLICE VAN. Kathy eyes it.

                          VIKO (CONT'D)
                It's not exactly armored, but it will do
                the trick. You follow me, yes?

      He jumps in, and starts it up. Kathy follows in her UN SUV.

      Across the street, a LOCAL MAN watches from INSIDE A CAR.

103   EXT. GDA BOSNIA - EVENING                                     103

      Kathy SWERVES up. Viko has the Van parked right up against
      the door. Kathy jumps out.

104   INT. FOYER - GDA BOSNIA - MOMENTS LATER                       104

      Laura leads a very scared Raya out. Kathy smiles, gentle.

                          KATHY
                (at Laura) Where's Irka?

      Laura takes a deep breath, eyeing Raya...

                          LAURA LEVIN
                I need to have a word with you.
                                                      TWB 53.


Kathy looks at her watch -- at Raya. Viko taps her shoulder.

                    VIKO
          I'll take her. Meet us when you're done.

As Viko and Raya leave, Kathy stops her...

                    KATHY
          I'll be right behind you. Are you okay?

Raya nods, trusting in Kathy. Who turns, angry, back to...

                    LAURA LEVIN
          I was going to call you. There was a
          problem. During our repatriation
          procedures, we realized Irka had no
          passport.

                    KATHY
          So we get her one. Where is she?

                    LAURA LEVIN
          You don't get it. She was trafficked from
          Belgrade. Her parents were killed in
          Kosovo. And she has no documentation. No
          embassy will recognize her. She is a girl
          without a country.

                    KATHY
          She is a witness for a UN investigation!

GDA EMPLOYEES peer. An INTERN betrays a twinge of complicity.

                    LAURA LEVIN
          We handed her over to the police a few
          hours ago. I couldn't keep her. I've
          already done every favour I could for
          you. This is not on me.

                    KATHY
          You had no right to do that!

                    LAURA LEVIN
          I had every right. We have a system that
          works here. You're the one disrupting it.

Kathy stares at her. Fuming.

                    KATHY
          Where did they take her?

Laura shrugs. Shaking off guilt has become a necessary habit.

Just then the door opens. And...
                                                               TWB 54.


      HALYNA

      Walks in. Disoriented, emotion rising...

                          HALYNA (BROKEN ENGLISH)
                I... look for Laura Levin?

                             LAURA LEVIN (RUSSIAN)
                That's me.

      Kathy holds her anger, smiling respectfully at Halyna. Laura
      leads her away. Kathy searches for an answer, her eyes
      landing on... The Intern. Unrelenting...

                          KATHY
                If you know anything, this is on you.

                          INTERN
                I think the cops leave them somewhere
                near the border, so that with no papers,
                the girls have to cross the border
                illegally. Take the 103 to Visegrad.

105   INT./EXT. UN SUV - NIGHT                                      105

      Kathy. Speeding down the 103. A two-lane winding road.
      Seeing... Nothing but the 20 feet her headlights show.

      Kathy's eyes GLUED on the road, trying to make out a SIGN...

      LANDMINES. Then another sign... VISEGRAD PRAVO.

      Sharp Turn. Onto a GRAVEL ROAD. She brakes. SKIDDING.

109   INT. POLICE VAN / EXT. SARAJEVO - SAME                        109

      Viko stops at a traffic light. Raya peers out a crack in the
      van. Seeing... Young WOMEN in the streets. Laughing.

      Kathy slows her car... FLICKERING LIGHTS. She approaches...

      A BORDER STATION: A GRAVEL ROAD leads up to it. Kathy slows.

      BORDER GUARDS smoke and play cards. One guard saunters over.

                          KATHY
                I'm looking for a girl. She was dropped
                here a few hours ago.

      He shrugs, shaking his head.

                          KATHY (CONT'D)
                Can you check the border logs? She's
                about 15, the police brought her here but
                she didn't have a passport. Maybe--

                          GUARD
                Lady. I know what you're looking for.
                Those girls do not go through the border.
                They go through there...

      He points... A THICK Forest. Stretching for MILES.

                To Serbia.

      Kathy stares at the endless forest. A dirt road cuts through
      the middle. She jumps in her SUV, and HURTLES down the road.

111   INT./EXT. POLICE VAN/SARAJEVO - SAME                          111

      Viko turns down a narrow street. He glances in his rear view
      mirror. An old TRABBANT follows him. He veers down an alley.

      Kathy's SUV crawls alongside the FOREST. HIGHBEAMS off the
      top of the car. SCANNING all around. Then, in a clearing up
      ahead...

      A SILHOUETTE. Kathy ACCELERATES.

113   INT./EXT. POLICE VAN ALLEY/SARAJEVO - SAME                    113

      She turns. It's Irka. Kathy cranks the wheel, driving off the
      road and onto...

      A WIDE FIELD

      The SUV is jolted by the uneven terrain. Irka peers into the
      blinding light. Then runs...

115   INT./EXT. POLICE VAN/SARAJEVO - SAME                          115

      Viko drives up the deserted street. SUDDENLY two BATTERED
      MERCEDES fly out from SIDE ROADS and block the way.

      Viko BRAKES hard. Raya is thrown to the side of the Van.

116   EXT. FOREST - NIGHT                                           116

      Two MEN jump out of the cars. With RIFLES. Viko SPEEDS
      forward. But..

      GUNFIRE. Raya SCREAMS. A TIRE BLOWN OUT.

      The Van SKIDS to a HALT. Viko SMASHES against the window.

      Raya tries the doors, but they won't open. She wails,
      SLAMMING herself against the door. Desperate.

      Kathy raises her arms, waving...

      Irka turns. Kathy can see her clearly now, disoriented beyond
      bearing. Irka shields her face from the distant headlights.
                                                               TWB 57.


      Kathy steps out of their glare. And then...Irka recognizes
      her. She collapses, releasing confused tears. Kathy walks
      over, careful, slowly bending to help.

                          IRKA
                Please... let me die.

      Kathy holds her. As the young girl cries.

121   INT./EXT. POLICE VAN/SARAJEVO - SAME                          121

      The Men approach the Van. Raya's BANGING ECHOES from inside,
      reverberating around the empty street. Nobody can hear her...

122   EXT. BOSNIAN COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT                              122

      Isolated stars peek through clouds, drifting over dark hills
      stretching far into the horizon....

123   INT. KATHY'S OFFICE - UNMHQ - NIGHT                           123

      Kathy and Viko sit silent. Barry hangs up the phone.

                          BARRY
                Okay. We've got a safe house in the
                mountains. Nobody knows she's here, so
                we're clear to take her there now.

      Kathy looks across the room to Irka, who sits hunched,
      looking out the window. Totally alone.

124   EXT. FARM HOUSE - MOUNTAINS - NIGHT                           124

      A MIDDLE AGED COUPLE lead Irka inside a small home. In the
      MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. Shrouded in the black night. Nobody will
      find her here. In the doorway, Irka turns to Kathy and Viko.

                          IRKA (BROKEN ENGLISH)
                Where is Raya?

      They stare back at her. The woman closes the door. Kathy and
      Viko stand in the dead silence. His face bruised.

                          KATHY
                Let's go back to the Florida Bar--

                          VIKO
                You think he'd be that stupid?

                          KATHY
                I don't care! I have nothing else to go
                on, do I?

      Adrenalin overtaking sadness. Viko follows Kathy to the car.
                                                               TWB 58.

      Kathy and Viko pull up. It's in full swing.

126   INT. FLORIDA BAR - NIGHT                                      126

      They step inside, and IN ONE GLANCE, see... THE WHOLE SET OF
      GIRLS is different. No Luba, No Raya, No Tanjo... The IPTF
      barely notice her.

127   EXT. FLORIDA BAR - NIGHT                                      127

      Kathy steps out. Furious.

                          VIKO
                They moved them already.

                          KATHY
                Fuck!

      At the end of her rope.

128   INT. GDA - NIGHT                                              128

      Laura, at a total loss, eyes... Halyna. Sitting. Terrified.

                          HALYNA (RUSSIAN)
                ...How could? No, no, no... my, Raya....
                What!? What will they do to her?

129   EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT                                    129

      A BROWN VAN snakes through the distant mountain roads.

130   INT. BROWN VAN - SAME                                         130

      IVAN, 40s, drives. Tanjo is in the passenger seat.

                          TANJO (SERBIAN)
                We'll stop soon. We're far enough now.

      Ivan nods. Tanjo cranes into the back of the van. He turns on
      an overhead light, revealing...

      Five girls. Huddled in the back.

                          TANJO (RUSSIAN) (CONT'D)
                So you want to testify?

      All the girls turn to... Raya. Their conscience paralyzed by
      the need to survive. Terrified, Raya looks to... Luba. Her
      eyes pleading for support. But Luba turns away.
                                                            TWB 59.


                          TANJO (CONT'D)
                It's okay. We all move to a new bar now.
                Somewhere no one will come look for you.
                Then we have a conversation.

      The girls avoid Raya's gaze. She sobs. Tanjo turns off the
      light. The van drives off into the unknown.

131   EXT. PARKING LOT - BACK ENTRANCE - UNMHQ - MORNING            131

      Kathy stands by her SUV, watching MONITORS set off for the
      day. Then she sees...

      Fred Murray emerge with COLLEAGUES, laughing. He stops when

      He sees Kathy, gazing over, serious.

132   EXT. PARKING LOT - UNMHQ- DAY                                 132

      Kathy and Fred walk between the parked cars.

                          KATHY
                She's fifteen. I'm begging you--

                          FRED MURRAY
                I don't know what you're talking about.

                          KATHY
                If you know any of the other bars he
                owns, anything... I'm appealing to--

                          FRED MURRAY
                Hey. I'm gonna say this one more time.
                And you can put this down in your
                investigation on me. I don't know what
                you're talking about.

      He leaves. Kathy stands, a black speck in the patchwork of
      white UN SUVs spread across the lot.

133   INT. RICK JONES OFFICE - UNMHQ - DAY                          133

      Rick's SECRETARY shakes her head at Kathy.

                          SECRETARY
                I've called and paged. He says he can't
                get into this now.

                          KATHY
                Does he know that one of my witnesses was
                abducted? Where is he?

                          SECRETARY
                Sorry Kathy, he really didn't tell me.

                          MADELEINE
                It's not your fault.

      Kathy is downcast. She nods, not totally convinced.

                           KATHY
                Irka won't testify now. It's completely
                understandable. She's way too scared. I
                just... I don't know what to do with her.
                The GDA won't take her and her
                traffickers will find her if she's in
                this city.

      Emotion taking over...

                          KATHY (CONT'D)
                These girls are dragged into this country
                like cattle and then the system that's
                supposed to help them spits them right
                back out. It barely recognizes sex
                trafficking as a problem even though it's
                a fucking epidemic, and everyone knows
                it. Are we supposed to wait around for
                that to change?

                          MADELEINE
                Maybe it's time for a little diplomacy...
                Do you have a nice frock?

135   INT. KATHY'S APARMENT - NIGHT                                135

      Kathy stands in front of a mirror, in a black dress, her hair
      hanging down to her shoulders. She stands, awkward.

                          KATHY
                Really? You think it's okay?

      She turns to Jan and Carmen, sitting on her bed. Jan smiles.

                          JAN
                You're beautiful.

      But Carmen is tilting her head, doubtful.

                          CARMEN
                You can stop standing like a farmer's
                wife for starters. These people are
                dignitaries. You gotta up your game.

      She approaches her, and sweeps her hair up into an elegant
      chignon. She takes off her own earrings and puts them on
      Kathy. Jan nods, impressed. Kathy eyes herself, pleased.
                                                               TWB 61.


136   INT./EXT. CAR/SARAJEVO HILLS - EVENING                        136

      A WHITE VOLKSWAGON RABBIT speeds though the Sarajevo hills.
      Madeleine is elegant in a suit. Kathy looks at her black
      dress, self-conscious.

                             KATHY
                   Is there a specific way of addressing the
                   High Commissioner of the Mission?

                             MADELEINE
                   I call him Bill.

      Kathy nods, nervous. They pull into a circular drive...

137   EXT. U.S. AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - SHORT TIME LATER           137

      The house is incongruous in its context: Manicured gardens,
      remodelled facade. And tonight its BLACK TIE and CATERING.

      An elegant WOMAN comes to greet them. She is...

                             MADELEINE
                   (familiar) Mrs. Ambassador! How do we do?

                              JANET WELLS
                   We do what we can. Great to see you
                   Madeleine.

      Janet smiles with the delicatesse of a diplomatic spouse.

                             MADELEINE
                   I hope you don't mind, I've brought along
                   a friend. This is Kathy Bolkovac.

      Kathy holds out her hand, a little nervous.

                             JANET WELLS
                   Great. I need as many gal pals as I can
                   get. Look at this place.

      She gestures toward the room. A haze of cigar smoke hovers
      over the gaggle of men. Kathy's eyes zero in on

      Bill Hynes

      Surrounded by a group of JAPANESE DIPLOMATS. Bill notices her
      and Madeleine. He waves, familiar. Madeleine nods, humoring.

      AMBASSADOR JOHN WELLS, 40s, slides his hand on Janet's back.

                             AMBASSADOR WELLS
                   What are your thoughts on dinner?

                          JANET WELLS
                I think people are still busy drinking.

      John shakes Madeleine's hand, darting his eyes over Kathy.

                          AMBASSADOR WELLS
                Speaking of, what can I get you ladies?

      Madeleine looks at Kathy.

                          KATHY
                Thank you, Mr. Ambassador. Ah, I'll have
                a wine please.

                          AMBASSADOR WELLS
                (nodding) Coming right up. Madeleine,
                white for you?

      Kathy notices the respect he shows her. Janet leads them in,
      chatting with Madeleine. Kathy surveys the room full of
      dignitaries.

138   EXT. BACK PATIO - U.S. AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - NIGHT         138

      A stunning view of Sarajevo at night. Kathy stands alone. A
      waiter offers her a convoluted hors d'oeuvre. She takes it,
      gracious. Trying to figure out what it is when...

                          MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                Nice view, no?

      Kathy turns to... PETER WARD, 40s, smoking a cigarette.

                          KATHY
                Oh I... I just needed some air.

                          PETER WARD
                Trust me, I know the feeling. I hate
                these stuffy events. You never know
                anyone's agenda.

      He eyes her. She looks past him... At Bill Hynes. Peter sees.

                          PETER WARD (CONT'D)
                Oh... well that's a plan.

                          MADELEINE (O.S.)
                Actually, I had a different one in mind.

      Madeleine and Janet come through the door. Peter stubs out
      his cigarette, and moves back inside.
                                                            TWB 63.

                man...

      PATIO - SHORT TIME LATER

      Janet's eyes betray empathy. She shakes her head, upset.

                          JANET WELLS
                They just left her there? At the border?
                Poor girl... Just the psychological
                trauma. How can I help?

                          KATHY
                She's very vulnerable to re-trafficking.
                Internationals got her in this situation.
                We owe her the chance to get out.

      Janet is keen to follow, but a little lost.

                          MADELEINE
                We want to repatriate Irka to the United
                States and find her a foster family. I
                was hoping you could use your influence--

      Janet holds up her hand, nodding emphatically.

                          JANET WELLS
                We're going to find her a home.

      Kathy eyes Madeleine. Impressed.

                          KATHY
                I also think the American embassy should
                be aware of some of the problems we're
                having with our officers.

      Madeleine interjects...

                          MADELEINE
                Your help with Irka's case can really
                raise awareness in the Mission around the
                issue of trafficking.

      Madeleine gives her a reassuring glance. Kathy sees the
      difference between a cop and a diplomat.

139   INT. KATHY'S OFFICE - UNMHQ - NIGHT                        139

      Kathy stands. Still in her dress, going through files. Proud
      of the night's accomplishments, but her eyes linger on the
      board of girls... On the picture of Raya's APB.

      Sun over the hills. A DOG follows a YOUNG BOY, 5, through a
      field. The boy stops, seeing a BROWN VAN down the road.

      He runs, waving as the van approaches. It slows to meet him.
      In the van... Ivan rolls down the window.

                           BOY (SERBIAN)
                 Can I come with you?

                              IVAN (SERBIAN)
                 Not today.

      The boy looks down, disappointed.

                           IVAN (CONT'D)
                 Tell your mother I'll be home for dinner.
                 Then you and I will go for a walk. I have
                 a present for you.

                           BOY
                 What is it?

      Ivan shrugs jokingly. Then smiles as he drives away.

141   EXT. BOMBED OUT BUILDING - BOSNIAN COUNTRY HOUSE - MORNING    141

      The brown van pulls up. Ivan comes around it, and opens the
      back door. He reaches in and pulls out... AN OLD BICYCLE.

                            TANJO (SERBIAN)
                 You couldn't buy him a new one? You have
                 money now.

                           IVAN (SERBIAN)
                 I'll fix this one up this afternoon. I
                 had one like it.

      Tanjo lights a cigarette, moving to the destroyed building.

                            TANJO
                 They're downstairs. I want to get them
                 out today.

142   INT. STAIRWELL - BOMBED OUT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER          142

      Ivan follows Tanjo down rickety steps. CRIES AND WHIMPERS
      GROW LOUDER as they descend into a

      BASEMENT

      TWO MEN stand guard. Tanjo walks past them. Opens a door.
      Ushering Ivan INSIDE where...

      GIRLS are huddled together. Luba, and THREE OTHERS. They look
      up... PETRIFIED... Offscreen, the cries swell.

      We realize the sound IS NOT COMING FROM THIS ROOM. Tanjo
      waves his fingers, methodically...

                          TANJO (RUSSIAN)
                C'mon, let's go.

      The girls stand, helping one another. Tentative but
      submissive, they move toward him. He holds open the door.

                          TANJO (CONT'D)
                I want to show you what happens when YOU
                DECIDE TO TALK TO COPS!!!!

      They jump back. His scream echoes. They move

      THROUGH THE HALL

      To a door on the other side. Tanjo nods. A guard opens the
      door onto A HORRIFIC SITE... Luba closes her eyes. But Tanjo
      pushes the girls in, one by one they go through into a

      BARREN ROOM

      And see... Raya... NAKED. HELD DOWN BY FOUR MEN. SPREAD EAGLE
      ON HER FRONT. WAILING. HER FACE SHOWS UNIMAGINABLE PAIN. And
      we see that...

      Two of the men holding her down are EXTINGUISHING LIT
      CIGARETTES INTO THE BALLS OF HER FOOT.

                          RAYA
                Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!

      But we realize... this is not the greatest cause of her pain.

      Luba's face whitens. Eyeing one MAN at Raya's backside. A
      flash of shame in his eyes as he steps away from Raya, and
      drops... A PIPE onto the ground.

      The men step away. Leaving Raya. Collapsed into a ball. Now
      the girls all understand... there is no hope at all.

                          MADELEINE
                The young woman, who shall remain
                anonymous, arrived in Bosnia as a victim
                of sex trafficking and has survived
                horrific abuse.

                          MADELEINE (CONT'D)
                Ordinarily she would be repatriated to
                her country of origin. But because she is
                an orphan, she finds herself without a
                home. I'm pleased to announce that we
                have found a foster family in the United
                States. I want to thank Janet Wells for
                her assistance in making this happen. I
                believe this can stand as a signal that
                the International community in Bosnia and
                beyond is finally ready to recognize the
                growing epidemic of sex trafficking, a
                human rights abuse as abhorrent as the
                war crimes that drew the International
                Community to intervene in Bosnia in the
                first place. Thank you.

                          REPORTER
                Now that the UN is finally recognizing
                sex-trafficking, how are you going to
                monitor it?

      Reporters flock with questions. Kathy stands in the back,
      proud. On the other side, Rick Jones watches.

                Kath, you gotta be careful. Look, I know

                you're investigating your colleagues.

      Carmen eyes Kathy, concerned. Kathy follows the monitor
      toward the exit. MONITORS and CIVILIANS buzz about, talking.
      But all around Kathy, the air is silent. Some IPTF OFFICERS
      eye her, coolly. Is she paranoid?

Ivan and Mara leave, locking the door behind him.

          You sleep on whichever mattresses are
          available. The last two girls in have to

          They bring us food in the morning. You

Raya grabs her head. Feeling faint. She looks for a place to
sit. Julia and Tanya help her to the ground.

          Don't let him see you like this.

Luba walks over to the other side of the room. Finds a spot
and sits. Raya watches her, hurt. Julia pushes a mattress
aside. Underneath is a... COUNTING SYSTEM scratched into the
floor. Each girls' name scratched with numbers beside it.

Raya eyes Luba who's conflicted between loyalty to her friend

      She works fast. Circling the photos, slapping files closed.
      When a...

      MAIL BOY slides in a cart, and places a stack of REPORTS on
      Kathy's IN-BOX. She pulls the first one off the top...

      A sticky note on the first page: Insufficient Evidence.

      Kathy grabs another... Sticky note: Unreliable Witness. She
      sees the name NADIA at the top of the statement.

      She grabs... ANOTHER: Unreliable Witness. And another...

      Transferred to Internal Affairs.

      Kathy flies through the rest of the files. One after another:

      Insufficient Evidence -- Insufficient Evidence -- Transferred
      to Internal Affairs --Unreliable Witnesses -- Insufficient --

      A photo falls out of one of them: RAYA. Kathy stares at it.

      Her eyes wander over the room, and fall on her predecessor's
      battered old file boxes, still waiting for Archives.

      She moves to them. Cuts the string on the top box. Rips the
      top off. Inside...

      REPORT FILES. Slotted in tight. She grabs one. STICKY NOTE:

      Insufficient Evidence.

                          KATHY
                Jesus.

      She starts RIPPING through them all -- YELLOW STICKY NOTES on
      all of them.

      Kathy and Jim walk into a room filled with DYNCORP BOYS.

                          JIM HIGGINS
                Anyone know what this is about?

      No one does. Kathy sits amongst the guys. Until...

      Rick walks up to the front.

                          RICK
                I have some not so pleasant news, but
                bear with me. (Off a prepared statement)
                Lately, local police have raided some
                houses of `ill repute' and a number of
                `ladies of the evening' have been taken
                into custody. While the credibility of
                these witnesses is questionable,
                apparently photo line-ups have been made
                available to them.

      Rick eyes Kathy, pointedly.

                          RICK (CONT'D)
                This issue is currently receiving a lot
                of attention. Guys, you gotta be
                careful... Kathryn Bolkovac is heading up
                this investigation. If you have any
                questions refer them to her.

      ALL EYES ON KATHY. They disperse, passing her, camaraderie
      obliterated. Kathy walks, livid...

                          KATHY
                You've given every officer time to create
                an alibi.

                          RICK
                I'm not going to subject my men to this
                witch hunt based on the testimony of some
                hookers! Prostitution is illegal! Your
                witnesses are criminals.

      Kathy can't believe what he's saying.

                          KATHY
                They are SLAVES. By any American or
                International law.

                          RICK
                These slaves are lying about their
                presence in Bosnia. You are coming after
                American Officers with baseless claims.

                          KATHY
                ...you know they're not baseless.

156   INT./EXT. LOBBY - UNMHQ - EVENING                           156

      ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN. Kathy comes out. Seeing... IPTF
      OFFICERS. All eyeing her. She hurries through them.

157   INT. KATHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                              157

      Kathy sits, anxious. Jan touches her back.

                          JAN
                They hired you to do a job they don't
                want done. It's a P.R. position.

      She turns to him.

                          KATHY
                Rick publicly outed me, jeopardizing
                those girls. I have to go over his head.
                But I... I never thought I'd have to go
                into Internal Affairs. The guys back home
                would never understand this.

                          JAN
                I understand you.

                          KATHY
                Yeah? And how long do you plan on being
                around, because the last two guys who
                said that aren't here.

                            JAN
                Don't.

                          KATHY
                It's just I waited so long you know. I
                want my kids to know I did something, to
                be proud.

                            JAN
                They are.

                          KATHY
                No. Your kids are proud. You go on this
                mission and you're a big hero. I go and
                I'm a bad mother... (tearing up) I can't
                believe I'm gonna disappoint them again.

                            JAN
                So don't.

      He comes closer. She looks up. Decided.

158   INT./EXT. CAR - PARKING LOT - UNMHQ - EARLY MORNING        158

      A blast of light through Kathy's windshield. The lot is
      empty. She looks at a PILE OF REPORTS on the passenger seat.

159   INT. LONG CORRIDOR - UNMHQ - MORNING                       159

      Kathy, reports in hand, turns a corner, and... bumps into an
      OFFICER. She drops some files. He moves around her, as she
      bends to pick them up. She walks the rest of the hall,
      focused, and stops at a brass plaque: INTERNAL AFFAIRS.

160   INT. OFFICE - INTERNAL AFFAIRS - UNHMQ - MORNING           160

      Kathy marches in, nervous... MONITORS turn and see her,
      knowing who she is, but trying not to show it. She approaches
      a MALE MONITOR at a desk in the front.

                          MALE MONITOR
                What can I do for you?

      The Monitor keeps typing as she talks. Kathy hesitates, then

                          KATHY
                It's, I need to speak in-camera with a
                senior IA official. I don't have a name,
                but--

      Kathy recognizes Peter Ward working in a back OFFICE. He sees
      her, then closes the door.

                          MALE MONITOR
                Just a moment please.

161   INT. CLOSED OFFICE - INTERNAL AFFAIRS - UNMHQ - DAY        161

      Kathy sits across from an IA OFFICIAL, 50s. He skims through
      the reports, nodding.
                                                            TWB 76.


                          KATHY
                I did a photo ID line-up with victims who
                testified to international patronizing of
                brothels, as well as complicity in
                trafficking itself.

      He looks at her.

                          KATHY (CONT'D)
                All the cases I filed to my superiors
                have come back, shut down. Some of them
                were marked as referred to IA.

                          OFFICIAL
                I haven't seen those.

                             KATHY
                Really?

      He shakes his head, standing.

                          OFFICIAL
                It's possible they're still in the
                pipeline, in preliminary processing. I'm
                sorry to have to rush this, but I have to
                get to a meeting. Thanks for coming in.

      He hands her a form.

                          OFFICIAL (CONT'D)
                You need to sign here, that you're asking

      Kathy jogs along a ridge, with a view high over Sarajevo.
      Determined, panting... she pushes past her fatigue.

163   INT. KATHY'S APARMENT - SHORT TIME LATER                    163

      Kathy comes in, soaked in sweat. The PHONE RINGS. She rushes
      to it. CALLER ID: Unknown Number. She picks up, breathless.

                          KATHY
                Hello?... Sorry, who is this?... Just one
                second...

      She grabs a pen and pad. Writing: THE HOLIDAY INN. 513.

                          KATHY (CONT'D)
                Can I get your name? Hello? Hello?

      She looks at the phone, spooked.

164   INT. LOBBY - HOLIDAY INN HOTEL - SARAJEVO - DAY               164

      Kathy moves through the lobby, scanning the scene of liquid
      lunches and diplomats. She keeps her head low, focused

      ON THE ELEVATORS

      Ding. The doors open. Kathy steps in. As they close... TWO
      DIPLOMATS slip in. The elevator ascends. Kathy stares dead
      ahead.

165   INT. HALLWAY - HOLIDAY INN - MOMENTS LATER                    165

      Kathy stands at door 513. She takes a moment, then knocks.

166   INT. HOTEL ROOM - HOLIDAY INN - MOMENTS LATER                 166

      Kathy is led in by Peter Ward. She comes inside, tentative,
      unsure who she's dealing with. Peter smokes furiously, a
      burned-out mission lifer, who's bright, intelligent eyes
      betray a last spark of the idealism that brought him into
      this world. He seems nervous.

                          KATHY
                That was you today, in IA?

                          PETER WARD
                (nodding) Would you like a drink?

      Kathy eyes him, dubious. He pours her a drink.

                          PETER WARD (CONT'D)
                I saw your files...

      Kathy nods. Peter slaps down a file. Kathy looks at it.

                          KATHY
                What's this?

                             PETER WARD
                Your file.

                          KATHY
                I don't understand.

                          PETER WARD
                They're investigating you.

      Kathy stares at him.

                          PETER WARD (CONT'D)
                Don't you get it? They're circling the
                wagons... What did he tell you? He hadn't
                seen anything from you until today.

She nods.

                      PETER WARD (CONT'D)
            Bullshit. Top Level Dyncorp commanders
            are walking into IA and removing your
            files. I've been told to shut down all
            your investigations.

                      KATHY
            Why?.. There has to be some sort of an
            international court or body that can turn
            this around--

                      PETER WARD
            The United Nations. You're here.

Peter thinking about how to put this...

                      PETER WARD (CONT'D)
            Dyncorp's contract with the State
            Department in Bosnia alone is worth 52
            million dollars. We're paid ninety, a
            hundred grand, right?. But it's a drop in
            the ocean compared to their profits. This
            is a global corporation, top five defense
            contractors in the states after
            Halliburton and KB&R. You think they're
            gonna let some sex scandal threaten that?

                      KATHY
            I don't want a scandal. I just want--

                      PETER WARD
            NOBODY CARES ABOUT YOU. It's designed
            that way. No oversight. No national or
            international accountability.

                      KATHY
            Dyncorp's Headquarters are in England--

                      PETER WARD
            Exactly. Nothing leads back to the State
            Department. That includes you... So if
            something were to happen to you it
            wouldn't even make the news at home... No
            one would ever know... Poof. You're gone.

Kathy sits. Scared. Finally understanding the world she's in.

O.S. VOICES. Kathy jolts. Peter moves to the door.

THROUGH THE EYE-HOLE: A COUPLE checks in across the room.

Peter turns back. Sees a panic-stricken Kathy.

                If you're going to keep going, you've got
                to stay under the radar. Make copies of
                all your files, keep them under lock and
                key. Just... Be careful... And know who
                you're up against.

167   EXT. PARKING LOT - HOLIDAY INN HOTEL - SARAJEVO - DAY         167

      Kathy. Unstrung. She crosses the labyrinth of WHITE SUVs. She
      looks up at the OSCE towers. Feeling watched.

      TWO SFOR SOLDIERS walk toward her. Eyeing her. She slips a
      car key between her fingers, arming herself. Watching them
      as... They pass. Kathy picks up her pace. Getting to...

      HER SUV. Her pulse RACING. PARANOID. She checks around...
      The lot is empty. Quiet. She is alone.

168   EXT. UNITED NATIONS MISSION HEADQUARTERS - DAY                168

      A row of international flags flap in the wind.

169   INT. KATHY'S OFFICE - UNMHQ - SAME                            169

      Kathy watches the flags. She shifts her gaze to the bulletin
      board. Eyeing the picture of Raya. Then... she moves to...

      THE FILE CABINET. She pulls out   EVERY FILE. Photocopies them.
      Then... Opens the bottom filing   cabinet -- pushes files to
      the front -- placing the copies   in the back. She steps
      away... Closes the Cabinet. And   locks it...

      Knowing she is operating outside of protocol now.

170   INT. BACK BEDROOM - OASIS BAR - EVENING                       170

      Raya stares at herself in a mirror. Dressed as a whore.

171   INT. OASIS BAR - EVENING                                      171

      It's more of a medium-sized hall. A bar, some tables and a
      few `home touches'. Maps of Yugoslavia. Pictures of Tito.

      And FULL OF IPTF. Raya walks through, ogled. She sees...

      Luba, sitting on Mara's lap. Surrounded by TEN IRISH
      SOLDIERS. The soldiers ply them with drinks, `winning' them
      with charm. Luba blends in with remarkable ease.

                          RORY
                You feel like a party?

      RORY, Irish, grabs Raya's hand.

                          RAYA
                (forcing) Yes... of course.

      He leads her to the back of the bar. Raya looks to Luba, but
      realizes she is alone.

      They walk through a BACK DOOR into a ROOM FULL OF BEDS
      SEPARATED with CURTAINS. We barely make out the shapes of
      various soldiers with girls in each cubicle. All busy. Until

      A curtain opens... And Jim Higgins walks out. His rite of
      passage complete.

      Rory pulls Raya to the cubicle, as Julia comes out.

172   EXT. SARAJEVO AIRPORT - EVENING                              172

      Halyna boards a plane with PASSENGERS, but without Raya.

      Kathy opens the door into the empty apartment, seeing a
      RAPIDLY BLINKING LIGHT on a digital display: 14 MESSAGES.

                          ANSWERING MACHINE
                Click. Click. Click.

      Each message a silence followed by a hang-up. Kathy stares at
      the blinking light as the clicks keep coming. CLICK, CLICK,
      CLICK... She rips the machine out of the wall.

174   INT. KATHY'S APARTMENT - LATER                               174

      We hear a DIAL UP CONNECTION. Kathy's at her computer. She
      brings up a Yahoo! Search page. TYPES IN: RICK JONES

      2103 Matches for Rick Jones.

      She types again. CLOSE ON: RICK JONES + COLORADO SPRINGS

      482 Matches for Rick Jones + Colorado Springs

      She scans down the page. None of the matches work. She shakes
      her head, about to give up, when...

      Chief of Police R. Jones in $1,000,000 Law Suit

      A PICTURE of Rick Jones accompanies the article.

      Kathy sits at the empty kitchen table looking at the picture

176   EXT. AMERICAN APARTMENT COMPLEX - SARAJEVO SUBURBS - NIGHT    176

      Distant music echoes through the night. VOICES of GUYS
      hanging out on their balconies. Kathy crosses the lot,
      cutting through the dark night fog.

177   INT./EXT. SUV/ROAD - NIGHT                                    177

      Jan and Kathy sit. Several empty coffee cups.

                          KATHY
                This is... I can't believe your timing...

                          JAN
                It's a rotation. They're sending us back
                a month early. I tried to get an
                extension, but...

      Kathy just stares ahead. Silent... a long time.

                          KATHY
                I'm not even sure I'm staying.

      Jan sits back. Stunned.

                          KATHY (CONT'D)
                These guys... Jones is a sexual offender.
                Dyncorp hired him... These private
                militaries are a sham. There's no way
                around them.

                          JAN

180   INT. OASIS BAR - LATE NIGHT                                  180

      A big IPTF PARTY. AT THE BAR: Raya waits with an empty tray.
      Luba pulls out a heavy crate of bottles. She hurts her back.

                          RAYA (UKRAINIAN)
                Here, I'll help you.

      Luba slams two bottles on Raya's tray.

                          LUBA (UKRAINIAN)
                I'm fine. I earned this job.

                          RAYA
                I was just trying to--

                          LUBA
                Don't. You'll get us in trouble.

      An IPTF OFFICER, MIKE SEARS grabs Raya from behind. Shakes
      her, jokingly. She laughs, familiar. Almost routine..

                          MIKE SEARS
                How's my favorite girl?

                          RAYA
                I am good. Everything good.

      She smiles, hollow and takes the tray over to a TABLE. Julia
      and Tanya sit with FOUR MEN in suits. They're plastered.

                          SUIT 1 (GERMAN ACCENT)
                I wanna party all night.

                Let's go out. I wanna take you home.

      He squeezes Tanya tight to him, kissing her sloppily.

                Ivan! C'mere!

      Raya eyes Julia. Ivan comes over, smiling, a gregarious host.

                          SUIT 2 (CONT'D)
                We wanna party on mate. How much to take
                them home for the day?

      Ivan eyes the girls. Thinking...

                Ten times normal. Pay upfront. And extra
                deposit. But you cannot take her.

      He points at Raya.

                          IVAN (CONT'D)
                Three thousand each. (off their scoffing)
                You bring back, you get back deposit.

      Ivan smiles. The other two men are dubious. But Suit 1 and
      Suit 2 exchange glances... Daring each other.

                             SUIT 1
                You're on.

      Ivan waves to follow him. They walk with Julia and Tanya.
      Raya watches Ivan throw in a bottle of whiskey. They pay him.

      Julia catches Raya's eye. They exchange... A look of promise.

181   EXT. BUS DEPOT - MORNING                                     181

      The DUTCH CONTINGENT boards a bus. Kathy stands aside with
      Jan. Saying goodbye... Franz pats Jan on the back.

                          FRANZ
                I'll keep an eye out.

      Jan shakes his hand. Franz winks at Kathy.

                          FRANZ (CONT'D)
                (to Kathy) It's finally our time.

      She smiles, soft. Drained of energy.

                          JAN
                Get outta here.

                          FRANZ
                Anything you need you call, okay? He'll
                kill both of us if you don't.

      Franz moves away leaving the two alone. Jan hugs Kathy.

                          JAN
                You come to me... when you're done.

      He kisses her. The bus engines start.

                The Dutch Officer rang before he left.

      The girls clean. Raya sweeps, watching Mara teach Luba how to
      restock the bar. Ivan comes out of the OFFICE. A bag in hand.

      Madeleine's UN Volkswagon pulls up. Milena waits, smiling.

                          MADELEINE
                After we got Irka repatriated, I had some
                calls from other private parties that
                were interested in helping. We've
                gathered $40,000 so far. I've applied for
                matching funds, so that... we can
                completely rebuild this shelter.

                          MILENA
                Separate from the GDA. We run it our way.
                The victims come first.

                          MADELEINE
                Things are changing Kathy.

      Kathy is moved, seeing a light at the end of this. The three
      women stand, united... Then... A SHELTER VOLUNTEER comes out.

                          SHELTER VOLUNTEER
                There's an important call inside.

                             MILENA
                Excuse me.

                No. The call is for Kathy.

                  Remember I can bring you back here the
                  second you fuck up.

      Mara nods. He shakes her hand. Ivan hands her a passport. She
      jumps into the car. It's an odd farewell. Ivan heads back to

      THE OASIS

      He scans the room. His eyes land on Luba. Raya watches Ivan
      nod to Luba. A silent exchange: Luba accepts Mara's role.

      SUDDENLY... HONKING. OUTSIDE a car speeds up.

      The two SUITS from last night appear at the door... Without
      the girls.

186   INT./EXT. KATHY'S UN SUV - SHORT TIME LATER                   186

      Julia and Tanya are FRANTIC, talking fast.

                            JULIA (BROKEN ENGLISH)
                  They take us home. They were so drunk. We
                  run.

                            TANYA (BROKEN ENGLISH)
                  There are more girls! You must to get

      They appeal to Kathy.

                  Oasis Bar. In mountains.

      Kathy eyes Viko. As the girls talk at her, Kathy knows she
      was never going home. THIS is where she needs to be.

                          KATHY
                No. He'll walk. We have no proof they
                were trafficked. Let me talk to them. See
                what else they know.

190   INT. OFFICE - GDA BOSNIA - SHORT TIME LATER                  190

      Laura watches video footage on a TV. Halyna appears on the

                          ASSISTANT
                That's their first cut. I'll pass on your
                notes, and they should have it ready for

      A KNOCK at the door.

      Kathy stands, curt now with Laura. All business.

                          KATHY
                I have no options right now. The GDA is
                more secure than Milena's shelter... Can
                they stay before you do the paperwork?

                          LAURA LEVIN
                They'll go on record?

      Kathy nods. Laura shrugs in assent.

                And you're saying these soldiers brought
                you into Bosnia. Through the border?
                You're sure?

                          JULIA
                Yes. In a van. White van. Like yours.

      They both nod. Emphatic. Kathy thinks...

                          KATHY
                They had uniforms? Like mine?

      The girls nod again. Absolutely sure.

                April 8. I never forget. The day I leave
                my home. We come to Bosnia some day
                later. I know because we stop at the
                border. We were six of us. Men from the
                border, they opened the doors... We give
                them our fake passports. My name was
                Irena Woycek. I thought they would see
                the fake passports, I thought...

      She hesitates, the memories flooding back...

                          JULIA (CONT'D)
                I thought they would save us.

                          VIKO
                If there are records showing those girls
                came through the border with IPTF--

                          KATHY
                Then you have conspiracy to traffick.
                And I can take it to Bill Hynes. That's
                enough to do a raid that will stick.

                          VIKO
                The main border station keeps the logs.

      Kathy heads to her SUV. Viko shakes his head -- points at an
      old TRABBANT (a life-size matchbox car).

194   INT./ EXT. TRABANT - NIGHT                                   194

      The ride is bumpy. Viko shouts over the engine...

                          VIKO
                Best if it looks like a local matter. Get
                more info. You be my UN monitor, okay?

      Kathy smiles, cramped, but appreciative of his help.

195   EXT. BORDER POLICE STATION - NIGHT                           195

      Viko talks to a BORDER COP sitting at an ancient Mac

                This is your first mission. You're eager.
                But we work in a very grey area and that
                can get messy. Everybody wants the UN to
                take the gloves off but they don't want
                us to get our hands dirty. It's a fucking
                Catch-22. So what do we do? We

                look at the bigger picture. You're a
                mother. Fine. I see what you're doing
                with these girls. Maybe that's why you're
                thinking with your heart not your head.
                But you have a chance at a career in the
                international sector. Ride this out. Get
                a promotion. Human Rights in Liberia,
                Afghanistan... I don't give a shit. And
                then, when you're running the show, you
                can implement whatever changes you see
                fit. But right now be smart and shut this

      Viko and Danik emerge, chatting with Ivan. Suddenly...

      Ivan jolts back -- COPS grab him -- He's YELLING --

      Local police spread around the bar, slamming, pushing clients

      steps forward... He looks like he's had a few drinks.

Raya. Standing. Shocked. No idea who to trust anymore. One
last shred left of the dream of escape...

Kathy goes to her. But Raya's eyes dart to... Luba.

Then to Kathy, recognizing the last kind face she saw...

                    BARMAN (BROKEN ENGLISH)

despair... After all she has been through, all the
punishment, all the pain...

Raya holds Luba's gaze - Maybe even she could be convinced...

And Raya starts to step to Kathy... When...

Behind Kathy, an IPTF officer removes his helmet. Mike Sears.
He stares at Raya. Petrifying her.

Kathy sees it in her -- WHIPS around. Mike Sears avoids her
gaze. Kathy turns back to Raya. Moving closer, quietly, out
of earshot of the others...

Raya - Pleading -- Don't do it.

Kathy looks at the all girls. Their eyes flitting between
Mike and Kathy... And she understands...

Kathy REELS around. Grabs Mike by the collar -- SHOVING him
to the door -- SLAMMING him against the wall.

                More often than not, traffickers prey on
                those they know. Banking on the fact that
                a girl will trust them. Traffickers are
                fathers, brothers, sisters, uncles and
                aunts...

      Halyna's face whitens. It hits her...

212   INT. ROMAN AND ZENIA'S APARTMENT - DAY                        212

      Halyna glares at Zenia, who heaves tears.

                          ZENIA (UKRAINIAN)
                I wanted to tell you--

      Halyna silences her with her hand. She walks around the
      apartment, taking it all in. The money is in the details. An
      LCD TV, DVD player. Halyna's hand traces over the things...

                          HALYNA (UKRAINIAN)
                It's how you pay for this...

                Roman, he does... I'm--

      Halyna stiffens. An anger she thought impossible. She grabs a
      vase. She wants to throw it at Zenia, but at the last minute
      she throws it into a wall. Zenia falls as the vase SMASHES.

                          HALYNA (UKRAINIAN)
                How. Could. You... Sell your own blood...

                Where is she?! Where is she!? Whe--

      Roman walks in. Halyna lunges at him. He knocks her onto the
      ground. Zenia crawls to her sister. Roman steps between them.

                          ROMAN (UKRAINIAN)
                She is no longer your sister. Stay away
                from me! Stay away from her!

      Halyna spits in his face. He smacks her. She lifts her hand
      to punch him, but he grabs it and pushes her out the door.

      ON THE STREET

      Halyna bends over, heaving. She runs at the door, banging on
      it. PEDESTRIANS stare. A lunatic's rage in Halyna's eyes.

                for you, but... I love you.

      Kathy can't keep it in anymore. She let's go and cries it all
      out, to the one person she wanted to be so strong for.

      Kathy types. We see the following addresses: "UN CHIEF OF

      She continues typing. CLOSE ON THE SUBJECT LINE:

                The email? It seriously concerned me. The
                level of recklessness she used speaks
                volumes toward her mental state. This is
                for her own good.

                          MADELEINE
                Bullshit. You can't just fire her without

      Something moves -- Behind A CAR -- Flash of A MAN -- Kathy

                Kathy, maybe it's time to come home.

      She hangs her head. Then... A KNOCK at the DOOR. Kathy turns.

      Reaching it, Kathy looks through the EYEHOLE... And exhales.
      She opens the door to... Madeleine Rees.

                you. Then we're talking about a
                conspiracy.

                          KATHY
                They tell me... people disappear. They
                bug my house. I mean, I'm sitting here,
                worried there's a bomb in my car--

                           KATHY
                This isn't just my career, it's my life.
                I don't know if I'm ready to be a
                scapegoat.

                That's exactly what you are.

                          KATHY
                Whose?

      She eyes Madeleine, pointed. Madeleine sits back.

                          MADELEINE
                I don't know what to say to that. Think
                about this. Let me know what you want to
                do. I'll support you either way.

      The girls sleep in their cots, when... BAM! Ivan kicks open
      the door. He throws Raya in. On the ground. The girls wake.

      Ivan. He picks Raya up by the neck. She fights. Luba runs in.

                          RAYA (RUSSIAN)
                I didn't say anything. I never will. Why
                are you doing this? I just want to go
                home. I want to see... Mama... Mama...

      But he kicks Raya in the stomach. She ROARS in pain. He flips
      her over. Shaking her. He looks to the other girls. FURIOUS.

                          IVAN (RUSSIAN)
                This all happened because of you.

      He pulls out a gun. Raya looks to Luba for help. But it's too
      late. Ivan presses the gun to Raya's head.

      He glares into Raya's eyes. A flash of ire.

      Raya reaches again... Luba steps forward, when... BANG!!!!

217   Raya's body falls. Luba turns away. She cups her hand over    217
      her mouth. But a loud cry wails through...

      POLICE cordon off a RIVER BANK. Through an opening we see...

      Viko. Keeping local cops at bay. Behind him is... Kathy. In
      civilian clothes. Standing over a...

      DEAD BODY. Raya. Kathy stares, expressionless. Viko clears
      the cops out. Kathy turns, and retches. She pulls air into
      lungs, then straightens. She looks up to the trees, the apex
      of this leafy cathedral, as if invoking some higher power.

236   INT. MADELEINE REES' OFFICE - DAY                             236

      Kathy holds an envelope. Hynes' SECRETARY looks at Kathy.
      MUFFLED SCREAMING from his office. Kathy leaves the letter.

                          SECRETARY
                Ms. Bolkovac... I, me and the other
                secretaries... Your email was the bravest
                thing anyone's even done in this mission.

      Kathy nods, truly appreciating that. She walks away, her
      silhouette growing smaller and smaller down the hall.

      The secretary takes Kathy's letter. Walking into

      BILL HYNES' OFFICE

      Bill paces around Rick Jones, Ambassador Wells and John
      Morgan. Hynes grabs Kathy's letter.

                          CARMEN
                Kath... my parents really need the money
                I send home. It's a lifesaver for them.

      Out of date, and under-stocked, the store is as spruce as a
      little post-war TLC could make it. Kathy stands at a counter,
      where a CLERK puts down a chunky PORTABLE CASSETTE RECORDER.

                  WITH MR. HYNES ABOUT ME.

                  THAT IS TOTALLY UNTRUE! WHO TOLD YOU
                  THAT? I BARELY RECOGNIZE YOUR NAME. I
                  CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW.

      The PLANE ENGINES are roaring. Kathy can't hear him. She
      slams down the phone. Staring at the recorder. Thinking.

242   INT./EXT.   UN SUV/ UNMHQ PARKING LOT - DAY                     242

      Kathy, parked. Rips open a CASSETTE TAPE. She looks at her
      personage - this isn't fitting anywhere.

      RAIN hits the windshield. The glass becomes blurry in the
      haze of water. Kathy grabs a UN windbreaker from the back.
      Sticks the recorder in its pocket.

      Kathy walks down the hall. Feeling it close in on her.
      Turning a corner, to...

      KATHY'S OFFICE

      Peter Ward stands in front. He can't look her in the eye.

      Kathy slips her hand into her pocket. Fumbling... Then looks
      up. She's got it. ECU of TAPE WHEELS turning. Kathy moves
      forward. Coming closer, she sees behind Peter...

      A NOTICE ON THE DOOR: GENDER OFFICE SHUT DOWN.

      Peter hands Kathy an envelope. Looking up... Apologetic. She
      reads, stunned.

                          KATHY
                Timesheet Violations? They are firing me
                for time sheet violations!!!

                You should go.

                          KATHY
                I'm not going anywhere. Not without an
                investigation. Madeleine Rees is--

                          PETER WARD
                Hynes has sent a delegate to Vienna to
                have Madeleine Rees removed.

      Kathy is stopped short.

                          PETER WARD (CONT'D)
                State Department auditors are here.
                Asking for files on trafficking,
                prostitution and time sheets.

      Kathy stops. Realizing...

                          KATHY
                Can you repeat that?

      He looks around, nervous.

                          PETER WARD
                Look, this is between you and me, but
                Dyncorp and the State Department... you
                know it's a dual thing, and this is the
                action they have taken, whether right or
                wrong... I'm being told to do this.
                                                       TWB 108.


                    KATHY
          So you're saying the State Department is
          instructing Dyncorp to fire me.

Peter nods. And Kathy has what she needs.

                    KATHY (CONT'D)
          Please... can I just go in for one
          minute, get my personal belongings.

She eyes him. Knowing who he is inside. He shouldn't... But
Peter opens the door. Kathy goes in

KATHY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Closes the door behind her. Rushing   -- to the File Cabinet --
takes out her keys -- TO THE BOTTOM   DRAWER -- Kathy pushes
back FRONT FILES -- Takes FILES OUT   -- Looking around -- --
She grabs a GYM BAG -- STUFFS IN AS   MANY FILES AS SHE CAN.

She zips up the bag. Looks at the door. Still closed. She...

TAKES OUT HER TAPE RECORDER. Huddles down behind her desk...
PRESSES PLAY. But all she hears is FUZZ.

                    PETER WARD
          Kathy.

She turns. Peter stands over her. Eyeing the tape recorder.

                    PETER WARD (CONT'D)
          Scrambling devices.

She looks at him, waiting for his next move. His eyes soften.

                    PETER WARD (CONT'D)
          It probably won't work in most of the
          rooms. Now c'mon. Get out of here.

She smiles, silently thanking him. She shoves the recorder in
her pocket. Grabs the bag. Thrown by it's heaviness. Peter
helps her get it on her shoulder.

He ushers her out. Locking the door behind them. They move

DOWN THE HALL

When Rick Jones barrels after them. Waving Kathy's appeal.
IPTF OFFICERS come out of their office. Kathy rushes into

THE ELEVATOR

Quickly looking around THE METAL PANELING. She drops the bag.
An ECHO REVERBERATES through the HOLLOW SHAFT. Kathy turns...

      Again slipping her hand in her pocket. This time determined.

                          RICK JONES
                I'm gonna tell you this in front of him
                and everybody else, you no longer have a
                UN ID. You no longer have a UN job. You
                do not have a job with the Department of
                State. The Department of State holds your
                contract. They are the ones who are
                pulling it. You will not have an appeal.
                You will not have a hearing. You will not
                have anything. Do you understand?

      Kathy lets the doors close without saying a word...

      Kathy sits across from JOANNA PAUL SMITH. Eyeing her gym bag.

                          JOANNA PAUL SMITH (BRITISH ACCENT)
                I've been working at Human Rights Watch
                for fifteen years. We've been keeping
                close tabs on this. No one has come
                forward with anything solid before.

                          KATHY
                I have everything you need. When I arrive
                in Amsterdam safely, I will go on record.

      Joanna nods, a glimmer of admiration. Kathy stands, shakes
      her hand, and leaves... Disappearing into the crowd.

      Kathy drives alone. Checking the rearview mirror.

      A car pulls up behind her. It's bright light blinds Kathy.
      The car closes in on her. She winces, but... The car passes.

      It's just Kathy on the road. The gym bag on the seat beside
      her. The culmination of everything she's been fighting for.

      Her red tail lights disappear into a dark mountain tunnel.

                employer, Dyncorp, to an industrial

      around, nervous. Then she spots... Mara.

                Ivan let you go. This is what you do now.

      Luba nods, understanding.

      BACK IN THE COURTROOM

      Karen squeezes Kathy's hand. Kathy looks to the back of the
      courtroom... Erin smiles at Kathy. So proud.

      JUDGE SWISS holds up Kathy's TAPE RECORDER...

      Kathy straightens. The Judge reads from a VERDICT. Karen's
      face lights up. Kathy's won. Jan breathes, relieved.

                You both worked here?

      Mara looks at Luba, a 'do or die' look in her eye. Hiding her
      shame, she gathers her strength for this lie.

                          LUBA (UKRAINIAN)
                Yes. It will change your life.

      AND IN THE COURTROOM

      FLASHBULBS pop as Kathy stands... Pleased, but not elated.

      The Dyncorp team files out. As the judges stand, one of them
      eyes Kathy. And they connect. As only true lawmen do.

      But in this moment, the Judge, Kathy and us... We all know...
      She never wanted to win. She just wanted to do her job.

                             TIM SEBASTIAN
                   We talked to Bill Hynes, who was the
                   senior UN official in Bosnia at the time,
                   we talked to him a year ago, on this
                   program about some of your allegations.
                   He said they weren't true at all. He said
                   'We've had senior officials from New
                   York, we've had investigations from the
                   State Department... I can now
                   categorically say that not a single UN
                   official was involved in trafficking'.

                             KATHY
                   I think that Mr. Hynes knows this is a
                   false statement.

                             TIM SEBASTIAN
                   So you're accusing him of lying. That not
                   a single word he said is true.

                             KATHY
                   I watched that... Yes.

      Tim shifts. Kathy sits calm.

                             TIM SEBASTIAN
                   Would you do it again?

                             KATHY
                   Yes I would. No doubt about it... I would
                   definitely do it again. I'm not the type
                   of person who would... As a law
                   enforcement officer, I am held to a
                   higher standard.

AFTER A TWO YEAR BATTLE, A BRITISH TRIBUNAL RULED THAT
KATHRYN BOLKOVAC MADE A PROTECTED DISCLOSURE AND WAS UNFAIRLY
DISMISSED BY DYNCORP FOR BLOWING THE WHISTLE.

KATHRYN BOLKOVAC IS YET TO BE RE-HIRED IN THE INTERNATIONAL
SECTOR. HER NAME WOULD THREATEN AN INSTITUTION'S FUNDING.

IN 2003, DYNCORP WON A MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR CONTRACT IN IRAQ.
THIS IN ADDITION TO CONTRACTS IN COLUMBIA, LIBERIA AND
AFGHANISTAN.

TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS IS A GLOBAL CRIME. OVER TWO MILLION
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TRAFFICKED FOR THE PURPOSE OF SEXUAL
SLAVERY. THE NUMBER OF UNKNOWN CASES ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL.

PLEASE STOP THE TRAFFIC.
