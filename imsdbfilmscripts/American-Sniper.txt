    an entire MARINE COMPANY advances over the top of us.


2   EXT. STREET, FALLUJAH, IRAQ - DAY                           2

    The sun melts over squat residences on a narrow street.
    MARINE COMPANY creeps toward us like a cautious Goliath.
    FOOT SOLDIERS walk alongside Humvees and tanks.

    Sun glints off a slab of corrugated steel. Beneath it--

    CHRIS KYLE lays prone, dick in the dirt, eye to the glass
    of a .300 Win-Mag sniper rifle. He's Texas stock with a
    boyish grin, blondish goatee and vital blue eyes. Both
    those eyes are open as he tracks the scene below,
    sweating his ass off in the shade of steel.

                              CHRIS KYLE
                 Fucking hot box.

    GOAT (24, Arkansas Marine) lies beside him, woodsy and
    outspoken, watching dirt-devils swirl in the street.

                 Dirt over here tastes like dog shit.

    Goat balks and fixes his M4 on the rooftop door.

    CHRIS SCOPE POV

    TRACK ACROSS bombed-out buildings, twisted metal and
    golden-domed mosques. Ragged curtains flutter out a
    window. Cat-tails on the river sway the same direction.
    We see him studying windage; we see what he's thinking--

          I got a military-aged male, on a cell
          phone, watching the convoy. Over.

                       COMMANDING OFFICER (OS)
          If you think he's reporting troop
          movement you have a green-light. Your
          call. Over.

MAN ON CELL studies the convoy, his hair tossed by wind.
CROSS-HAIR push left of target, compensating for windage.

SFX: Chris takes a deep inhale, holds it, then expels.

His finger is taking up trigger-slack when the man dips
his shoulder slightly. Chris holds off as--

                 (keys mike)
          He stepped off.

Chris sucks air. Close. The ambient world floods back in.
Barked orders, diesel engines and--

A WOMAN AND KID exit the same structure. They're headed
up the sidewalk but cut sharply into the street.

                       CHRIS KYLE
                 (keys mike)
          Hold up. I got a woman and a kid, 200
          yards out, moving toward the convoy.

(ECU)-- The woman cradles something beneath her robes.

                       CHRIS KYLE
          Her arms aren't swinging. She's carrying
          something.

CROSS-HAIRS ON WOMAN as she pulls a cylindrical object
from her robes. His vision obscured but--

                       CHRIS KYLE
          She just pulled a grenade. An RKG Russian
          grenade. I think she gave it to the kid.

    MOTHER motions the Kid to hurry along (ECU)-- her robes
    flutter, trash blows in the street, the dust off her

    YOUNG MARINES. Wading into war. Boots scuffing dirt.

    CLOSE ON CHRIS

    His exhale hisses from tobacco-stained teeth. Breathe it
    down. He struggles to get calm, fighting for control.
    SFX: THUMP-THUMP THUMP-THUMP THUMP--

    CROSS-HAIRS left of the running target, leading him,
    compensating for a dozen different considerations as--

    He pauses upon exhale. The world goes quiet. Landscape
    pulses with color and focus. He stokes the trigger and--

    THE BULLET

    Leaps from the barrel. Cracks like a whip. The .300 round
    hurls forward, glinting as it enters the flesh of--

    It staggers, draws and topples to the ground. We are--


4   EXT. HILLS, WEST TEXAS - PRE-DAWN                           4

    A field shrouded in fog. CHRIS KYLE(8) jumps from a deer
    blind, innocent and excited, running toward the buck.

               Get back here.

    Chris stops, turns back. WAYNE KYLE, his father, is
    sturdy and earnest with mutton chops and Texas calm.

                            WAYNE
               Don't ever leave your gun in the dirt.

               Yes, sir.

                            WAYNE
               Helluva shot, son. You got a gift. You're
               gonna make a fine hunter someday.

    Chris nods, clear-eyed, as if hearing the whisper of
    destiny. He grabs the .30-06, running again, bounding to--

    THE BUCK

    Glassy brown eyes look up at Chris. It's still alive.

                            WAYNE
               Everything dies to give life.

               Can it see me?

                            WAYNE
               It's a deer, son.

               You shot it, you deal with it.

    Chris straddles the deer. It tries to gouge him. He looks
    frightened but drags the blade across its neck.

                       (her hand smudged with paint)
                What the hell is on your neck?

      She pulls at his collar to reveal GREEN SPRAY-PAINT
      upside his neck.

                             CHRIS
                Would you believe me if I told you I was
                painted green and on an IV two hours ago?
                           (03.18.14)                       25.


                          TAYA
             What do you--

Then she sees BIGGLES, DAUBER, "D" and SQUIRREL rolling
with laughter at the bar, and remembers who she married.

                          CHRIS
                    (smiles)
             Package deal babe.

He dances her away from them and pulls his jacket aside,
flashing his boys the Trident pinned to his chest.

AT THE BAR

TONY bowls up; once their instructor, now their Chief.

                          "D"
             What's the word, Chief?

                    (looks them over)
             It's on boys. Just got the call.

They hoist their drinks, barking approval, "HOOYAH!"

ON DANCE FLOOR

Taya sees the nod from Biggles to Chris, we're going. She
tenses up in his arms, her feet growing heavy.

                          CHRIS
             They say it'll be over in 6 weeks.

                          TAYA
             I'm so afraid.

                          CHRIS
             Don't be afraid. It's all part of the
             plan.

He pulls her close, HIS EYES FIXED on someone else--

                          TAYA
             Your heart is beating out of your chest.

                          CHRIS
                    (nods, looking past her)

     CAKE CUTTING - EVENING

     The boat rocks on choppy water. Taya dabs cake on Chris's
     nose and they kiss. THE BOOM of distant fireworks is
     followed by AIR-RAID SIRENS as shock & awe hit Baghdad.

                                                  CUT TO BLACK.

     SOLDIERS sit elbow to elbow. 6 SEAL SNIPERS and A SQUAD
     OF MARINES to watch their backs. CHRIS tucks the little
     blue Bible and American flag and into his webbing then
     removes his wedding band, hanging it from his necklace.

     MARC LEE AO2 (26) is a poster-boy Navy Seal, soulful and
     handsome. He glows like a halo in a river full of shit.

               You snipers will be paired with a man to

               to protect those Marines at all costs.

     The truck battles to a stop.

               The city was evacuated. Any military-aged

     A gunmetal sky. The staccato pop of GUNFIRE in the

      CHRIS walks upright. The Marine paired with Chris is a
      mouthy Arkansas boy, "WINSTON", skitters tree to tree.

                             WINSTON

                A sniper won't aim for your head.

      A DOZEN MARINES are posted outside an apartment complex.

                             WINSTON

     Bounds out of the bathroom, runs out the apartment door
     and leaps OVER THE RAILING, falling six floors.

     CHRIS and WINSTON look down to the lobby, where Marines
     stand around the DEAD GOAT.

     Under a corrugated piece of steel, a ritual unfolds--

     Chris packs a dip. He lays out his Bible and flag. Loads
     bullets in a wrist-sheath. Starts to marshal his breath.

Barked orders, diesel engines and--

A WOMAN AND KID exit the same structure. They're headed
up the sidewalk but cut sharply into the street.

MOTHER motions him to hurry along (ECU)-- her robes
flutter, trash blows in the street, the dust off her

THE KID sprints toward the Marines.

YOUNG MARINES. Wading into war. Boots scuffing dirt.

His eyes water with focus, his exhale hisses from tobacco-
stained teeth. Breathe it down. He struggles to get calm.

CROSS-HAIRS left of the running target, leading him,
compensating for a dozen different considerations as--

piece of him that just died.

CHRIS SCOPE POV

MOTHER flees down sidewalk, robes aflutter. CROSS-HAIRS
lead her. BAM. It pocks wall behind her. A round ejects.
CROSS-HAIRS swing forward, leads her more. BAM. She runs
into scope, reaches center, meets bullet. A red mist.

     This is the reality of war. Not like he anticipated.

     CLOSE ON CHRIS

     Breath racing. Bleeding sweat. Trying to process his
     disgust. Trying to inject some purpose, mumbling:
     Protect the Marines. Protect the Marines. Protect...

     Clouds crawl over Chris like ghosts, swirling feverishly
     as HOURS SLIDE BY. His face takes on a preternatural
     blankness as he begins to slip into the shadows of self.

     Chris lays atop a baby crib. A scrim hangs in front of

CROSS-HAIRS TRACK across the city-scape. TIME LAPSES and
the world (in scope) SPEEDS UP. Humvees and tanks streak
past, lights blur, trees blow in choppy havoc, then--

CROSS-HAIRS drift off him and TIME SPEEDS UP, dogs eat a
rotting body by the roadside, vicious in fast motion. TWO
WOMEN wobble down the road with buckets, wind whips
roadside grass into a tizzy and WE HALT ON--

CROSS-HAIRS ON A PERFECT CIRCLE in the grass, a rifle-
barrel? Stay on it. In stillness it finds context; a
RUSTY PIPE. TIME SPEEDS FORWARD, TWO BOYS zip by on a
Vespa, OLD MEN frantically bow to mecca on rooftops.
Clouds boil across dawn sky. His eye never leaves glass.

            Well, I don't know what a Koran looks
            like but I can describe what he was

acutely aware of what this war is costing him.

     the hall by his hair. WIFE and KIDS screaming. "D" holds
     them off as-- Chris dumps the father at a STASH HOLE in
     the floor. Inside, a CACHE OF AKs, RPGs, IED components.

ALLEY

TWO MEN stand by a 12 foot wall. A dark shape sprints

                We're headed to the roof. Secure the van.

      THE VAN

      DAUBER and TONY cover MARC LEE and "D" as they open the
      back of the van. Inside, flats of RED CLAY TILES.

                             "D"
                The Butcher is building a 7-11?

      Marc rips off the top layer, finds: 200,000 ROUNDS AMMO.

                No ammo, no jihad.

      ROOFTOP

      Drying sheets billow on crisscrossing wires. Chris tracks
      blood-drops to the ledge. The next roof 15 feet off.

                             BIGGLES
                How the hell'd he make that?

                So much for leading us to the Butcher.

Chris pulls his mask down. He has a beard and the sturm
und drang of war are writ loud on his face.

DISTANT BALUSTRADE

MUSTAFA lays prone, mumbles a prayer and takes two deep
breaths before putting his eye to the scope.

MUSTAFA SCOPE POV

CROSS-HAIRS TACK to fluttering sheets, the wind revealed
in their billow. TWO FIGURES are cloaked there,
indistinguishable heads peaking over laundry lines.

He aims left-and-above the head closest to him.

ON THE ROOF

Chris and Biggles stand among the billowing sheets.

                       CHRIS
          She'll take it to Zales and try to find
          out how much your spent.

          She's not like that.

          It's giant, bro. Four karats. It had to
          belong to one of Saddam's bitches--

Chris is laughing when he sees a FLASH OF GLASS in the
distance. Before he can utter a warning--

A GUNSHOT SOUNDS

The bullet flays the muzzle of Biggles M4. Shrapnel
enters his face. Biggles goes down in a red mist--

                       CHRIS
          No!--

The right side of his face is a pulpy cavity. His eye
socket obliterated. He appears mortally wounded.

      He drags him one way, then another. He can't see past the
      blood-spackled sheets. A SHOT pocks the roof at his feet.

      Biggles pulls himself up, tilting his head forward to not
      choke on his own blood. With heroic effort, he stumbles
      to the stairs. Chris, stunned he's alive, ducks an arm--

      METALLICA, "Master of Puppets" blasts as an M1A2 ABRAMS
      TANK speeds 45 mph down a street, bad as fuck. TWO
      BRADLEY TRANSPORT vehicles follow.

      A CAR pulls into the road ahead. INSURGENT PASSENGER
      leans out, FIRING AN RPG. It explodes across the tank but
      does no damage. Tank still coming, Insurgents pull away--

      But the tank catches them. Treads climbing the back of
      the car, overtaking it. INSURGENTS are trying to get out,
      screaming, as steel folds around them and flattens them.

      And the ABRAMS vaults off the other side--

THE PUNISHERS pour out of their Bradleys, rolling in both

LONG HALLWAY

Ominously still. Sunlight spills through grated windows

      INSURGENTS pass in droves in the street below.

                             RANGER ONE (OS)
                The streets are crawling. Hold your fire.

      Across the roof, "D" on a .50 BMG looking at the MILE-
      WIDE SANDSTORM pushing toward Baghdad.

                             "D"
                Enter the fuckin sandman.

      CHRIS

      3rd floor. In a fruit locker. Breath racing. Hands
      tremoring. Electricity coursing through him.

      Gun pointed north, Chris searches nearby buildings for
      the sniper. PUSH BEHIND HIM, SIX-BLOCKS SOUTH to--

      T-WALL

      A CRANE lowers a T-block. ARMY ENGINEERS guide it in.

      ENEMY CROSS-HAIRS ENTER FRAME (REVERSE ANGLE)

      ARMY ENGINEERS in the street signal success and ANOTHER
      ENGINEER scurries up the neck of the crane to release the
      chain. The cross-hairs track the MOVING ENGINEER and--
                        (03.18.14)                         101.


BOOM! A shot echoes across the landscape and TOPPLES THE
ENGINEER from the crane. He lands dead in the street.

CHRIS

Hears it, pulls off the gun, looking behind him.

                       CHRIS
          No--
                 (keys mike)
          It came from behind us. We went the wrong
          way. He's south of the wall.

          Doesn't matter. Hold your fire. We got
          uglies right below us--

Chris repositions himself, FACING SOUTH-- he lowers his
eye to glass, bleeding sweat, aiming toward Baghdad.

CHRIS SCOPE POV (BOTH EYES VIEW)

CROSS-HAIRS track to distant rooftops. Everything wobbles
and fumes. Trash blows, fronds sway, curtains flap,
mirage boils-- all gusting different directions.

Almost by accident, he lands on an IMPOSSIBLY SMALL
SHAPE. Person? A bag of trash? Or nothing at all. As
small as a pepper-flake inside the radius of his scope.

                       CHRIS (OC)
                 (into mike)
          I got something. 1900 yards out.

          You can't even see that far out. Hold
          your fire. You'll expose us all.

He twitches and wobbles off-target by a city block.

                       "D" (OS)
          He's right, Legend. No bueno.

CROSS-HAIRS tracking back, measuring between mil-

ENEMY SNIPER HIDE

THE SNIPER is covered in a black Hefty bag disguising his
presentation, and identity. Ready to kill again.

                        CHRIS (OS)
                  (over radio)

Trying to breathe it down, please god, breathe it down--

           Quick Reaction Force is 20 minutes out.
           You will stand the fuck down--

Chris scoops dust off the floor and watches with his off-
eye, as it blows off his palm and plumes outward.

                        "D"
           It's your call, Chris.

SNIPER SCOPE POV

CHRIS' SCOPE POV

CROSS-HAIRS wobble on the dark shape a mile away.

CLOSE ON SNIPER

Face obscured, a PRAYER HISSES from his bearded mouth.

CLOSE ON CHRIS

Both eyes open, a PRAYER WHISPERS across his lips.

                         CHRIS
          For Biggles.

CLOSE ON SNIPER/CLOSE ON CHRIS

SFX: Thump-thump....Thump-BAM!

Chris fires first. The shot echoes across eternity. One,
two, three seconds later. A red-mist paints the wind.

THE SNIPER tumbles off his platform and out of view.

                         CHRIS KYLE
          Tango down.

The world rushing back in, he hears INSURGENTS below.

STREET BELOW FACTORY

INSURGENTS point up at the building, yelling, rushing in--

ROOFTOP

Chris bangs onto the roof, shaken, joining a 6 MAN SQUAD.

                       RANGER ONE
          You just fucked us, Legend--
                 (screams into mike)

          We are fucked like a football bat.

                       "D"
          Mission accomplished. Biggles be proud.

A look between them, fully aware of what comes next.

CHRIS and Squad set-up firing stations.

                       CHRIS
          There are two ways onto the roof. We
          cover both stairways and conserve ammo.

Muted nods all around. Footsteps coming. This is it.

                       "D"
          If you FNGs shit your pants, don't stop
          shooting. Scoop and shoot. Scoop and--

GUNFIRE POPS behind them. MARINE GUNNER lights it up.

          Conserve--

OPPOSITE DOOR bangs open across the roof. Chris hammers
the INSURGENT but he keeps coming, drugged up. TWO MORE
roll out behind him, on the same glue.

This is close-quarter contact, visceral and savage.

IN THE STREET

INSURGENTS enter surrounding buildings in droves.

Wind kicking up. Ammo running out. Insurgents keep
coming. Worst environment imaginable.

      INSURGENTS use rebar to cross from a nearby rooftop. Two
      ways just became three. They're swarming them.

      Hand-to-hand chaos. A bad way to die.

In their exchange, an unspoken goodbye. Then--

Chris struggles to dial, hands shaking. IT RINGS. He

THE SANDSTORM

Has shifted. A tsunami of dirt is about to swallow them.

F-18 RAPTOR

THE PILOT flying into the storm. Sensors screaming. He
can't hold his line. 4, 3, 2-- He pulls up early.

ROOFTOP

HELLFIRE MISSILES scream over the Banana factory and
EXPLODE INTO the next building. Fire and dirt engulf
them. The blast recedes but the sand-storm escalates.

                       CHRIS
          Go, go, let's move--

He leads "D", RANGER ONE and FOUR OTHERS across the roof.
They stumble past INSURGENTS, blinded by sand.

STREET BELOW

CHRIS and SQUAD stagger into HOWLING CHAOS, clinging to
each other, trailing Chris as GUNFIRE POPS behind them.

      past. He   sheds flack-jacket and webbing, Bible and flag.
      He drops   his gun in the dirt and dives. His hand clutches
      the last   rung of slat-armor and--

      Chris Kyle is dragged off the battlefield.

      IN THE STREET

      Sand buries the METALLIC TOY SOLDIER that followed him
      since childhood. Wind whips pages of the Bible and pulls
      at the flag until it flaps unfolded. WE'RE BLOWN AWAY
      with it, twisting and clapping into an otherworldy beige.

      IN THE STORM

      We catch glimpses of the city below: graffiti'd T-walls,
      a cracked expanse of desert floor and the lanky body of
      an enemy sniper splayed across a rooftop.

      Wind rips the Hefty bag away and sand pocks the DEAD FACE
      OF MUSTAFA-- before we're swept up into the howling rage.

       an injured soldier calls for help amid shocking gunfire.

       TRACKING BEHIND THE TV, we see Chris' wrought face and a
       household bustling around him. COLTON carries party
       plates outside, MCKENNA fights to get cowboy boots on and-

       TAYA CALLS to him from the kitchen but we can't hear her
       until the CAMERA TRACKS to HER POV-- the gunfire is gone,

      THE SHEEPDOG jumps on the back of COLTON'S FRIEND. The
      boy goes down hard, gets up crying, running from the dog.

      is cuts into scene. THE BOY'S MOM runs over. His back
