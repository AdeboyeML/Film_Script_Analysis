          days when I first entered my
          pupillage. I had the very good
          fortune of serving as a junior to
          Mr Justice Stancombe
          Graham's not listening any more. He's looking around the

          to mind the old adage a fronte

          Everything seems to slow down, the judge's mouth moving
          more and more sluggishly, though his voice remains the
          same. The effect is strange .. then the sound of laughter.

          This is the day.
          Everyone looks round at him. He's almost as surprised as
          they are that he's spoken out loud.

          I'm afraid you'll be on a waiting
          list for at least six months.

                         MURIEL
          At my age, I can't plan that far

          There is another way. Our
          hospital trust is funding a new
          pilot scheme, that will enable us
          to out-source you to another
          hospital, where they can perform
          the procedure almost immediately,
          and at a fraction of the cost.

          Evelyn stops. They've reached the terminal.

          The passengers from Flight 1045 to Delhi are seated at the

          Muriel is wheeled up by an attendant and parked at the end
          of the only remaining row of empty chairs. Douglas and
          Jean are already sitting there.
          Jean smiles politely as Graham sits down a couple of seats
          away.
          Norman arrives, carrying his battery radio, sees an empty
          place between Jean and Madge, who is sitting at the end.
          He smiles knowingly at Madge as he sits.
          Finally Evelyn takes the only available space, between
          Graham and Douglas.
          And there the seven passengers wait patiently, unaware of
          their common fate.
          The sound of a jet engine, quiet at first, finally engulfs
          them.

          Obviously one's read one's
          Kipling, but we view this as an
          opportunity to explore another
          culture, as well as making new
          friends. And a retired judge is
          just the class of guest one was

          one's guidebooks.
          Jean blinks. Evelyn and Graham share a smile. Douglas
          hides his. And Madge sees it all.
          As they head towards the baggage carousel, they're met by
          Muriel and Norman, emerging from the elevator. Norman is
          pushing Muriel's wheelchair.

          actually be right. The country

          Moments later. Our heroes are in the middle of an
          extraordinary scene. Stifling heat, deafening noise; the
          chaos, the bustle, the grime, the crowds, the life.
          They're surrounded by taxi drivers, baggage
          handlers,beggars etc. All clamouring for their attention.
          Evelyn looks a little shocked. Jean is traumatized, a

          Muriel's wheelchair is strapped to the back of the bus,
          which is screaming down the six-lane highway. A huge tower
          of luggage is piled precariously on the roof.
          The road appears to be complete chaos; cars, buses, even
          cows overtaking each other.
          The bus pulls into the outside lane to follow a truck which
          is overtaking some slower vehicles. As the truck pulls back
          into the inside lane, it reveals a huge truck barrelling
          towards them on the wrong carriageway.

          extraordinary.

          32 EXT. BUS - DAWN 32

          The sun rises. A beautiful, pearly dawn.
          The bus drives through the great gates of Jaipur. Below,
          the city shimmers in the heat. It's a magnificent sight.

          EVELYN (O.S.)
          What exactly is a tuk-tuk?

          33 EXT. JAIPUR STREET - DAWN 33

          Our heroes are squashed into a pair of them, facing
          forwards and backwards, attempting not to swallow too much
          dust as they wheel crazily through the teeming morning
          streets of the city. They stare in amazement at the world
          racing past them.
          A scooter overtakes. A young man is driving, his
          girlfriend riding side-saddle on the back. Her sari
          billows out behind her. Douglas and Evelyn both watch her,
          struck by this image of beauty, youth and vitality.

          34 EXT. STREET/GARDEN PATH. MARIGOLD HOTEL - MORNING 34

          The tuk-tuks have pulled up, and our travellers emerge,
          exhausted and dirty, staring through some garden gates at
          the Marigold Hotel. Once a beautiful building, once
          possibly even luxurious, it is clearly in the process of
          being given at least half the face-lift it badly needs.
          Parts of the building are freshly painted, some of the
          ornate balconies are crumbling, and one wall is clad with
          crazily skewed bamboo scaffolding. A huge old tree towers
          over an untended garden, its branches poking into the
          windows of the building.

          34A EXT. ROOFTOP. MARIGOLD HOTEL - MORNING 34A

          A young man leans out from an upper balcony to see the
          arrival below: SONNY KAPOOR (early 20's).
          He deposits a paint pot and brush on a parapet, and races
          off across the rooftop.

          34B EXT. GARDEN PATH/COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - MORNING 34B

          Dazed and horrified, the travellers wander up the pathway.
          A cow standing in front of them is pushed into the garden
          by a couple of young houseboys who then run to the tuk-tuks
          to collect their luggage.

          Sonny clatters down the steep steps, and comes tearing out
          onto a verandah, as the travellers arrive in the courtyard
          below. He spreads his arms wide.

                         SONNY
          Welcome to India!!!
          They stare up at him.

          35 EXT/INT. COURTYARD/HALLWAY.BEDROOM. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 35

          The courtyard is not without charm, although somewhat
          delapidated. A fountain at the centre does not look as if
          it has seen water in years, and faded awnings are strung up
          haphazardly.
          Sonny is leading Madge into the darkness of the building,
          towards her room.

                         SONNY
          This is a building of the utmost
          character, which means that
          perhaps not everything will
          function in the way you expect it
          to. But as the manager and chief
          executive supervising officer of
          the Marigold Hotel, I can tell
          you with great pride that the
          building has stood for centuries,
          and will stand for many more, in
          100% shipshape condition. Please
          follow me, carefully avoiding
          that naughty stone there
          round this corner, leading us
          most successfully all the way to
          . your bedroom!
          The room is very small, comfortable, and tastefully
          decorated. But there's no door.

                         MADGE
          Where?

          What you're showing me here is an
          alcove.

                         SONNY
          The door is coming soon, most
          definitely.

          Let us not concern ourselves with
          details, Mrs Hardcastle. Rather
          than speaking of doors, we should
          instead take pleasure in the
          freedom to roam.

                         MADGE
          Does your room have a door?

                         SONNY
          Oh yes.

                         MADGE
          Then that's where I'll be

          Douglas and Jean arrive at their room. Douglas goes in
          through the arched doorway, promptly comes back out again.

                         DOUGLAS
          Bird in the room! Bird in the

          Jean pushes him aside, goes on in. Several pigeons are
          flying around in some panic.

          Evelyn arrives at her room, goes on in.
          The room is light and airy. And rather nice. But all the
          furniture is covered in sheets.
          As Evelyn stands there, Sonny comes rushing in, yanks all
          the sheets off, and runs out again.

          Muriel swivels her chair around. Graham is just going into
          his room.

           Norman is laboriously climbing the stairs to his room. He
          stops, catches his breath.

          40 EXT. TERRACE, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 40

          Ajit is attempting to explain himself to Muriel.

          My what?

                         AJIT
          Your physiotherapist. To help

          41 EXT. ROOF, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 41

          Norman comes out onto the roof of the hotel. His room is
          right in front of him, a kind of penthouse cabin. A bed,
          but not much else. The trees poke in through the open
          window.
          He walks through the room, hangs his battery radio on a
          hook and leans out of the balcony, surveying the view.

          Of course I had hoped that by now

          India we have a saying:

          end. So if it is not alright,
          then it is not yet the end.

                         JEAN
          What will start to make this
          alright is for you to give us a
          refund.

          Of course if that is what you
          desire, you must have it.
          Absolutely no problem, I will
          refund you completely.

          Graham is taking some things out of his bag: an old map of
          Jaipur, sepia-tinted photographs of a British family during
          the Raj, official documents yellowing with age.
          He picks up a photograph, looks at it.

          the conversion from virtual to
          actual proved sufficiently
          viable, then she would be able to

          Gentle friends, you have found
          your way to this place,
          bequeathed to me by my beloved
          father, that I have raised from
          the ruins of his broken dreams,
          and renamed The Best Exotic
          Marigold Hotel For The Elderly
          And Beautiful. Yes, I use the
          words most deliberately...
          Norman is not looking very well at all. Sonny doesn't
          notice, keeps on going.

                         SONNY (CONT'D)
          .You have all heard the chimes
          at midnight, and long in tooth
          have youbecome. Who knowshow
          many daysyou have left?But we
          are mosthonoured that youhave
          chosen tospend that time with
          us.
          Norman's head suddenly tips forward, and he falls from his
          chair onto the floor.

          General panic. Everybody crowds round, but no one knows
          what to do.

                         SONNY (CONT'D)
          Let me through, please. My
          brother is a doctor.
          He kneels next to Norman, and checks his watch as he feels
          for a pulse.
          Everybody waits. And then

                         SONNY (CONT'D)
          This man is dead.
          An appalled silence.

                         SONNY (CONT'D)
          Please, we must cover his face.
          We should preserve his dignity at
          this terrible moment.
          Madge looks around. All there is is a napkin. She passes
          it Sonny, who lays it over the face of Norman.
          Who promptly coughs.

                         DOUGLAS
          He just coughed. I heard him
          cough!

                         EVELYN
          He moved! He's alive!

                         MADGE
          He's fainted, that's all.
          Sonny shakes his watch next to his ear. It's stopped.
          Norman sits up.

                         NORMAN
          What's going on? Did I nod off?
          Everyone crowds round Norman, helps lift him back up.
          Except Muriel. She just stares at them all.

                         MURIEL
          Hell. I'm in hell.

          47 EXT. STREET. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAWN 47

          The sun rises. A washer-man bicycles up to the hotel, a
          load of clean sheets balanced on his handlebars.
          Shopkeepers on the street are beginning to set out their
          wares.

          Evelyn is typing - hunt and peck - at her computer. Beside
          her, the classified pages of the local newspaper.

          EVELYN (V.0.)

          49 EXT. STREET, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 49

          A sign reads: 'THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL FOR THE

          Sonny affixes a sticker: 'NOW WITH GUESTS!'

          accustomed to the storm of car

          50 EXT. STREET, CENTRAL JAIPUR - DAY 50

          The main road in Jaipur is chaotically busy. Crowds,
          bikes, cows, dust, noise, and laughter.
          Sonny's battered old car has broken down. Madge is in the
          front seat, Douglas and Jean in the back.
          Sonny is aiming a couple of kicks at the engine.

          EVELYN (V.0.)
          Can there be anywhere else in the
          world that is such an assault on

          51 EXT/INT. PUBLIC RECORDS OFFICE, JAIPUR - DAY 51

          An office out of a Kafka novel; cloth bags containing files
          are piled all around the room, floor to ceiling.
          Graham is seated at a desk, in front of a sober official.
          He is filling in a form.

          EVELYN (V.0.)
          Those who know the country of old

          51A EXT. JANTAR MANTAR OBSERVATORY. JAIPUR - DAY 51A

          Norman seems less interested in the astonishing geometric
          devices of the ancient observatory than in the female
          tourists who have come to see them...

          52 EXT. STREET, CENTRAL JAIPUR - DAY 52

          The chaos and din of the street is even more mind-boggling.
          Madge now has the bonnet up, and is studying the engine.
          Douglas stands in the street, staring in wonderment around
          him.
          Inside the car, Jean looks utterly traumatized, shrinking
          lower in her seat as a horde of kids swarm at the windows,
          shouting, wheedling, gesticulating. Sonny does his best to
          wave them away.

          EVELYN (V.0.)
          ... for the heat, the motion, the

          53 INT. UPPER COURTYARD, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 53

          The guests look on with trepidation, as another meal is
          laid before them.

          EVELYN (V.0.)
          with the flow of exotic
          dishes he demands daily from the

          Baghara Baingan. Banjari Gosht.
          Paneer Methi Chaman ...
          As the list unfolds, the guests, one by one, enter their

          Until Norman.

          Mutton Vindaloo ...

          more intently.

          54 INT. HOSPITAL, JAIPUR - DAY 54

          reception area is a forest of dark skin. Muriel is rigid
          with fear.

          Initially you're overwhelmed.
          But gradually you realise: it's
          like a wave. Resist, and you'll

          Sonny is in discussion with some doctors.
          Then he turns to see that Muriel has vanished. Through the
          window Muriel can be seen frantically wheeling herself away
          down the path...

          Madge is exchanging some coins with a street trader in
          return for a mobile phone.
          In her room, Madge scans a phone directory, and dials a
          number.

          Evelyn is finishing her blog. She picks up the paper,

          58 EXT. STREET, JAIPUR - DAY 58

          Evelyn is walking down a rough street on the outskirts of
          the city. Kids are everywhere, laughing, shouting, doing
          tricks, begging.
          Evelyn approaches them, holding up a piece of paper.

          Evelyn's piece of paper gets passed around: none of the
          kids can read. An older boy finally points. Suddenly
          there's lots of pointing.

                         EVELYN (CONT'D)
          Thank you.
          She goes to move, but the kids are still all around her.

          I'm sorry, I don't . I don't

                         EVELYN (CONT'D)
          Alright? Alright now? Goodbye.
          She starts to walk, is surprised that the entire posse of
          kids walks with her. In fact, the group seems to be
          growing exponentially. She looks like the Pied Piper.

          Douglas is getting ready to go out. Jean clearly isn't.

          The road is absolutely rammed; with cars, bikes and
          rickshaws. All honking horns, all seemingly headed in
          different directions.
          Evelyn has somehow made it to the central reservation. She
          takes a deep breath, and plunges into the maze of traffic,
          heading for the other side.

          61 EXT. RICKSHAW. SUBURBAN ROAD, JAIPUR - DAY 61

          Graham is in a rickshaw. The rickshaw driver, PRAVESH, is
          driving it through a neighborhood in transition. Skeletal
          structures of a new India rise above the houses.

          Some kids playing cricket.
          The rickshaw weaves its way through them and comes to a
          halt.
          Graham gets out, and stands in the street, dwarfed by a
          huge modern building, some months away from completion.

                         GRAHAM
          This can't be right, surely?

                         PRAVESH
          I am thinking so, saab.

                         GRAHAM
          But there were houses all along
          here . these were homes.

          place..?

          No. That'll do for now. Thank
          you.
          He hands over some money, and Pravesh pedals away.
          Graham turns to look at the boys playing cricket. One of
          them, SANJAY, is batting.

          Don't grip so tightly with your
          right hand.

          Evelyn is still searching for the right address. She's
          turned off the main road, and is heading down a narrow side
          streets. The city has become denser, and the walls seem to

          Uncertain, Evelyn turns down a narrow alley, and suddenly
          finds herself in an enclosed courtyard strewn with
          makeshift washing lines. The atmosphere is faintly
          threatening.
          As she tries to find her way out, she becomes aware that
          she is being watched: the walls are full of doorways, and
          people have come out to stare at her. She has stumbled
          into their home.
          Evelyn tries to suppress her panic, turning from one face
          to another.

                         EVELYN
          I'm so sorry. I didn't realise -
          She backs into a kind of flatbed trolley, piled high with
          cooking utensils, which clatter noisily to the ground. She
          goes to pick them up.

                         EVELYN (CONT'D)
          Oh, I'm dreadfully sorry...
          A man is staring at her: SURESH.

                         SURESH
          Yes.

                         EVELYN (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry, I'm just trying to get
          to this address.

          Yes.

                         EVELYN
          Do you understand me? Can you
          help me find this place?

                         SURESH
          Yes.

                         EVELYN

          yes you can help me?

                         SURESH
          Yes.
          Some of the children who have gathered laugh at this, and
          the tension is broken slightly.

                         EVELYN

          63B EXT. STREET. JAIPUR - DAY 63B

          Suresh's flatbed trike is rolling down the street, piled
          impossibly high with bundles of brightly-coloured textiles.
          On the back, enthroned in the fabric, is Evelyn.

          64 EXT. WASTELAND - DAY 64

          Graham is playing cricket with the teenagers. He's good,
          too. He whacks a ball off into the distance.

                         GRAHAM

                         (TRIUMPHANT)

          YES!
          A boy runs off to fetch the ball. Graham half-runs, half-
          walks to the other end, then turns for a second run,
          breathing heavily. Then walks back to the crease, gets
          ready for the next delivery.
          It's hot and he's tired, but he hasn't felt this good for
          years.

                         SANJAY
          Give me the ball. I can take
          him.
          He turns cheerily to Graham.

                         SANJAY (CONT'D)
          Down is where you're going,
          Uncle.

                         GRAHAM
          Come on. Do your worst.
          They're both enjoying the banter, as Sanjay heads back to
          the beginning of his run-up, then turns and sprints in to
          bowl.
          As Graham watches Sanjay running towards him, Sanjay seems
          to slow, his movements becoming sluggish, never seeming to
          reach the crease. He looks at the faces of the other boys,
          frozen, waiting. The ball seems to take forever to leave
          Sanjay's hand.
          Graham steps back, completely fails to play a stroke, and
          is bowled.

                         SANJAY
          That's what I'm talking about! I
          felt the need, the need for -
          Graham still hasn't moved.

                         SANJAY (CONT'D)

          Graham finds his voice at last.

          Suresh brakes, stops outside a glass-clad high-rise
          building.

                         SURESH

          place is immaculate, controlled and efficient.

          I saw your advertisement in the
          local paper, and it specifically
          mentioned the ability to talk to
          older people. But this is not
          what I imagined ...

                         JAY
          You came for a job?

          there, then trying to calculate
          the exact moment just before it
          dissolves to whip it up to the

          Good evening, Your Honour.

                         GRAHAM
          Mrs Ainslie. I hope you had a
          good day. What did you get up
          to?

                         JEAN
          Well, I started in my bedroom,
          where I had a lovely couple of
          hours giving all the cockroaches
          names. Then after a lunch that
          will long have a place in my
          heartburn, I came out here
          and stared blindly at a book
          waiting for someone - anyone to
          rescue me. And how glad I am it
          was you.

                         GRAHAM
          Why would you not go out?
          There's so much to see.
          Jean had hoped for some appreciation of her wit, and is
          floored by his question. She can hardly understand, let
          alone tell him, the depths of her discomfort.

                         GRAHAM (CONT'D)
          Open your eyes, Mrs Ainslie. All
          life is here, I tell you.
          Jean stares at him. He goes on through the archway into
          the hotel. Then stops.

                         GRAHAM (CONT'D)
          I could talk to the chef, if you
          like. Perhaps get you some
          grilled chicken, plain rice.

                         JEAN
          I would appreciate that very
          much.

          come back out again.

          her room.
          A young hotel worker, ANOKHI, brings out a tray of food to
          her.
          Muriel watches her, but Anokhi is deferential, won't meet
          Muriel's eyes. She puts the tray down and leaves.
          Muriel just sits there, glaring balefully into the night,
          the untouched tray of food by her side.

          I'd rather hear about yours.

                         EVELYN
          I got a job. My first. Ever.
          I'm going to be a sort of
          cultural advisor.

                         GRAHAM
          A role I'm sure you'll perform
          with great distinction.
          He's about to inquire further, when Evelyn sees Douglas and
          Jean emerge from their room.

                         EVELYN
          Perhaps if you wouldn't mind
          keeping that news to yourself.

                         GRAHAM
          I'm flattered you shared it with
          me.
          He turns to greet the new arrivals.

                         (TO GRAHAM)
          I went to the temple you told me
          about. A place of meditation and
          peace, quite stunning.

                         JEAN
          So spiritual, I bet you hardly
          noticed the smell of elephant
          dung.

          No elephants, sadly. Still none.

          Yes, where do you get to every
          day?

                         GRAHAM
          Well, I've just finished telling
          Mrs Greenslade all about it.
          Evelyn registers the lie, but says nothing.

                         JEAN
          I'm sure she wouldn't mind
          hearing it again.
          She waits. But Graham is as elusive as he is tactful.

                         GRAHAM
          I talked to the chef for you. He
          said it will be no problem.

                         JEAN
          Did you hear that, Douglas?
          Plain grilled food; manna from

          Graham and Evelyn emerge through the arch heading for their

          Moments later. Evelyn is sitting in front of Graham's
          collage.

                         GRAHAM
          I grew up here. Just a short
          drive away. It was a big house,
          and we had servants, everyone
          did. We knew their wives, their
          children. One boy, Manoj, became
          my friend. We played a lot of
          cricket together, played anything
          we could. And that's how it
          stayed for years. Until one
          night, he became something more.

                         (BEAT)
          We had a few months, we had that.
          There was a weekend in Udaipur,
          we sat by a lake and watched the
          sun go down, and I remember
          thinking . I will never be this
          happy again. And I was right.
          Because quite suddenly it was
          over. We'd fallen asleep, and
          they found us.

                         (BEAT)
          For me it was bad enough. But I
          already knew who I was, and I
          think my family had guessed. For
          Manoj, the disgrace was absolute;
          a double taboo. His father was
          fired, they were sent away, all
          of them. I don't know what I
          could've done, but it should've
          been more than nothing. I put up
          no fight. I let it happen.

                         (BEAT)
          Soon afterwards I went to
          England, to University. I always
          told myself I'd come back. But I
          never did.

          Evelyn stands outside her room, listening to the bells,
          sipping a cup of tea, pensive. She looks down into a
          dilapidated part of the building, where the staff are
          housed. Women in bright saris go about their business.

          untouched supper tray with breakfast. Anokhi is about to
          leave, but stops.
          Then she goes to fetch Muriel's jar of pickle from the
          windowsill, and places it on the table.
          Muriel watches, then wheels herself outside, looks at the
          tray.

          As I will make mine. I have a
          dream, Mummyji. A most brilliant
          one: to out-source old age. And
          not just for the British. There
          are many other countries where
          they don't like old people too.

                         MRS KAPOOR
          Your brothers own a third of the
          hotel each, they are entitled to
          a third of the profits.

          Success does not happen
          overnight, Mummyji. This is blue

          long-term strategy and patience.

          than practice. Good day.
          He leaves. A moment later, Jean comes rushing out.
          Immediately she realises two things; first, that Graham has
          already gone. And second, that Muriel is watching her.

          81 EXT. VICEROY CLUB - DAY 81

          A classic colonial building, straight out of the English
          Raj.
          Madge is being shown around by an elderly secretary, MR

          DHARUNA.

                         MR DRARUNA
          The Viceroy Club was opened by
          the great Lord Kitchener himself,
          and many of the fixtures have
          remained unchanged since then.

                         MADGE
          Yes, I see that. Perhaps you
          could tell me a little about the
          clientele? Any maharajahs?
          Wealthy widowed land-owners?

                         MR DHARUNA
          It is not the policy of this club
          to divulge details of our
          members.
          They go past a very handsome older Indian man. Who
          radiates wealth and privilege.

          Where do I sign up?

                         MR DHARUNA
          The admission fee is 120,000
          rupees, and thereafter 15,000
          rupees each month.

                         MADGE
          I wonder if I might get a little
          discount. Owing to my status.

                         MR DHARUNA
          Your status, madam?

                         MADGE
          Yes. One was rather hoping to
          fly under the radar, but one is a
          member of the Royal Family.

                         MR DHARUNA
          Which member, madam?

                         MADGE
          I'm Princess Margaret.

          It is most surely an honour to
          meet you. And may I say how well
          you look. Especially taking into
          account that you died nine years
          ago.

          actually accelerate our

          None of the operators are on the phone. Instead they are
          sitting in a semi-circle, looking curiously at Evelyn. Who
          is sitting next to Jay, a little daunted by the attention.

                         EVELYN
          .You ring in the morning.
          Let's assume the person answering
          will be a woman. She will have
          had her breakfast. Tea or
          coffee. Semi-skimmed milk,
          always. If she's under 50 she'll
          be contemplating yet another
          diet, over 50 she'll have more or
          less given up, and be eating
          toast. The radio may be playing,
          or more likely daytime TV. A
          chat show, or a programme with a
          moderator speaking to a panel of
          young women whose boyfriends have
          all slept with their mothers.
          The girlfriends' mothers, I mean,
          not their own. Although
          Anyway, then the boyfriends
          usually come out, and everybody
          fights.

          rings and it's this robot
          nobody wants a machine, but it's
          almost worse when it's a person
          behaving like one. All these
          sales cliches just strung
          together. 'Your call is

          Madge walks up the gravel path towards the magnificent
          building. She's superbly dressed, looks great. She goes
          up to the BARMAN.

          This way, madam.
          He leads her along across the terrace. Madge follows,
          checking her hair, her breath, etc.
          The barman reaches an ornate suite of furniture. There's
          someone sitting there, his back to us, an elegant arm
          draped over the side of the chair.

                         BARMAN (CONT'D)
          His Royal Highness Prince Michael

          The man rises from his chair and turns. And Madge is left
          staring at Norman.
          There's a pause. Then Madge reaches into the barman's
          breast pocket, and removes her money.

          I'll have that back, thank you

          A huge construction, centuries old, with a series of steps

          Give me a minute. Then join us.
          She gets up, heads towards the bar. Where she sits a
          couple of seats away from the woman. Who is called CAROL.
          She sits there a moment, then sighs, and starts to talk to
          the barman.

                         MADGE (CONT'D)
          Rejected again. Many years ago,
          that man over there gave me the
          most extraordinary night of my
          life. He may seem coarse and
          uncouth, but that only disguises
          a tenderness and an exquisite
          sensitivity to a woman's needs
          Norman arrives at the bar.

          Yes, Carol. What brings you to
          Jaipur?

                         CAROL
          I run a small boutique travel
          agency. But I've actually lived
          here all my life. My father
          worked in the Foreign Office.
          Another silence.

                         NORMAN
          You're very fit.

          I mean you look like you keep
          yourself in shape. Physically.

                         CAROL
          Well, I did join a gym last year.
          It cost a fortune, and I didn't
          get any fitter. Apparently you
          have to actually go.
          Madge laughs. Norman doesn't. Then realizes that it was a
          joke, lets out a too-loud bray of laughter.

                         CAROL (CONT'D)

          I have to splash some water on my
          face. Please God I drown in it.
          She heads for the bathroom.
          Norman and Carol share another silence.

          Well look, it's been lovely
          chatting.

          Can we drop all this pretence?
          And start again? I'm not
          charming. I'm not good at

          plutocrat with the sexual
          capacity of a rutting rhino. My

          Day 22. Like Darwin's finches,
          we are slowly adapting to our
          environment. And when one does
          adapt, my god, the riches that

          Madge looks across the bar. And is startled to see Norman
          and Carol chatting up a storm, laughing together.
          As she watches, Norman orders more drinks, then turns
          smiling back to his new friend.
          Madge walks slowly out of the bar, and into the night.

          Because I hope for a different
          answer. Because I think you'll
          be hurt if I don't. And because
          it's not healthy for you to spend
          all day and every day in the
          confines of the hotel.

          Jean sits for a while, looking utterly disconsolate and
          lost. Then she gets up, goes over to the balcony.
          Down below she can see Graham leaving.

          Yes. The thing is, you see, I
          did actually want to buy that.
          To brighten up my room.

          They push through the crowds.

          97 INT. MARIGOLD HOTEL, DOUGLAS AND JEAN'S ROOM - DAY 97

          Jean gives up on the sentence she has already read a
          hundred times, and snaps her book shut. She stands, then
          sits again.
          Then stands.

          98 EXT. SWEEPER COLONY - DAY 98

          Ajit is now pushing Muriel through a poverty-stricken slum.
          The people live on the streets, or in collapsing tin
          shacks. Everywhere there is struggle and deprivation.
          And yet the pervasive atmosphere is nowhere near as
          depressing as we would expect. The colours are bright, the
          smiles on the children's faces even brighter.
          Not that Muriel can recognise the joy, of course. She's
          horrified by her surroundings. And acutely aware of the
          stares of the slum-dwellers.

          A primitive brick and cement hut, one of the few amongst

          A bunch of young kids are fascinated by Muriel's
          wheelchair, pushing it around and taking turns to sit on
          it.

          Muriel sits on the only chair.
          Opposite - squashed together as if posing for a photograph -
          are all the generations of Anokhi's family: Anokhi herself,
          her husband, mother, grandmother, and several children.
          They all smile at Muriel.
          A long pause. Then Muriel turns to Ajit.

          100 INT/EXT. HARDWARE SHOP - DAY 100

          Douglas is talking to JAMSHED, who works behind the
          counter. Evelyn sits outside.

                         DOUGLAS
          You see what I think, and of
          course I'm no expert, is that the
          valve seat has eroded, so we'll
          need the washer changed and a new
          seat re-ground.
          Douglas glances back at Evelyn. Who betrays not the
          slightest scepticism.
          Jamshed studies the tap.

                         JAMSHED
          The gland nut has come away from
          the spindle.

                         DOUGLAS
          Well of course, it could be that
          too. Can you fix it?

                         JAMSHED
          Not cheaply. Not cheaply. Most
          expensively indeed.
          Jamshed takes the tap to a workstation at the back, starts
          to fiddle with it. Douglas joins Evelyn.

                         DOUGLAS
          I was in a tuk-tuk the other day,
          didn't seem to be taking the
          usual route back to the hotel.
          It turned out that the driver had
          decided to take me to another
          hotel, that he was sure I would
          prefer. And of course one wants
          to believe that he genuinely had
          my welfare at heart, and that it
          wasn't run bg his brother-in-law.

          The day I met my husband was the
          day the fair came to town. My
          girlfriend and I went on the
          carousel. Her horse was fine.
          But when the ride began I felt
          mine give a little, like it might
          collapse. Then these strong arms
          were around me, holding the horse
          together. And a voice in my ear
          said "Just trust me". And I did.
          Without question. Until the day
          he died.

          She stops, looks fearfully at the chaotic sea of humanity
          outside. She's unable to move.
          Finally, she steps out. And is of course immediately
          assaulted by the assorted kids, beggars, street vendors,
          etc.
          As anxiety begins to engulf her, she quickens her pace,
          brushing through them as best she can, until she is almost
          running.

          Muriel looks up. They're all still watching, waiting

          She looks at Anokhi's grandmother, as dignified as she is

          Sonny is in his office, going through the accounts.
          There's a strange ringing somewhere nearby. He pays no
          attention, then stops and thinks for a moment. Then
          realises what it is.
          He sweeps the pile of papers off the desk, starts
          frantically looking for the telephone.

          as much as I can, but I feel I've
          hardly scratched the surface. And
          of course I'd love to see
          Udaipur. The lake you talked

          Muriel is sitting outside her room, doing the crossword.
          Madge is coming through the arch, stops dead.
          Norman is standing in front of her, on his way out. He

          street.

          It's a false alarm. There's no
          way they could find anything in
          that office. They probably just
          picked an address at random, just
          to keep me off their backs. I'm
          sure that's what happened. It's

          Across the street, Graham approaches a house. At a polite
          distance, Evelyn and Douglas wait. Graham knocks at the
          open door.
          A woman, GAURIKA, appears. She stares at Graham.

                         GRAHAM

          He breaks off. She's walked past him, looking to the other
          side of the road.
          He turns to look at the men playing cards. Gaurika calls in
          Hindi.
          A beautiful-looking man looks up. MANOJ.
          He looks across at the house. Stands up slowly as Graham
          walks across the street towards him.
          Graham reaches him. The two men just stand there for a
          moment. Then they hug very tightly.
          From the steps of the house, Gaurika watches.
          Evelyn looks at her, fascinated.
          Across the street, Manoj and Graham are still holding each
          other, unable to let go.

          Evelyn laughs. Then Douglas suddenly grabs her. And pulls
          her out of the way of a motor bike, zooming past them.
          Sunaina hasn't realised she nearly hit them, and powers on
          towards the Marigold.
          Douglas and Evelyn stand for a moment, startled, holding
          each other. Something passes between them that embarrasses
          them both. Then they part quickly, guiltily.
          They're outside a small restaurant, and with exquisite
          timing, a group of musicians start to play a romantic tune.

          The same street. The sun is just coming up, and traders are
          setting up their stalls, spreading their wares on rugs on
          the ground.
          One trader is unloading some fruit. A few guava roll off
          the edge of his wagon.
          Someone picks them up for him. It's Graham, who smiles as
          he puts them back. The trader gives him a fresh one.
          Graham takes it, and walks on, munching the delicious
          fruit. A contented man.

          Graham is watching a stunningly beautiful bird. A snow
          crane; white and magnificent. It's on the grass in front
          of him.
          Then it opens its huge wings, takes off. And flies up into
          the bright blue sky. It's an extraordinary sight.
          As Graham watches the snow crane swoop and dip, it appears
          suddenly to slow and stall, until it seems to hang in the
          air, almost motionless.

          A ruined garden, surrounded by the waters of the lake,

          overgrown.
          Graham's friends stand watching the pyre, transfixed by the

          by sunset, there must be nothing
          left but ash.

          Where do our souls go? is that

          that when we do shuffle off, we
          do so knowing that we were loved
          Manoj pours Graham onto the water. The ashes shim r and
          dance, caught in the gentle currents.

          Development of the Best Exotic
          Marigold Hotel can begin with
          immediate effect.
          Mr Maruthi looks down, sees Muriel. She's with Anokhi,

          Our journey here was arranged and
          paid for by the hotel, and look
          how that went. I'd rather walk
          back to England.

          And for myself the news is even
          better. I shall be moving to
          Delhi to live with my mother, and
          furthermore I shall be wed to a
          most suitable person of her
          choice, whom I look forward very
          much to meeting before I spend
          the rest of my life with her.

                         EVELYN
          But what about your girlfriend?

                         SONNY
          She is no longer my girlfriend.

                         EVELYN
          This is a disaster.

                         SONNY
          Then we must treat it just the
          same as we would treat a triumph,
          is that not what your Mr Kipling
          tells us? Although of course,
          here we have a problem. Because
          I, Sunil Indrajit Kapoor, have
          never had a triumph, so of course
          I do not know how to treat one.
          No, all I have had is an constant
          series of disasters interspersed
          with the occasional catastrophe,

          It is because I love her that I
          must not tell her. She can do so
          much better than me.

                         EVELYN
          And you have told her that?

                         SONNY
          Many times.

                         EVELYN
          Good. Women love it when you say
          that kind of thing. It's a
          powerful aphrodisiac.

                         SONNY
          Really?

                         EVELYN
          No, of course not. Go and find
          her right now, before you lose
          her forever. Her future is hers
          to choose, and so is yours. You
          can have anything you want,
          Sonny. You just need to stop
          waiting for someone to tell you
          you deserve it. Or you can just
          keep failing yourself, and
          hurting the ones you love -

          Muriel sits alone in the courtyard, under her awning.
          Then Carol and Norman appear from reception, followed by
          Mrs Kapoor. They cross towards the arch.

          If anything, the traffic is now worse. Jean and Douglas's
          taxi has progressed a few yards, and is now wedged into the
          arch. The Ganeshi procession is completely blocking the far
          entrance to the archway.
          Jean gets out, looks at the sea of unmoving traffic ahead
          and behind.

          She gestures for her wheelchair.
          Sonny rushes up with it. She sinks down.

          Douglas, still holding his suitcase, is surrounded by
          Ganeshi drummers, silhouetted against the lights of the
          city.
          The sound fades as he disappears into the celebration, and
          is replaced by the gentle sound of temple bells, ringing
          for morning prayers.

          We came here, and we tried. All

          Evelyn is still sitting, fully dressed in her room. She's

          Her alarm clock buzzes. She turns it off.

          I had quite an interesting night,
          actually. I met the same taxi
          driver, but this time I let him
          take me to his brother's hotel.
          Which turned out to be less of a
          hotel, and more of a brothel,
          really. They gave me this pipe,
          said it was apple tobacco, but
          that's not what we called it when
          I was a student. So I made my
          excuses and left, wanted some
          time to think. This city at
          night is extraordinary.

          Of course the apple tobacco
          helped.
