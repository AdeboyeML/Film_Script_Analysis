	EXT. COLUMBUS, OHIO - DAY

	The state capital of Ohio.  It's an impressive building for 
	a city this size.

	SUPERTITLE: COLUMBUS, OHIO - STATE CAPITAL

	INT. OHIO STATE SUPREME COURT - DAY

	In chambers striving for august, JUSTICES listen to a lawyer 
	MR. RODMAN, argue his case before the highest court in Ohio.  
	Mr. Rodman enjoys the sound of his own voice.

				MR. RODMAN
		This informant, paid by the police, 
		using taxpayers dollars to continue 
		his felony drug habit, was the link 
		which allowed police to raid a private 
		farm.  A working farm.  A farm where 
		honest Americans make their living.

	One particular justice, ROBERT WAKEFIELD, younger than the 
	others, is clearly bemused by this performance.

				MR. RODMAN
		The government, in its haste, has 
		employed an army of criminals whose 
		allegiance to the truth is, at
		best, questionable --

	Judge Wakefield interrupts --

				ROBERT
		Mr. Rodman...it's too bad your client 
		didn't show as much sense in choosing 
		what he planted as he did in choosing 
		his attorney...

	A polite chuckle from the justices --

				ROBERT
		Lately the only variation I'm hearing 
		in your argument is the name of the 
		client.  And you can sit there all 
		day arguing the ins and outs of 
		Illinois v. Gates, but you aren't 
		going to convince me that this country 
		has not sanctioned the use of 
		anonymous informants.
			(beat)
		Furthermore, there is no sacred 
		protection of property rights in the 
		United Sates.  When you make the 
		decision to have marijuana on your 
		farm, whether it's one joint or an 
		acre of plants, your property can be 
		seized and your property can be sold.

				MR. RODMAN
		I'm sorry the court finds my argument 
		repetitious.

				ROBERT
		Mr. Rodman, may I offer a piece of 
		advice?  The next time you argue 
		this point before this court, 
		regardless of my whereabouts, I 
		recommend you have something up your 
		sleeve other than your arm.

	INT. ROBERT'S CHAMBERS - DAY

	The office is marble and dark wood.  A young CLERK, black, 
	29, enters carrying an oddly-shaped gift.  They both look at 
	it.

				CLERK
		What do you think it is?

				ROBERT
		Depends who it's from.

				CLERK
			(reading the card)
		Your friends at Warren, Putnam and 
		Hudson.

				ROBERT
		You can learn a lot about somebody 
		from this stuff.  Three categories: 
		you like me, you hate me, you want 
		something from me.
			(re: the elaborate 
			box)
		Definitely third category.

				CLERK
		What would a law firm want from the 
		new drug Czar?

				ROBERT
		Depends on the state.

				CLERK
			(checks)
		Arizona.

				ROBERT
		Medicinal marijuana initiative.
			(beat)
		Or am I being cynical?

	They both laugh.  Robert reaches up and pulls a bottle of 
	Scotch from a shelf.  He pours a couple of fingers in two 
	glasses.

				CLERK
		Maybe there's a book in it.

	The clerk takes one of the glasses.

				ROBERT
		Not by me.

	They toast and drink.

	EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

	Robert exits, trailed by a small group of reporters.  He 
	gets into a car being driven by two security TYPES.

	INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

	Robert sits in a business class window seat.

	INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	An expensive hotel.  Robert Wakefield stands at the window, 
	looking at the view of our nation's capital.

	SUPERTITLE: WASHINGTON D.C.

	ON THE TABLE

	The remnants of a meal.  It was a steak and a small caesar 
	salad.  The wine glass is half-empty.

	ANOTHER ANGLE ON ROBERT

	In front of the mirror now, trying on a dark, tasteful jacket.

	CLOSER

	On Robert in the same position, only now we are in HIS HOME.  
	It's daytime, and his wife BARBARA is helping him into this 
	same jacket.  As her hands dust the lint off his shoulders

					WE MATCH CUT TO:

	ROBERT

	In the hotel rooms, making the same motions.  Satisfied, he 
	straightens, then turns to look at himself.

	OMITTED

	ANGLE ON ROBERT

	Back at the hotel room window now.  Reaches to the table and 
	lifts the wine glass.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY

	This is the middle of nowhere.  Scrub cactus and dust and a 
	heartless sun.

	SUPERTITLE: MEXICO - TWENTY MILES SOUTHWEST OF TIJUANA.

	A broken down-looking Police Sedan is parked on the side of 
	the road.  It seems abandoned except there are TWO MEN inside.

	INT. POLICE SEDAN - DAY

	Two Mexican men, State Police officers, JAVIER RODRIGUEZ, 
	30's, and MANUEL "MANOLO" SANCHEZ, 20's, wearing jeans, knock-
	off Polo shirts, and cowboy boots, wait patiently in the 
	car.

				JAVIER
		I had that dream again.

	A long pause.

				MANOLO
		Which one?

	Another long pause.

				JAVIER
		Where my mother's suffocating.

	They continue to wait until there is the sound of a JET 
	ENGINE.  It grows LOUDER as it approaches.

	EXT. THE POLICE SEDAN - DAY

	The shadow of a large plane crosses the desert floor.  Then, 
	an old DC-3 flies fifty feet above the Police Sedan.

	INT. POLICE SEDAN - DAY

	They watch the plane disappear over a small rise in the 
	desert.  They look at each other and wait some more.

	EXT. MEXICAN DESERT - LATER

	From the direction of the landing strip, a moving van lumbers 
	down the road, two TEENAGERS in the cab.

	INT. POLICE SEDAN - DAY

	Javi and Manolo watch the moving van approach.  Javi reaches 
	under the seat and picks up a bubble flasher.  He rolls down 
	the window and plants it on the roof.  He flips the switch.

	Nothing happens.  He jiggles the wire and the siren BURPS 
	and the light flashes.  Manolo and Javi step from the car, 
	smiling.

	EXT. MEXICAN DESERT - DAY

	The moving van slows to a stop.  Javi approaches.  The DRIVER 
	unhurriedly rolls down the window.

				DRIVER
		Is there a problem?

				JAVIER
		No.  There's no problem.

	The driver hesitates a confused beat then reaches for his 
	wallet.

				DRIVER
		Okay.  I see.  How much do you want?

	The driver pulls a wad of bills.  Javi shakes his head.

				DRIVER
		You want more than this?

	Javi shakes his head.  The driver exchanges a look with his 
	partner.

				DRIVER
		You want something else?

	Javi smiles.  The driver gets out and walks to the back of 
	the truck.  He opens the rear door.  There are neatly-stacked 
	crates marked with a SCORPION logo and "911."  He reaches 
	into one of them and pulls out a tightly-sealed package also 
	with the scorpion stamped on it.  He turns to see Javi with 
	his gun drawn.

	Manolo, at the passenger side, has also drawn his gun and is 
	motioning the partner to move to the back of the truck.

				JAVIER
		Drop the package.  Put your hands 
		behind your head.  You're under 
		arrest.

	The driver hesitates.  He starts to comply then looks at 
	Javi and Manolo.

				DRIVER
		I don't understand.  I think there 
		must be some mistake.

				JAVIER
		No, there's no mistake.

	Javi motions to Manolo who cuffs both teenagers.  The driver 
	begins spewing OBSCENITIES under his breath.  Javi puts the 
	driver in the front of the Shadow.  Manolo follows in the 
	moving van.

	OMITTED

	OMITTED

	EXT. DIRT ROAD - MEXICO - LATER

	The truck follows the Shadow down a desert road.

	Suddenly, from behind, four armored SUV's with tinted windows 
	appear, closing fast.

	The SUV's force both vehicles off the road where they pull 
	to a stop.  A long beat as hot wind blows desert detritus 
	past the truck.

	Finally, the SUV doors open and FEDERAL POLICE OFFICERS 
	surround them like a SWAT team.

	The passenger door of the lead SUV opens and GENERAL ARTURO 
	SALAZAR, 50's, a squat, powerful presence in a perfectly 
	pressed uniform gets out and approaches Javi.

				SALAZAR
			(to Javier)
		What's your name?

				JAVIER
		Javier Rodriguez.

				SALAZAR
		Well, Javier Rodriguez, you've done 
		a very good job, but we'll take care 
		of it from here.

	Javier stares into the implacable reflection of his 
	sunglasses.  In the distance, the DC-3 takes off and ROARS 
	over their heads.

				SALAZAR
		We've been following these Narco-
		trafficantes for some time but had 
		not been able to bring them to 
		justice.
			(to his men)
		Put the prisoners in the car.
		Impound the truck.

	The men follow Salazar's orders.

				SALAZAR
			(to Javi)
		One question.  How did you find about 
		this?

				JAVIER
		An informant.

				SALAZAR
		What is the name of your informant?

				JAVIER
			(beat)
		It was an anonymous tip.

	Salazar looks at Javi a beat.

				SALAZAR
			(to his men)
		For a State Police officer, you're 
		very well informed.  Let's go.

				MOMENTS LATER
		Javi and Manolo watch the convoy of 
		vehicles drive away.

	Javier lights a cigarette.

				MANOLO
		Wasn't that General Salazar?

				JAVIER
		Yeah.

				MANOLO
		What's he doing up here?

				JAVIER
		I don't know.  Something.

	They start for their car.

	EXT. DEL MAR SELF-STORAGE - DAY

	SUPERTITLE: SAN DIEGO

	Two men, RAY CASTRO, 30's, proud, ambitious, and MONTEL 
	GORDON, 40's, suspicious of everyone including himself and 
	always, always the smartest guy in the room, walk from a 
	Lincoln Towncar toward a dumpy office.  Castro is talking 
	under his breath --

				CASTRO
		No telltales.  Nothing to read.
		Not touching my face.  Not even 
		blinking.  No giveaways.
			(beat)
		How're you feeling?

				GORDON
			(keyed up)
		I feel good.

				CASTRO
		No more pissant basin league bullshit 
		for us, hunh?

				GORDON
		Nope.

	Castro stretches his arms, swings them around.

				CASTRO
		Limbering up, gonna stay loose, keep 
		it all together.  Take this 
		motherfucker down.

	They reach the door to the office.  Gordon looks at Castro, 
	then turns the handle.

				CASTRO
		Showtime.

	INT. OFFICE, DEL MAR SELF-STORAGE - DAY

	It's a cluttered, rundown working office unusual only in the 
	extent of its ordinariness.  A SECRETARY goes about her 
	business like a somnambulist.  CLERKS shuffle and file.

	Castro switches into Spanish --

				CASTRO
			(in Spanish)
		Good afternoon, ladies, gentlemen.  
		We're looking for Eduardo Ruiz.  We 
		have a two o'clock appointment.

	INT. OFFICE, DEL MAR SELF-STORAGE - LATER

	In a back alcove, Castro and Gordon sit across a cheap table 
	from EDUARDO RUIZ, 40's, an entrepreneur in an expensive 
	suit and bad hairpiece.  They are waiting.

				RUIZ
		You ever buy a quarter ton?  Not 
		many people have.

	Another "businessman" enters from another door and whispers 
	in Ruiz's ear, then leaves again.

				RUIZ
		So, it's worth the wait, right?
		What can I do?  Rent a Huey?  Have 
		an airlift?  It's not like you can 
		put it in a condom up some mule's 
		asshole, right?  How many peasants 
		would that take?  A line stretching 
		from here to Mexico City --

				GORDON
		Nobody said shit, Eduardo --

	One of Ruiz's hands dips under the desk where we see a handgun 
	is holstered on the underside.

				RUIZ
		Relax.  We're waiting, that's it.

				CASTRO
		Hey, you want to hear a joke?  I got 
		a joke.  Why do women wear makeup 
		and perfume?

				GORDON
		Chill out --

				CASTRO
		It's a funny fuckin' joke and it's 
		quick.  Why do women wear makeup and 
		perfume?

				RUIZ
		I don't know.

				CASTRO
		'Cause they're ugly and they stink.

	Castro laughs uproariously.

	INT. DEA SURVEILLANCE SPACE - DAY

	ON FUZZY SURVEILLANCE VIDEO: Castro laughing.  Ruiz politely 
	smiling, one of his hands hidden by the table.

				GORDON
		Man, you never been close enough to 
		a woman to know how she smells.

				DEA AGENT (V.O.)
		What's his hand doing?  Watch his 
		hand.  Anybody?  I don't like the 
		hand.

	IN THE OFFICE

	The room is filled with crappy surveillance equipment.  DEA 
	AGENTS, in DEA logo'd outerwear, jiggle a monitor fuzzily 
	displaying the view from another hidden camera: Gordon and 
	Ruiz around the cheap table.

				DEA AGENT
		This is ridiculous this fucking thing.
			(taps monitor)
		Look at this shit -- the first 
		television transmission.  I had better 
		shit when I was the AV guy at junior 
		high, swear-to-God.

				ANOTHER DEA AGENT
		Come on, Castro, pay attention.
		Watch his damn hands.

	ON THE MONITOR

	Another "businessman" enters the office and whispers in Ruiz's 
	ear.

				RUIZ (ON MONITOR)
		Soon.

	Another AGENT peers out a window through binoculars.

	HIS POV: THE EXTERIOR OF THE OFFICE WHERE CASTRO, GORDON, 
	AND RUIZ TALK.

	EXT. DEL MAR SELF-STORAGE, SAN DIEGO - DAY

	A BLUE VAN makes a slow turn into the parking lot.

	EXT. ROOF - DAY

	TWO FBI AGENTS, in jackets reading "FBI," hide on an opposing 
	roof.  They look through high-powered binoculars.  Binocular

	POV: THE BLUE VAN TURNING INTO THE PLAZA.

				FBI AGENT #2
		All right, here we go.  The blue 
		van.

	HIS BINOCULAR POV DETECTS THREE UNMARKED CARS DISCREETLY 
	FOLLOWING THE VAN.

				FBI AGENT #2
		Three unmarked vehicles.
			(picks up walkie)
		Three unmarked vehicles accompanying.

	The unmarked cars split up and one turns into the parking 
	lot of a fast-food restaurant.  The other circles around the 
	back of a building.

				FBI AGENT #2
		It's local.  Local or Customs.  Oh, 
		man, I don't know.  Looks like the 
		cavalry.

				FBI AGENT
		This is our show.  Ah, man.  I don't 
		want to share this one.

	INT. OFFICE, DEL MAR SELF-STORAGE - CONTINUOUS

	Through the window Ruiz, Gordon and Castro watch the van 
	disappear into the bay of a storage unit.  A man is pulling 
	down the door behind it when three unmarked squad cars ROAR 
	into the lot, surrounding the unit, officers exit the cars 
	with their guns drawn -- Gordon and Castro stare in disbelief.

	Ruiz FIRES the gun under the desk which hits Gordon full in 
	the chest, knocking him backwards.

	Ruiz's men run into the room pulling guns.

	Castro dives and pulls his weapon, firing at Ruiz's men, 
	hitting both of them.  Ruiz bolts through another door.  
	Castro pursues, talking into his shirt collar --

				CASTRO
		Agent down.  Repeat, agent down.

	Gordon gets slowly to his feet, shaking off the blast to his 
	Kevlar, and runs after them.

	EXT. DEL MAR SELF-STORAGE - DAY

	The DEA are shooting at the men inside the storage unit who 
	are shooting back.

	From all over the stake-out location, DEA AGENTS emerge firing 
	their weapons.  An equal number of FBI AGENTS emerge firing 
	in return.  Nobody was aware of the other's presence.

	It's CHAOS, a clusterfuck of law-enforcement zeal with three 
	competing sets of good guys shouting through BULL-HORNS, 
	GUNSHOTS and SCREAMING.

	Ruiz breaks through the corner of the lot, cutting between 
	two buildings.  Castro emerges and chases him.

	EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

	Ruiz runs out the back of the storage company.  He cuts 
	between parked cars, heading for The Fun Zone, a kiddie 
	restaurant.

	INT. THE FUN ZONE - DAY

	Castro enters The Fun Zone.  There's a cardboard cutout of 
	SPASTIC JACK, a beloved comedy figure who looks like a rabbit 
	version of Jar Jar Binks, promoting the "Special Edition" 
	glass: "Collect All Four."  There's an enclosure filled with 
	colored plastic balls.

	The restaurant is empty except for a CLOWN filling out a 
	time card.  The clown stands.

				CLOWN
		Hey dudes, we're not open yet.

	Castro makes a motion for him to be quiet and keeps moving 
	toward the room of colored balls.

	Gordon enters the restaurant and follows him.  An ANIMATRONIC 
	BAND starts to play a SONG.

	Gordon sees a half-hidden foot buried underneath the plastic 
	balls at the far end of the room.

	He takes careful aim and FIRES.

	Ruiz SCREAMS and sits up.  Castro pounces on him, disarming 
	him, and roughing him up.

	EXT. THE FUN ZONE - DAY

	Castro and Gordon shove Ruiz into the sunlight.  They wait 
	while their eyes adjust.

				RUIZ
		Take me to the hospital.  I'm bleeding 
		to death.

	Castro shoves him forward.

	ACROSS THE PARKING LOT

	DEA has opened the back of the van where a quarter-ton of 
	cocaine is spilling out onto the pavement.

							CUT TO:

	INT. GUEST HOUSE - AFTERNOON

	A bong hit is expelled into the air.  In the living room of 
	a comfortable, preppy guest house, private school TEENAGERS 
	party and hang-out: cigarettes in ashtrays, beer and bong on 
	the coffee table, loud MUSIC.

	SUPERTITLE: CINCINNATI, OHIO

	The TV is on with the sound off.  The curtains are closed.

	The four boys wear school blazers with their ties pulled 
	askew, the three girls' clothing are also identical.  Some 
	sit on couches, some on the floor.  They are stoned.

	One intense-looking boy, SETH ABRAHAMS, 17, wild curly hair 
	and the attitude of a young Coleridge, and a girl, CAROLINE 
	WAKEFIELD, 16, really sixteen which means she looks about 
	12, pretty and flirtatiously irreverent, sit at a desk in 
	front of a Powerbook G-3 playing an on-line trivia game.

	Seth speaks rapidly and precisely.

				SETH
		Father of Greek tragedy?  Anyone?
		Okay, Aeschylus it is.
			(hits keys)
		His trilogy?  The Oresteia.  I mean 
		this is beautiful, can anyone stop 
		the Seth Machine?
			(hits keys)
		Score.  Thank you.  Madmax from Omaha 
		we own you.  And Tragedy is closed 
		out.

	Seth leans over and snorts a line of coke from a mirror.  He 
	hands it to Caroline who effortlessly does one.

				CAROLINE
		Entertainment.  The Susan Lucci 
		section or Banal Love Songs of the 
		Nineties?

	Seth looks at her.  He has a crush.

				SETH
		Banal Love Songs it is.
			(hits keys)
		Hey, you wanna try something?

	She nods.  They both take a swig of beer.  He takes her hand 
	pulling her past the stoned people on the couch --

	IN THE KITCHEN

	Seth takes out a box of baking soda.  He tears off a square 
	of aluminum foil.  He takes out a spoon.  Caroline watches 
	as he dumps a small amount of cocaine into the spoon.  He 
	adds a pinch of baking soda.  He puts in a few drops of water.  
	Stirs it around with the heel of a lighter.  Then holds the 
	flame under the spoon.

				CAROLINE
		What are you doing?

				SETH
			(concentrating)
		Just watch.

	He watches the substance in the spoon as it swirls and 
	bubbles, then separates... He pours the most viscous part 
	onto the aluminum foil, making four separate little puddles.

	He quickly dismantles a ballpoint pen, making a straw.  He 
	hands it to Caroline.

				SETH
		Inhale the smoke and hold it.

				CAROLINE
		What is this, like freebase?

				SETH
		Not like.  It is.

	He lights the flame under the aluminum foil.  The puddle 
	crackles and pops, then starts to smoke --

				SETH
		Go...  Go!

	There's a rush of thick grey smoke.  Caroline catches most 
	of it.

				SETH
		Hold it.

	She pulls it in deeper and holds... Suddenly her expression 
	changes... Her eyes lose their focus, her face slackens, an 
	almost sexual response.  Seth is watching her intensely.

				SETH
		See... Now, you see.

	Caroline slumps back against the counter.  Seth moves against 
	her, kissing her, running his hands over her breasts and 
	body.  She stares over his shoulder, holding it as long as 
	she can.

	Finally she exhales --

				CAROLINE
		More.

	The cloud of grey smoke from her lungs fills the room.

							CUT TO:

	INT. WHITE HOUSE OFFICE - DAY

	The White House CHIEF OF STAFF meets with Robert Wakefield.  
	The Chief of Staff has the floor; he always has the floor.

	This is a man you do not want to disappoint.

				CHIEF OF STAFF
		Until you officially take over the 
		office of National Drug Control 
		Policy, under no circumstances should 
		you speak to the press unprotected, 
		without going through this office or 
		having someone in the room.  There 
		are a lot of interests in this town 
		and, right now, they're all scared 
		of you.  The reason they're scared 
		of you...technically, you have veto 
		power over their budgets.  So think 
		about that: FBI, CIA, DEA, CUSTOMS, 
		TREASURY, ATF, DEFENSE, IRS, Radio 
		Shack and the DMV, they're all gonna 
		want to speak to you.  And that's 
		the good news... You'll also be 
		meeting Senators and Congressman, 
		each with a specially prepared 
		question.  Their question is designed 
		for one thing: to make them look 
		smart.  If you lecture them, they 
		won't think you respect them.  If 
		you respond with utter humility, 
		they will.  Remember, this is about 
		your respect for them, and the 
		President's respect for them.  
		Speaking of which, as soon as he 
		gets back from Russia and China, 
		we'll get you in there for some face-
		time, let the two of you catch up.
			(beat)
		It'd probably be a good idea for you 
		to meet your predecessor.  I'll have 
		Jeff Sheridan take you over.
		Also, four weeks from today you will 
		give your first official press 
		conference.  In it you will outline 
		the President's strategy for winning 
		the war on drugs.
			(beat)
		Okay, anything else?

				ROBERT
		I'll be sure to let you know.

	INT. EXECUTIVE BUILDING, WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY

	Robert makes his way through a warren of hallways in the 
	endless corridors of the Old Executive Building alongside 
	JEFF SHERIDAN, 35, an enthusiastic government employee who 
	has found his place.

				SHERIDAN
		I just want to be clear about one 
		thing.  I used to work for him, but 
		now I work for you.  I'm not a 
		partisan person, I'm an issue person.  
		In the next few weeks, if you allow 
		me, we'll get you well-versed on an 
		incredible array of issues.  The 
		most important of which, in my 
		opinion, being Mexico.  I know 
		everybody that you're gonna meet.
		It's important that they like you.
		It's not important that they like 
		me.  That's why I can help protect 
		you.

				ROBERT
		Like you protected Landry?

				SHERIDAN
		I see where you're going with that, 
		but if I could just say something, 
		which is basically that a guy like 
		Landry is so autocratic he doesn't 
		know how to let himself be helped; 
		it's a point of pride to take every 
		bullet, no matter who fired it, or 
		whether it was even aimed at him, 
		which personally I think it very 
		self-defeating.  Now, don't get me 
		wrong, he's a man of enormous 
		integrity, but there's a political 
		component to this job that the General 
		just didn't have any patience for.

	INT. OFFICE OF NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL POLICY - DAY

	Robert and Sheridan enter the office of outgoing Drug Czar, 
	GENERAL RALPH LANDRY, 60's, buzz-cut, professional soldier 
	with a sense of humor.

	Landry is putting some personal items in a box.

				GENERAL LANDRY
		Jeff, you want to excuse us for a 
		minute?

	Sheridan nods and leaves.

				GENERAL LANDRY
			(bemused, off 
			Sheridan's exit)
		Functionaries.  Nice people, the 
		Schedule C's.  About twelve graduate 
		degrees apiece, but it seems sometimes 
		all they do is start rumors.

	Robert and Landry shake hands.

				ROBERT
		You've done a fine job here, Sir.
		The Office of National Drug Control 
		Policy is in better shape than when 
		you found it.

	Landry tries to determine whether Robert believes this.  He 
	looks around the office as if the policy is hiding somewhere.

				GENERAL LANDRY
		I'm not sure I made the slightest 
		difference.
			(wistful)
		I tried...  I really did.

				ROBERT
		There are a lot of encouraging 
		statistics.  The work's just started, 
		but I intend to see it through.  
		You've got my word on that.

				GENERAL LANDRY
		You're here for two years, three 
		maximum.  What'd they promise you?
		Court appointment?  What?  District?
		Appeals?
			(checks Robert's 
			reaction)
		Not Supreme... Supreme?

				ROBERT
		I've come in to do a tough job and 
		that's what I'm going to focus on.

	General Landry SIGHS.

				GENERAL LANDRY
		When Kruschev was forced out, he sat 
		down and wrote two letters and handed 
		them to his successor.  He said "When 
		you get into a situation you can't 
		get out of, open the first letter 
		and you'll be saved.  And when you 
		get into another situation you can't 
		get out of, open the second."  Soon 
		enough this guy found himself in a 
		tight place.  So he opened the first 
		letter.  It said, "Blame everything 
		on me."  So he blamed the old guy 
		and it worked like a charm.
			(beat)
		He got into another situation he 
		couldn't get out of, so he opened 
		the second letter, which read, "Sit 
		down and write two letters."

	They stare at each other a beat.  Then Landry smiles.

	EXT. MANOLO'S STREET, MEXICO - DAY

	A cinderblock house.  Kids and dogs in the street.  A face 
	we recognize as Manolo's peers out of a curtain into the 
	street.

	INT. MANOLO'S KITCHEN - DAY

	The ceiling is stained, the floor sags.  A cheap radio plays.  
	Manolo is at the door.  Javi sits at a dinette table.

	He talks to Manolo but watches Manolo's wife, ANNA, 20's, a 
	nice-looking, ostensibly demure young woman, as she moves 
	around the kitchen.

				JAVIER
		Relax.  If they were going to kill 
		us they would have done it in the 
		desert.

				MANOLO
		They wouldn't do it in front of all 
		these people.  They'd send someone 
		later, when we're alone.

	Manolo tenses, and throws open the window.

				MANOLO
			(yelling out the window)
		Away from the car.  Now!

	MANOLO'S POV out the window as KIDS play in the car, sitting 
	behind the wheel.

				JAVIER
		Even if that were true, they're not 
		going to come to your house where 
		you're waiting for them.

				ANNA
		He's right.  They'll do it when you're 
		walking somewhere, make it look like 
		street crime.

				MANOLO
		Shut your fucking mouth.  Nobody's 
		talking to you.

	Anna sets a cup of coffee in front of Javi and stares at 
	him.

	INT. POLICE SEDAN - DAY

	Javi and Manolo cruise through the streets of Tijuana.

				JAVIER
		If you want her to stay out of it, 
		then stop telling her everything.
		You should learn how to keep a secret.

				MANOLO
		She's nosy.  She hears me on the 
		telephone.

				JAVIER
		Anyway, I don't think we'll ever see 
		them again.  Everything's back to 
		normal.

	EXT. TIJUANA STREET - DAY

	Tourist hell.  A cacophony of street venders, panhandlers, 
	and vehicular traffic.  Javier and Manolo are speaking with 
	a flustered young American TOURIST COUPLE.

				TOURIST WOMAN
		You're a police officer.  Aren't you 
		going to take a report or something?  
		Don't you want to know what kind of 
		car it is?

				TOURIST MAN
		It's a Brown Ford Explorer --

				TOURIST WOMAN
		It was right here.  It's been stolen.  
		I want to file a report.

				MANOLO
		Please.  Filing a report will not 
		help you find your car.

				JAVIER
		The police won't find your car.

				TOURIST WOMAN
		But you're the police.

	Javier pulls out a note pad and scribbles a number.

				JAVIER
		Call this man, he'll find your car 
		for you.

				TOURIST MAN
		I don't get it --

				TOURIST WOMAN
		How will this guy know who has our 
		car?

				JAVIER
		The police will tell him.

	There's a beat of confusion.

				TOURIST MAN
		Why will they tell him but they won't 
		tell us?

				TOURIST WOMAN
			(getting it)
		Because we pay him, stupid.
			(to Javier)
		Right?  And he pays the police.

	And then our car appears.

				JAVIER
		Yes.  Better than filling out forms, 
		right?

	The man reaches in his wallet and offers Javier a twenty.  
	Javi waves him off.

	Javier and Manolo walk back to their squad car when two SUV's 
	come to a stop in front of them.

	Javier and Manolo exchange a look.  The doors SLAM and 
	FOOTSTEPS approach.

	EXT. LA JOLLA GOLF AND TENNIS CLUB - DAY

	A ladies luncheon in the Nancy Reagan Dining Room overlooking 
	a putting green.  The bejewelled WIVES of successful men 
	yammer at one another around tables with rich flower 
	centerpieces.

	SUPERTITLE: LA JOLLA, CALIFORNIA, JUST OUTSIDE SAN DIEGO

	One wife, HELENA AYALA, 32, ex-model, with a sweetness and 
	intelligence that almost contradicts her beauty, stares out 
	the window at a small BOY, 5, using a putter as tall as he 
	is.  Helena is six months pregnant and radiant.

	A waiter brings Helena's starter course.  Her friends, NAN 
	DOBBS, early 40's, post Junior League, a little tipsy,

	STEWIE and ALEX, same League, watch her --

				NAN
		Duck salad?

				HELENA
		Mmm.

	Nan can't believe it.

				NAN
		Helena, you never order duck salad.

				HELENA
		Well, that's true.  I don't.
			(re: her belly)
		I think someone else is asking for 
		it.

				NAN
		Well, he's got good taste.  Isn't it 
		the most wonderful thing you ever 
		tasted?  I mean ever.

				HELENA
		It's delicious --

				STEWIE
		They're the most marvelous little 
		creatures.  Canard.  They fly, swim, 
		walk.  And so cute with their babies 
		marching along behind.

				NAN
		Looking for a nice sauce ala orange.

	Everyone laughs.  Helena is by far the youngest in her crowd.

				ALEX
		It's a very fatty bird.  All that 
		winter insulation.  Just like me.

				NAN
		You mean all breast, just like you.

				ALEX
		You're bad --

				NAN
			(singsong)
		Jealous, that's all --

				HELENA
		I've heard... I can't remember 
		where... That it's full of that good 
		kind of fat, the kind you're
		supposed to eat --

				STEWIE
		Unsaturated fat --

				TWO WOMEN IN UNISON
		Polyunsaturated.

				HELENA
		And now there's a good cholesterol 
		and bad cholesterol.  Everything 
		they tell you completely changes 
		every other week.  I don't know why 
		they think we should listen at all.

				NAN
		What I know is ducks, as cute as 
		they are, were designed by God to be 
		eaten.

	Nan reaches for a taste and the other women lean forward 
	also, a sea of inanity swirling around Helena's salad.

	EXT. COUNTRY CLUB PARKING LOT - DAY

	Helena buckles her little boy, DAVID, 5, into the front seat 
	of her Mercedes.  He won't let go of his putter.

				HELENA
		I'll put this in the back.

				DAVID
		No --

				HELENA
		All the professionals keep them in 
		the trunk.

				DAVID
		Not Tiger Woods.

				HELENA
		Especially Tiger Woods.
			(sharing a secret)
		...Actually, he keeps his on the 
		back seat.

	She pulls the putter away from the reluctant boy and sets it 
	on the back seat.

	EXT. HOTEL - DAY

	A modern high-rise on the waterfront playground of San Diego.

	Helena passes the hotel in her car.

	INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

	A standard room looking out at the water which is dotted 
	with sailboats and cruise ships.  The bed is covered with hi-
	tech surveillance equipment.

	The equipment salesman, LONNIE, 40's, who makes a fetish of 
	gadgetry, explains the finer points of operation to FRANCISCO 
	"FRANKIE" FLORES, 30's, sallow, watery-eyed, in expensive 
	clothes.

				LONNIE
		Gates, Myrhvold, Bezos.  I sell to 
		all those guys.  Why?  Because the 
		technology to intrude has reached 
		the masses.  Your competitor, your 
		ex-spouse, adversaries, stalkers, 
		they're at the local electronics 
		store right now, and they're gonna 
		be intruding on you not only through 
		your telephone, but your fax, cell 
		phone, pager, cable TV, Musak, 
		windows, walls, air conditioning 
		ventilation, modem, and internet 
		connection.

	He walks over to the bed and the sexy equipment --

				LONNIE
		Nobody has these babies, no way, not 
		the shiznit.

	Frederico picks up a piece of equipment.

				FRANCISCO
		I want to intercept cell phone calls, 
		digital and analog.  And locate the 
		source of the call.  I need databasing 
		capability, to cross-reference calls 
		and numbers.

	Lonnie lovingly picks up a laptop computer with a sleek device 
	attached to it --

				LONNIE
		Your Cellular Secretary, friend across 
		all the digital wireless spread 
		spectrum.
			(beat)
		So, Francisco, what do you do?  You 
		a PI?  Private security?

	Francisco looks at Lonnie coldly.

				FRANCISCO
		Assassin.

				LONNIE
			(not missing a beat)
		Assassin, okay.  Let's get you started 
		in surveillance.

	EXT. GEORGETOWN BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

	The house takes up most of one of the nicest blocks.  PEOPLE 
	enter and party VOICES drift out.

	SUPERTITLE: GEORGETOWN, WASHINGTON, D.C.

	INT. GEORGETOWN BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

	A power cocktail party in full swing.  This is where most of 
	the business in Washington gets done.

	Robert, scotch in hand, listens to a smug PHARMACEUTICAL 
	LOBBYIST explain the world.

				PHARMACEUTICAL LOBBYIST
		We in the legal drug business, and I 
		mean Merck, Pfizer, the rest of my 
		very powerful clients, realize this 
		isn't a war with a traditional winner 
		and loser, but an organism at war 
		with itself, whose weapons of mass 
		destruction happen to be intoxicants.  
		And if you want a body count look no 
		further than alcohol which racks up 
		80,000 kills a year.  Cocaine manages 
		a measly 2,000.  Same for Heroin.  
		But, the big daddy is Big Tobacco 
		which kills 380,000 each year, which, 
		by the way, is more people than have 
		been killed by all the illegal drugs 
		in the last century.

				ROBERT
			(faking it)
		That's very interesting.

	The lobbyist smiles.  Robert sips his drink.

	ANOTHER ANGLE ON ROBERT

	In another room.  Listening to STAN, overweight advocate for 
	the United States Council of Chambers of Commerce.

				STAN
		It's time, Robert, to choke some 
		honesty out of these rural 
		legislators; get'em to fess up that 
		it's pretty much Prisons or Casinos 
		in terms of their choices for economic 
		growth.

	ANOTHER ANGLE ON ROBERT

	listening to ETHAN, earnest advocate of harm reduction.

				ETHAN
		What's the difference between Prozac 
		and Ecstacy, you ask?  One's a 
		mattress and the other's a trampoline.  
		Molecules don't have morality.  
		Really, think about it: some molecule 
		changes the way a serotonin re-uptake 
		inhibitor works, it's not suddenly a 
		bad molecule; it's just a molecule.  
		My theory: America has a real fear 
		of short, intense experiences.

	Robert turns away --

				ROBERT
			(under his breath)
		Like you.

				ANOTHER ROOM
		Robert at the bar getting another 
		scotch.  A secretive man, TIM, 40's, 
		nerdy, sidles up beside him and 
		whispers furtively in his ear.

				TIM
			(whispering)
		Chemicals?  Some say problems, others 
		say solution.  Imagine a cloud that 
		when it rains prohibits the growth 
		of poppies or takes the THC out of 
		marijuana.  Imagine a pill that 
		eliminates any psychological craving, 
		from Dilaudid to Dove Bars.  Law 
		enforcement hasn't let science sit 
		on the sidelines.  Addiction is no 
		more relevant than polio or the Black 
		Plague.

	Tim slips away into the crowd.  Robert moves away from the 
	bar.

	ANOTHER ROOM

	An argument is breaking out between an ECONOMIST and an 
	UNDERSECRETARY OF DEFENSE with Robert as the audience.

				ECONOMIST
			(to the undersecretary)
		You're not battling traffickers or 
		dealers, but a market, and the market 
		contains a paradox: if you arrest 
		traffickers, you raise prices, and 
		you also raise profits, which brings 
		more traffickers into the business.

				UNDERSECRETARY
			(to the Economist)
		Back in the real world, we're talking 
		about Mexico and not John Maynard 
		Keynes.  We will spend 18 billion 
		dollars this year on this "war," and 
		the question on the table every year 
		is do we certify Mexico as an ally 
		or not?

	Another man, RUSH PHILLIPS, a middle-aged powerbroker, 
	overhears, then joins and Robert is encircled.

				RUSH PHILLIPS
		You want to make a difference, hit 
		the users. You don't jeopardize our 
		financial markets by some hypocritical 
		stance on drug consumption.  We're 
		snorting it, why penalize Mexico for 
		supplying it?

				UNDERSECRETARY
		Mexico, don't talk to me about
		Mexico --

				ECONOMIST
		It's the stick of law enforcement 
		that creates the carrot of huge
		profits... That's economic truth --

				RUSH PHILLIPS
		Addicts don't vote; they don't have 
		PACs; they don't spend soft money,
		that's political truth --

				UNDERSECRETARY
		We're locking them up and
		consumption is falling --

				ECONOMIST
		The price of coke and heroin has 
		dropped and purity has increased.
		All this law enforcement has achieved 
		is kids can get better stuff, cheaper.  
		In economic terms, you can forget 
		it; this is not a winnable war.

				RUSH PHILLIPS
		Christ, you want to decertify 
		somebody, take Pakistan or Columbia.
		We don't need them for anything.

				ECONOMIST
		If you manage to seize an 
		inconceivable 50 percent of all drugs 
		coming into this country, you'll 
		still raise the price of coke and 
		heroin less than 3 percent which 
		won't affect drug use at all.

				RUSH PHILLIPS
		Why are we calling this a war at 
		all?  You don't declare war on your 
		own people.  Addiction is a little 
		worm that gnaws a house apart from 
		the inside.

	MICHAEL ADLER, about Robert's age, and as successful, but in 
	a different way, approaches, catching Robert's eye through 
	the arguing demagogues.

				UNDERSECRETARY
		We need Mexico for these reasons:
		number one -- Defense; two -- Trade; 
		three -- Tourism; then, way on down 
		the line, comes Drugs.  The President 
		knows this.  Why's he holding 
		everybody's feet to the fire?

				MICHAEL
			(solemn)
		Mr. Wakefield, there's a situation 
		that needs your attention right away.

	Robert looks at Michael, squints, looks closer, then follows.

				RUSH PHILLIPS
			(oblivious)
		One in sixteen Americans is of Mexican 
		descent.  Mexico our third largest 
		trading partner...

	ANGLE ON ROBERT AND MICHAEL ON THE BACK PORCH.

				ROBERT
		You're looking pretty good for an 
		old guy.

				MICHAEL
		My work keeps me young.

				ROBERT
		Which part, getting terrorists loose 
		on bail or freeing convicted murderers 
		on technicalities?

				MICHAEL
		The worst serial killer in history -
		who?  Gacy - right?  Killed forty 
		two people.  Our government killed 
		fifty thousand in Vietnam and lied 
		about it every day.

				ROBERT
		Michael, you represent drug dealers, 
		not civil libertarians.

				MICHAEL
		We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama.
		Is that covered in your Constitution?
		Because it isn't in mine.

				ROBERT
		Noriega is a criminal.

				MICHAEL
		Noriega was head of a sovereign nation 
		who made the mistake of doing business 
		with the U.S.  Government.  So, no, 
		I don't have a problem waking up 
		every day and fighting our government, 
		fighting people like you, trying to 
		keep this system a little bit honest.

				ROBERT
			(amused)
		Last I read your clients were chopping 
		people up with chainsaws and 
		delivering illegal narcotics into 
		this country.

				MICHAEL
		I hope when you were on the bench, 
		Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle 
		the presumption of innocence in the 
		same fashion.

				ROBERT
		If I ever return to the bench, 
		Counselor Adler, I hope I have the 
		pleasure of hearing your arguments.

	Workers set-up the party under the direction of a professional

	A BMW 740il with tinted windows pulls into the driveway.

				DAVID
		Daddy!

	The window lowers and we see CARL AYALA, 40's, handsome, 
	charismatic, second generation American, in expensive, 
	conservative clothes, covering his cell phone as he greets 
	his kids.

				CARL
		Hello.  Hello.

	He goes back to his phone call, pulling around to the garage.  
	David goes back to his game.

	INT. AYALA DINING ROOM - DAY

	There are MAIDS in the house and a COOK in the kitchen.  The 
	large rooms are filled with fine art.

	Helena Ayala sits at the dining room table with plans, bills

	the room, continuing his cell phone conversation.

				CARL
			(into phone)
		I'm sorry, Jonas.  I don't care if 
		that is the price you have gotten in 
		order countries.

	Helena watches her husband pace as he talks.  He can't help 
	it, but a portion of this call is theatrical, for an 
	audience's benefit, which in this instance happens to be his 
	wife.  Helena's expression of annoyance resets itself into 
	love.

				CARL
		This is America, a different country.  
		I am Carl, a different man.  So you 
		see, everything about our situation 
		is different and I believe the pricing 
		will be different, too.
			(beat, listens)
		You're a reasonable man... So take 
		the weekend to think about it.

	Carl clicks off the phone, turns to Helena.

				CARL
		Every day with this guy is like

				CARL
		Hi.

				HELENA
		Hi.

				CARL
		What's up?

				HELENA
		Just watching you.

				CARL
		I got that.  How was your day?

	She pushes the topiary away from her.  Suddenly, she seems 
	tired.  Carl comes over and puts his hand on her pregnant 
	belly.

				CARL
		You all right?

				HELENA
		I keep feeling like I'm forgetting 
		something.

	Her husband watches her, then wraps his arms around her.

	EXT. AYALA HOME - DAY

	Carl and Helena step out on the front porch of their home 
	and watch David play with his golf putter.

	OUTSIDE THEIR GATE

	An unmarked police car rolls up and stops behind the wall.  
	Another arrives and another and another.  OFFICERS in DEA 
	jackets exit the cars.

	There is MURMURING, then SILENCE.

	Helena slowly turns to look at her husband.  He doesn't look 
	at her.

				HELENA
		David, come inside --

	Suddenly, POLICE and DEA enter the front yard.  Gordon and 
	Castro enter the yard and move quickly up the drive to Carl.

				CARL
		What is this?  What is going on?

				GORDON
		Mr. Ayala?

				CARL
		That's right.

				GORDON
		You're under arrest for violation of 
		Federal Narcotics laws.

	Gordon and Castro spin him, cuff him, and without emotion 
	begin pulling him from his yard.  David is trying to get to 
	his father.  In a kind of shock.  Helena trails after him.

	Castro drags Carl into the street toward the open door of 
	the cruiser.  He pushes him down into the backseat.

				GORDON
		We have a warrant to search your 
		home, Mrs. Ayala.

	Gordon hits the side of the cruiser and it pulls away.  Carl 
	looks at his wife through the window.

	Gordon and Castro head up the driveway toward her house.

	Helena is left standing in the street.  NEIGHBORS, who have 
	appeared in front yards and at the ends of driveways, stare 
	at her with suspicion.  David approaches and holds onto her

		What if every country legalized at

				ROBERT
			(smiles)
		Somehow, I don't see that happening.

	INT. WAKEFIELD DINING ROOM - EVENING

	From the hallway we see Robert and Barbara and Caroline having 
	dinner.  A family tableau.  We hear Barbara talking, the 
	murmur of the days events.

	In the room, Barbara continues her dinner table thoughts.

	Robert has a good deal of reading material stacked on the 
	table.

				BARBARA
		So you know we put the case before 
		the arbitration panel, none of whom 
		had any expertise.  Superfund is 
		just one of those words.  People 
		stop paying attention.

				ROBERT
		That's frustrating.

				BARBARA
		It's so frustrating.

	There is wine on the table and Caroline is allowed a glass.

	Her parents watch her take a responsible sip.

				CAROLINE
			(to Robert)
		Did you meet the President?

				BARBARA
		Honey, your father knows the 
		President.

				ROBERT
		As it happens, the President of the 
		United States, my new boss, the leader 
		of the free world, has me penciled 
		in for some "face time".

				CAROLINE
		Will we get invited to the White 
		House?

				ROBERT
		I don't know.

				CAROLINE
		How long's the job?

				ROBERT
		It's a presidential appointment so... 
		until I quit or get fired.

				BARBARA
		Czar for life, just like a real czar.

				CAROLINE
		That makes mom the Czarina.  I'm a 
		Czarette.  Like Anastasia.

	Caroline thinks about this.

				CAROLINE
		None of my friends can fucking believe 
		my dad is the actual Drug Czar.

				BARBARA
		Caroline --

				CAROLINE
		Sorry, but I mean, come on.

	Robert doesn't know if she's putting him down.

				CAROLINE
		It's great, daddy.  It's just amazing, 
		that's all.

	They all look at each other.  Caroline sips her wine.

	INT. SAN DIEGO JAIL - DAY

	In the intake area of a busy San Diego precinct, Helena sits 
	on a bench and regroups.  Detectives move past her.  
	Handcuffed criminals are separated, bagged and tagged.

	beautifully dressed man, ARNIE METZGER, 30's, super- lawyer, 
	knows everyone from the top of the system to the bottom, 
	slick but likable, smart and ruthless, too, separates himself 
	from a DETECTIVE he's gladhanding and approaches Helena.

				ARNIE
		Helena, I'm so sorry --

				HELENA
		Arnie, thank God.

	Metzger sits, giving her a hug.

				HELENA
		Can you please tell me what on earth 
		is going on?

	Arnie looks at her as if to say, "do you really not know?"

	Then, he speaks quietly with his hand in front of his mouth.

				ARNIE
		I understand.  You're upset.  You 
		want to know what's going on.  That's 
		good.

				HELENA
		Why are you talking like that?

				ARNIE
		Listen to me carefully.  First of 
		all, Carl isn't here.  DEA's got him 
		and they'll hang on to him until 
		arraignment, which will probably be 
		tomorrow.  So here you're wasting 
		your time.  Are you with me?

	He checks to see if this is registering.

				ARNIE
		Good.  From now on I want you to 
		expect that every word you utter 
		will be tape-recorded, that the 
		movement of your lips is being read.
		Got it?

				HELENA
		Arnie, this is crazy.

	He makes eye contact with her.

				ARNIE
		Got it?
			(she slowly nods)
		Good.  Do not discuss anything over 
		the telephone.  Do not talk to the 
		neighbors.  Stay out of your yard.

				HELENA
		What is he being charged with?

				ARNIE
		I don't know, but under no 
		circumstances would I talk about it 
		here.  I want you to go home and 
		relax the best you can.  Continue 
		your life as if nothing has happened.
		That is very important.

				HELENA
		Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping 
		through the looking glass.

				ARNIE
		That's a very apt analogy, Helena.
		Now, go home and be with your 
		children.

	EXT. BUILDING PARKING LOT - DAY

	Helena exits.  Her expression is set as she drives.  She 
	turns a corner in the shopping district, passing JAVIER AND 
	MANOLO who are walking down the street.  Tourists, drunk 
	Marines and the homeless piss away another day.

	We follow them into a bar with blackened windows and a 
	discrete sign.

	INT. BAR - DAY

	This is a place where men come to meet men.  And it's already 
	lively even at this early hour.  Javier and Manolo find a 
	seat and wait.

				LATER
		Javi is working on his second beer 
		when he seems to recognize somebody.

	ACROSS THE ROOM

	Francisco "Frankie" Flowers has entered the bar.  Javi watches 
	him circulate through the room then settle at the bar.  Javier 
	finishes his beer, rises, and takes the empty seat next to 
	Francisco.  Manolo watches.

	Very quickly Javi strikes up a conversation.  We don't hear 
	what they're saying but it doesn't matter because Francisco 
	clearly likes Javi.

	Off Francisco's anticipatory smile --

	suburbia.  It is very late.

	INT. SOMEBODY'S PARENTS' MANSION - NIGHT

	Somebody's parents are out of town and the house feels empty.  
	Big empty rooms with expensive furniture nobody sits on.

	Faint MUSIC echoes through the house.

	INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

	High ceilings of a 1930's kitchen.  Vodka bottles and 
	cranberry juice and limes are spilled across a counter.  ON 
	THE RHODES AGAIN by Morcheeba plays from a jam-box on a 
	counter.

	Maybe ten TEENAGERS are partying hard in this kitchen.  It's 
	weird and disassociated, people wandering in and out, playing 
	with kitchen utensils, heavily fucked up.

	There are drugs on a mirror on the eat-in table.  Caroline 
	and Seth and two friends sit around this table.  VANESSA, 
	16, almost pretty, is hitting a freebase pipe and holds the 
	hit.  FUCKED-UP BOWMAN, 17, super-preppy with a wan, Baby 
	Huey face, takes a slug of vodka.

	They are jittery, sweaty, tweaked, fucked-up --

				CAROLINE
		All I'm saying, what I'm saying, is 
		it never seems like anybody ever 
		says anything that matters to them, 
		like we all look at each other and 
		nod with responses we've been trained 
		to make, not real responses, just 
		social conventions, phony, fake 
		smiles, surface bullshit... I mean, 
		we're all smart and do we have any 
		idea what each other are like, really 
		like?  Do I know what Seth's afraid 
		of, or Vanessa, or fucked-up Bowman?

	Everyone looks at Fucked-up Bowman who grinds his jaw 
	appreciatively --

				CAROLINE
		...Probably, but do I ever say this 
		stuff, just say, "hey, I'm 
		uncomfortable in this crowd, I don't 
		know what the fuck I'm doing, either?  
		I know you're afraid and it's okay--

	Seth's words come quickly, they're riffing, totally in sync, 
	totally wired --

				SETH
		We act like we have all the answers 
		and we're totally invincible like 
		our parents seem and their parents 
		before them and it's fucking bullshit --

	Fucked-up Bowman takes another slug of vodka and almost pukes.

				FUCKED-UP BOWMAN
		For instance --

				SETH
		For instance I know you jack-off 
		thinking about Caroline even though 
		you're supposedly "in love" with 
		Vanessa.  Whatever the fuck that 
		means?
			(a digression)
		I mean, what is that convention, 
		anyway?  We're all these random 
		collections of self-interest, and 
		then we just decide that now we're
		two people walking along --

	Caroline expels a hit of rock cocaine --

				CAROLINE
		And Vanessa doesn't think she's pretty 
		so she does all these weird fucking 
		diets which is totally about self-
		esteem.  And she's beautiful.
			(beat)
		And that's not even fair.  Because 
		listen to me.  I'm fucking lying 
		right now.  This is exactly what I'm 
		talking about... I'm supposedly 
		talking about you, making some big 
		point about you, and it's really 
		about me.  So I should talk about 
		me, not you, not even the universal 
		"you..."
			(takes a beat)
		Okay.  Okay, I'm worried I'm not 
		really smart or that I'm not nearly 
		as smart as people think I am, or 
		that my parents' expectations have 
		been way too high since I was five, 
		I mean who knows they're going to 
		Harvard when they're five, not that 
		I'm blaming them for anything because 
		everything's great, and I may not 
		even get in, but we all feel this 
		shit and we never acknowledge it and 
		if we can't acknowledge it to the 
		people we care the most about then 
		who will we ever say it too and what 
		kind of life will that be?

	They all look at each other with love.  This is an adventure 
	and they're having a connection --

				FUCKED-UP BOWMAN
		I jack-off thinking about Seth.
		Everybody I know does.

	Bowman does another huge hit of freebase.

				CAROLINE
			(disgusted)
		Ach, that's what I'm talking about.
		Sarcasm.  Always fucking sarcasm.
		You're afraid and you think if you 
		admit it people will think you're
		weak or won't like you --

				SETH
		We live our lives by these unspoken 
		rules that are handed to us.

	They all look at each other, vibrating with the moment --

				VANESSA
		Let's be different --

				FUCKED-UP BOWMAN
		I can't feel my hands.

	Bowman looks around, squinting, confused.  He's chalk white.

				FUCKED-UP BOWMAN
		I'm serious --

	Suddenly, he clutches his chest and begins to twitch.  Puke 
	and foam come from his mouth.  He seizes and falls from the 
	chair.  Vanessa SCREAMS.

	Seth and Caroline push the table aside to get a better look.  
	Other people in the kitchen slowly take notice.

				VANESSA
		He's blue.  He isn't breathing --

				CAROLINE
		Is he breathing?

	Bowman's eyes have rolled back in his head.

				SETH
		What do we do?  Okay.  Fucked-up 
		Bowman's turning blue.  Doctor.  We 
		need a doctor.

				VANESSA
		Your dad's a doctor.  Call him --

		He's a research doctor.  You're

		Mapping the fucking pig genome.

	talks to him calmly while dumping chili powder into a 
	container of soda water.

				TORTURER
		We know Tijuana Cartel gunmen killed 
		our chief of intelligence, Francisco.  
		We know you killed police commanders 
		in Tijuana and Mexico City.  Why do 
		you resist?

	He approaches Francisco and begins shaking up the soda water.  
	He rips the tape off his mouth.

				FRANCISCO
		My father is rich.  He'll pay you.

				TORTURER
		Not the correct answer, my friend.

	The torturer puts another strip of duct tape across 
	Francisco's mouth.

				TORTURER
		We know that you went after the 
		neighbor of General Salazar, a simple 
		alfalfa farmer.  His grand-daughter 
		was shot.  This is stupid behavior, 
		Francisco.

	Francisco starts to squirm and whimper.  The torturer closes 
	one of Francisco's nostrils and sprays the pepper-laced water 
	into the other nostril.

	It's like a bomb went off in Francisco's brain.  He SCREAMS 
	and passes out.  Blood and mucous oozes out of his nose.

		Of course he is.  I've known him for

	Helena is relieved, but she's not looking at Arnie and when 
	she does she sees him shaking his head in a very definitive, 
	"No."

	Arnie stands and continues talking as he walks to the windows 
	and shuts the blinds one by one.

		...Carl is a very important member 
		of this community and when we're

	The blinds are closed.  Arnie crosses to Helena and talks 
	very softly in her ear.  She's a beautiful woman and Arnie 
	manages to make this act seem both practical and 
	inappropriate.

		Okay, honey.  We understand.  You're

		Honey, we'd like to talk alone.

		Me, too.

				ROBERT
			(reaching a decision)
		We'll ground her, clip her wings a

				BARBARA
		Honey, this is difficult, but we've 
		all had our moments.  I tried --

				ROBERT
		Stop.  You experimented in college.
		I don't want to hear about that.

				BARBARA
		Should we take the quotes off 
		experiment and call it what it is?

				ROBERT
		This is different.

				BARBARA
		Why?

				ROBERT
		To begin with, she's only sixteen 
		years-old.

				BARBARA
		I think she has to find out for 
		herself, on her own.  We have to
		allow her space --

				ROBERT
		Space for what?  To O.D. like that 
		other kid?  I will not send the 
		message that this type of behavior 
		is okay with her parents.  Because 
		it isn't.  Correct?

				BARBARA
		We don't want to push her away.
		These are growing experiences.

	Robert looks at his wife, then it dawns on him.

				ROBERT
		How long have you known about this?

	No response.

				ROBERT
			(yelling)
		How long have you known?

				BARBARA
		Six months.  I found some marijuana, 
		that's all.  And a little pipe about 
		two inches long.  I talked with her.  
		She said her friends smoked pot and 
		drank --

				ROBERT
		Explain to me how you could think 
		that I shouldn't know about this.
		Explain to me how this wouldn't be 
		relevant to me.  As a parent.

				BARBARA
		She asked me not to.

	He leaves the room.

	Caroline is sitting in a rocking chair with headphones on.  
	She faces the window and moves back and forth, back and forth.

	Robert calls her name, but the SOUNDTRACK is drowning him 
	out.

	He calls again, this time apparently loud enough for her to 
	hear.  She takes the headphones off - the MUSIC stops - and 
	turns to look at him.  Or rather, she looks right through

	INT. CELL - MEXICAN MILITARY BASE - DAY

	It's pitch black in the cell.  There's a human in here, but 
	we can't see him.

	Suddenly the door is thrown open and light floods in, 
	illuminating a very broken Francisco Flores.

	The figure of Commander Salazar fills the doorway.

				SALAZAR
		This is shameful.  A disgrace.
		Francisco Flores --

	Francisco cowers in the corners --

				SALAZAR
		It's all right, son.  It's all right.  
		Salazar is here.  You're among 
		gentlemen, now.  This shameful 
		treatment will stop immediately.
			(calling out)
		Guard!

	A GUARD appears in the doorway.  Francisco is spooked.

				SALAZAR
		I want to know who is responsible 
		for this treatment.

				GUARD
		Yes, sir!

				SALAZAR
		We aren't barbarians.

				GUARD
		Yes, sir!

				SALAZAR
		Bring this man a change of good 
		clothes.  Has he eaten?

		I don't know, sir.

	A packed courthouse.  Carl is at the defense table.  He 
	doesn't look at Helena who sits in the gallery next to Arnie 
	Metzger.

	The PROSECUTOR is finishing his argument --

				PROSECUTOR
		This is a man who heads a large 
		criminal organization with 
		international contacts we can only 
		begin to understand.  Our case against 
		him is very strong.  He is not a 
		flight risk.  His flight is assured.  
		The people ask that your honor denies 
		bail.

	The prosecutor sits.  Carl's defense lawyer, MICHAEL ADLER, 
	from the Georgetown party, stands and speaks.

				ADLER
		My client is no more a flight risk 
		than your Honor or the able 
		prosecutor.  He is a pillar of his 
		community, a family man with a wife 
		and child in La Jolla, the community 
		where he has made his home for over 
		twenty years.  As our defense will 
		quickly show, my client is guilty of 
		nothing more than being a handy target 
		for an admitted criminal.  Therefore 
		we ask that you release Carl Ayala 
		on his own recognizance.

	Adler sits.  The JUDGE makes a quick decision.

				JUDGE
		I'm gonna deny bail.

	The judge SLAMS his gavel.  The crowd is on its feet.  Carl 
	tries to get a glimpse of Helena.  They make eye contact.  
	Reporters from the press gallery are yelling for Helena.

	Arnie ushers her away.

	EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

	Adler, Arnie, and Helena push through a crowd toward her 
	car.

	There are several reporters there who ask questions --

				REPORTER
		Mrs. Ayala, were you aware your 
		husband is the largest cocaine 
		smuggler in America?

				ADLER
		Alleged, people, alleged.

	Helena gets into her car and slams the door.  Adler faces 
	the reporters.

				REPORTER #2
		Mrs. Ayala is it true your husband 
		has ordered a hit on Eduardo Ruiz?

	Adler is in a role he relishes.  Helena drives away.  We 
	move up to Gordon, who is watching from the hotel window 
	across the street.  He speaks into a walkie-talkie, and a 
	car down below pulls out to follow Helena.

				ADLER
		Carl Ayala sits on the board of the 
		Children's Hospital.  He is heavily 
		involved with Adult Literacy.  He 
		has a small boy and another child on 
		the way.  If you spread this kind of 
		innuendo, you can expect legal

	Caroline sits on the toilet in her private bathroom.  She's 
	not going to the bathroom, it's a seat and she's wearing her 
	pajamas.  She's reading a magazine.  The exhaust fan is on.

	There are pictures of her and her friends on the walls: goofy 
	pictures from camp, from school, a collage she's made with 
	cutouts from magazine pictures and copy.

	On the sink next to her is a little square of well-charred 
	aluminum foil; she's done many hits.  She leans over and 
	picks up a small piece of crack cocaine from a small pile in 
	her soap dish.  She drops it on a clean place on the foil.  
	She picks up a lighter and the tube of a ball point pen she's 
	turned into a straw.

	She heats the bottom of the foil.  The crack "crackles."

	She chases the smoke across the foil.  A huge hit.  She leans 
	her head back, her eyes roll back, she tries to focus on the 
	magazine, on anything, she stares up at the ceiling.

	She holds it as long as she can then blows it toward the 
	exhaust fan.

	Caroline looks at her watch.  It's 7:20.  She stands suddenly, 
	unsteadily.  She looks at herself in the mirror.

	She's really high and indecisive.  She looks around wildly.

	She sees the shower.  She turns it on.  She drops her pajamas.

	She goes back to the foil and hits another piece of the rock, 
	taking another really big hit.  She crushes the foil and 
	flushes it down the toilet.  She hops in the shower.

	IN THE SHOWER

	The water streams over her face.  After a long beat she 
	finally exhales the smoke of the hit through the water and 
	steam.  She's in ecstacy.

	It's almost time to leave for school.

		of Ensenada, hydroponic raspberries.  
		He met up with the Obregon brothers 
		of the Tijuana Cartel who were 
		interested in two things: entering 
		society and using his fishing boats.

				GORDON
		So you pay off our customs officials?

				RUIZ
		In Mexico law enforcement is an 
		entrepreneurial activity, this is 
		not so true for the USA.
			(condescending)
		Using regression analysis we made a 
		study of the customs lanes at the 
		border and calculated the odds of a 
		search.  The odds are not high, and 
		we found variables that reduce the 
		odds.  We hire drivers with nothing 
		to lose.  Then we throw a lot of 
		product at the problem.  Some get 
		stopped.  Enough get through.  It's 
		not difficult.

				CASTRO
		You'd think he wasn't sitting here 
		facing life in prison.

				RUIZ
		This has worked for years and it 
		will continue to work for years.
		NAFTA makes everything more difficult 
		for you.  The border is disappearing.
			(pointing at them)
		You people are like those Japanese 
		soldiers left behind on deserted 
		islands who think that World War II 
		is still going on.
			(with total disdain)
		Let me be the first to  tell you, 
		your government surrendered this war 
		a long time ago.

				GORDON
			(to Castro)
		This attitude's not gonna help him 
		any, is it?

		I got greedy.  I decided to bring a

	EXT. TIJUANA - SAN DIEGO BORDER CROSSING - DAY

	Car after car, an unending multi-lane stream of vehicles 
	moving into the U.S.  Any of these cars could be carrying 
	drugs.

	INT. CUSTOMS CONTROL BOOTH - DAY

	On an elevated walkway, this booth commands a view of 
	everything.  Robert and Sheridan listen to an OFFICIAL give 
	the spiel.

				OFFICIAL
		The busiest land border crossing in 
		the world.  Over forty-one thousand 
		vehicles per day, twenty-two thousand 
		pedestrians on foot.  I think we do 
		a pretty good job but we know a lot 
		of drugs are still getting through.

				ROBERT
		Any idea how much?

				OFFICIAL
		I've read official estimates but I 
		wouldn't bet my house on them.  I've 
		heard the entire cocaine supply for 
		the United States can fit into four 
		tractor-trailers.
			(gestures to the 
			traffic)
		At least a half-dozen of those cars 
		right out there are carrying a load 
		of dope, with drivers employed by 
		people who don't give a damn if 
		they're caught or not.

				ROBERT
		What do you look for?

				OFFICIAL
		We ask questions and measure the 
		answers.  When something doesn't 
		ring true, a fact that doesn't make 
		sense, a slight hesitation, then 
		it's off to secondary for a closer 
		look.  Before NAFTA we had about 1.9 
		million trucks a year.  Now it's 
		almost double.  Pretty soon there'll 
		be Mexican truck companies that will 
		have as much freedom in crossing the 
		border as American truck companies.

				ROBERT
		Any way we can do it better?

				OFFICIAL
		Sure.  More money in intelligence on 
		their side of the border.  So we 
		have a better idea who we're looking 
		for.  More dogs.  More people.  
		Supposed to be getting some giant x-
		ray machines to run the trucks 
		through.  Outside of martial law 
		that's about the best you're gonna 
		do.
			(beat)
		But, I should tell you, there are 
		two things that really have us on 
		edge right now.
			(beat)
		In the last six months seizures have 
		tripled, even though we're pulling 
		over the same number of cars.  What 
		does that tell you?

				ROBERT
		That triple the amount of stuff is 
		going through.

				OFFICIAL
		Right.  But, that's not the biggest 
		problem.  One of our Intel officers 
		picked up information from DEA that 
		traffickers have come up with a 
		process, a chemical process, to turn 
		coke into something else.  It doesn't 
		smell like coke.  It doesn't look 
		like coke.  And what's worse, it 
		doesn't react to field test.  It 
		could be anything.  Maybe it's already 
		happening.  I mean, how would we 
		know?

	He checks out Caroline's body.

				SETH
		Caroline, give me your money.

	She hands over her money to Seth who pays and gets the drugs: 
	gram baggies of rock stamped with a scorpion and "911," and 
	wax-paper bindles of heroin, also labeled, "911."

	Caroline has been watching the transaction.  Sketch makes 
	slow eye contact with Caroline.  After a beat --

				SKETCH
		Goodbye... Caroline.

	Seth and Caroline make their way out of the building.

				SETH
			(under his breath)
		Yeah, right.

	EXT. BUILDING - DAY

	Seth and Caroline hold hands as they hurry down the steps.  
	The lookout speaks without moving his lips.

				STREET DEALER
		Now, get the fuck out of here.

	Caroline stops suddenly.  She pulls Seth to her and kisses 
	him hard.  There's no better moment than the one right after 
	scoring before you start using.

	EXT. VILLA ELAINE - DAY

	A flophouse of the seediest variety: wino in the doorway, 
	prostitute taking care of business, everyone fresh out of

	INT. VILLA ELAINE - DAY

	They approach the front desk which is behind six inches of 
	glass.

				SETH
		We'd like room 205.

				DESKMAN
		Then you hand me twenty-eight dollars.

	INT. ROOM 205 - VILLA ELAINE - DAY

	They enter and the light bulb goes out.  Seth fumbles his 
	way to the mini-fridge, which he opens, throwing feeble light 
	across the floor.

	They check out the decrepit room: the sloping mattress, the 
	black and white television bolted to the bureau.  The mini- 
	fridge.  Caroline bounces on the bed.  They are teenagers.

	Seth prepares the drugs by the light of the mini-fridge.

				SETH
		I love this place.

	Seth dumps the drugs on the bedside table.  From other pockets 
	he extracts aluminum foil, lighter, tube.  She trails away 
	watching him fix the first hit.

				SETH
		Did Courtney Love play Nancy in Syd 
		and Nancy?

				CAROLINE
		I think so.  If she didn't she should 
		have.
			(checks her watch)
		I've only got maybe an hour.  Then 
		volleyball practice is over and I 
		have to be home.

				SETH
		Why?  Nobody's there.

	He prepares the first hit.  She does it and lies back.  He 
	does one.

				CAROLINE
			(blowing out the hit)
		The maid... They ask her what time I 
		get back.  She spies for them.

	Seth starts kissing her.  They try to get into it, but both 
	of them are thinking about the drugs.

				CAROLINE
		I wish we could stay here.  Just be 
		here forever and ever.  Make it a 
		little home.

	She leans over to snort a tiny line of heroin.

				SETH
		I want to have sex and do a hit right 
		as we're coming.

	Caroline's distracted by the line she's snorting.  After a 
	while...

				CAROLINE
		Okay.

	Seth begins undoing her jeans.

				SPECIAL-AGENT-IN-CHARGE
		...Over 200 DEA field agents, a budget

	INT. EPIC BUNKER CAFETERIA - DAY

	A huge lunchroom.  Long plastic institutional tables and 
	agents minding their own business,

	Robert, Sheridan, and their Epic Guide walk through.  They 
	pass a wall of black and white head shots --

				ROBERT
		Who are these guys?

				SPECIAL-AGENT-IN-CHARGE
		Agents who died in the field.

	EXT. BINOCULAR POV - DAY

	of large mansion with manicured grounds.  The back lawn is 
	filled with children, balloons, a merry-go-round, and pony 
	rides.  It's a sumptuous children's birthday party.

				SPECIAL-AGENT-IN-CHARGE
		That house, that you see from the 
		DEA headquarters, belonged to Porfirio 
		Madrigal -- the Lord of the Skies, 
		largest trafficker in Mexico.

	ANGLE ON ROBERT

	looking through the binoculars.

				ROBERT
		He died in a liposuction surgery, 
		right?

				SPECIAL-AGENT-IN-CHARGE
		Right.  Now it's used by somebody 
		from the Juarez Cartel, one of his 
		lieutenants...  Who knows?
			(beat)
		Every damn day there's birthday party.  
		At first I thought they must have 
		three hundred children, then I 
		realized they're taunting us.  Three 
		miles away and we can't touch them.  
		Ha, ha, ha.

	BINOCULAR POV: a child running in circles holding a clutch 
	of colored balloons.

				ROBERT
		Who do we interface with on their 
		side?

				SPECIAL-AGENT-IN-CHARGE
		What do you mean?

				ROBERT
		I mean, who runs interdiction on the 
		Mexico side?

				SPECIAL-AGENT-IN-CHARGE
		I don't know.  I don't think there's 
		any one person.
			(thinks)
		See the problem is the Juarez cartel 
		owns everything and everybody, all 
		the property on the Mexican side, 
		sometimes all the property on both 
		sides.  Warehouses, transportation, 
		even tunnels.  It's very organized.

	EXT. TRAMAC - DAY

	Robert, walking with purpose, leads his group to their plane.

	INT. MILITARY JET - DAY

	Robert and Sheridan and several DEA, Law Enforcement, and 
	Military Officials.  It's a nice plane, used for important 
	people and Robert has the best seat.

				ROBERT
		I want everyone thinking out the box 
		for a second.  What are we gonna do 
		about Mexico?
			(silence)
		Come on, guys.  Out of the box.

	The men on the plane just stare at him.  Finally the REP 
	FROM DEA leans forward.

				REP FROM DEA
		Unlimited funds?

				ROBERT
		Unlimited.

				REP FROM DEA
		From a DEA standpoint we need a vetted 
		task force and matching funds.  And 
		cut the red tape on getting them 
		equipment and training.

	Robert turns to the others.

				ROBERT
		Come on.  I want to hear from 
		everyone: FBI.  Customs.  Treatment.
		Is there anyone from treatment on 
		this plane?
			(no one answers)
		Then I want an answer for why there 
		isn't anyone from treatment.
			(beat)
		Look, we know we have to bust one of 
		these cartels, Juarez or Tijuana, 
		not just as a symbol, but hell yes, 
		also as a symbol - they are symbols - 
		and there's nothing wrong with sending 
		a message.  That's why when Carlos 
		Ayala hired Michael Adler lead 
		defense, I flew Ben Williams to San 
		Diego to prosecute.  Because he's 
		the best we have, he's our symbol 
		that we're serious about putting the 
		top people away.
			(beat)
		So, as of right now, this flight 
		only, consider the dam on new ideas 
		thrown open.

	Still, no one else says anything.  They watch Robert 
	impassively.

				ROBERT
		If I'm not mistaken, we got DEA, 
		Pentagon, U.S. Attorneys office, 
		about a billion dollars of budget 
		right here.  So what are you people

	INT. ARNIE METZGER'S OFFICE - DAY

	Helena and Arnie enter his office.  The furniture is sleek 
	mid-century modern, and the view of the harbor is 
	extraordinary.

				ARNIE
		On a clear day you can see Mexico 
		City.

	Arnie stands very close to Helena and looks at her profile.

				ARNIE
		This place is swept twice a day.  I 
		learned that in Miami in '85.  Then 
		the U.S. shut down the whole 
		Caribbean, but it's a big game of 
		wack-a-mole.  Knock it down in Miami, 
		it pops up here.  And San Diego is 
		so much more relaxing.

				HELENA
		Arnie, I need money.  Somebody 
		threatened my children.  They want a 
		first payment of three million 
		dollars.

				ARNIE
		Helena, if I had it I would give it 
		to you, but I don't have that kind 
		of money.

				HELENA
		Arnie, help me.  Doesn't anyone owe 
		us money?

				ARNIE
		Yes, I told you before, there are 
		people who owe you money but they're 
		not paying.  There's too much heat 
		on Carl.

				HELENA
		Please.  Tell me who Carl sells to.

	Arnie thinks.

				ARNIE
		Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you.
		You do not want to come into contact 
		with these people.  Only Carl knows 
		who they are.  That's his real asset.  
		Ruiz doesn't know them.  They don't 
		know Ruiz.  Church and State.

				HELENA
		What about legitimate businesses?
		We own a construction concern, real
		estate --

				ARNIE
		Laundromats for the washing of money.  
		Unfortunately, Carl had only one 
		successful business.

				HELENA
		Don't you have some good news?  Isn't 
		there something positive you could 
		say.

	There isn't.  Helena looks Arnie in the eyes.

				HELENA
			(vulnerable)
		Sometimes I wonder what I'll do if 
		Carl doesn't get out.  I'm not very 
		adept at being on my own.  I've always 
		had a man in my life.  Always.

				ARNIE
		I remember when I first met you: 
		little Helen Watts from the wrong 
		side of somewhere.  I had a feeling 
		even then that your survival instincts 
		were pretty well honed.

				HELENA
		I'm glad you think so, but I'm 
		picturing a debt-ridden, thirty-two 
		year-old mother whose ex-husband is 
		being compared to Pablo Escobar.

	Javier and Manolo ride through a nice neighborhood in Mexico 
	City.  Javi isn't familiar with the roads and drives 
	cautiously.

	A young lady, ROSARIO, early 20's, sexy and vulnerable, rides 
	in the back of the SUV.

				ROSARIO
		You two don't like me, do you?

	Manolo laughs and looks her up and down.  Javi watches her 
	in the rearview mirror.

				JAVIER
		We don't have an opinion on you.

				ROSARIO
			(to Javi)
		Maybe it's because I'm getting an 
		apartment nicer than anything you'll 
		ever see in your life?

	Javi says nothing.

				ROSARIO
			(re: the neighborhood)
		I can't believe the old man kept his 
		promise.

				JAVIER
		The General is a man of his word.

				ROSARIO
		They will say anything to get what 
		they want, but then you remind them, 
		it's always tomorrow, tomorrow, 
		tomorrow.
			(beat)
		Occupational hazard, I guess.

	Javi just looks at her in the rearview mirror.

				ROSARIO
		His friend is giving us the apartment 
		so it's not like he paid.  It's more 
		like a favor.

	Javier pulls the SUV to the curb in front of a beautiful 
	colonial-style apartment complex in the verdant neighborhood.

	EXT. VERDANT NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

	Birds are chirping.  Javi waits in the car as Manolo takes 
	the young lady's bags from the vehicle and carries them up 
	the walkway to the arched doorway.  He knocks on the heavy 
	wooden door.

				ROSARIO
		You don't have the keys.  Oh that's 
		perfect.  Are you an idiot?

	Manolo knocks again.  They wait a long beat.

				MANOLO
		There's supposed to be someone here 
		to let you in.

	Finally, the door swings open and a BODYGUARD is standing 
	there.  Rosario SQUEALS and sweeps past him into the vast 
	space.  The bodyguard motions for Manolo to put the bags 
	inside the door.

	Manolo sets the bags down and sees another MAN standing a 
	few feet away.  The man wears sunglasses.  His complexion is 
	strange and his neck is bandaged.

	The body guard escorts Manolo back outside where he hears 
	Rosario's happy LAUGHTER drifting down from an upstairs 
	window.

	INT. SUV - DAY

	Manolo gets into the truck.  He's shaken by what he's just 
	seen.

				MANOLO
		Madrigal's alive.

				JAVIER
		What?

				MANOLO
		Porfirio Madrigal is not dead.  I 
		just saw him.

	A long beat as Javier considers this.

				JAVIER
		This is why Salazar is so interested 
		in cleaning up Tijuana.  Madrigal, 
		who's supposed to be dead, owns him.
		And Madrigal is making a move on

	Javier calmly drives away.

		The first thing we have to do is

				BARBARA
		If you start in on the war metaphors 
		I'm going to drive this car into a

				ROBERT
		Look, I'm as worried as you are --

				BARBARA
		No, I don't think so.  Leave me alone, 
		give me money.  That's what I get 
		from our daughter.  She has a way of 
		shutting me out that seems very 
		familiar.

				ROBERT
		Yeah, well, she has a way of self-

		familiar, too.

	She looks at him, stung.

				BARBARA
		I'm not the one who has to have three

		I have a drink before dinner to take

	INT. CAROLINE WAKEFIELD'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Robert stands outside her closed bathroom door.

	There is nothing, then from the other side of the door, the 
	faint sound of a lighter CLICKING.  AGAIN and AGAIN, then a 
	COUGH.

	INT. CAROLINE WAKEFIELD'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

	Caroline sits on the toilet.  Glamour Magazine on her lap.

	She's wild-eyed and paranoid.  The exhaust fan is running.

	The aluminum foil is on the sink.  The last little bit of 
	heroin in a wax-paper bundle sits beside it.

	She's listening hard for any SOUND in the house.  What she's 
	wondering is if someone is outside the door listening.

	She puts a piece of crack on the foil and listens hard once 
	more before lighting it.  She does the hit.

	And seems to feel better.

	Suddenly there's a POUNDING on the door.  The VOICE of her 
	father muffled through the solid wood.

				ROBERT (V.O.)
			(muffled by the door)
		Caroline.  Open this door immediately.

	Caroline is up like a shot.  She looks around.  The POUNDING 
	on the door gets stronger.

	She crumples the foil and drops it in the toilet.

	The bathroom door SOUNDS like it's about to cave inward.

				CAROLINE
			(faking the best she 
			can)
		Who is it?  I'm going to the bathroom.

	She's coping now, full parallel process mode: she dumps the 
	last heroin on the back of her hand and snorts it, checking 
	her nose in the mirror as she reaches for a can of air 
	freshener which she sprays into the air.

				CAROLINE
		One minute.

	She takes the remaining crack, lighters, tubes, little smudgy 
	druggy bits of paraphernalia and carefully places it all in 
	a hiding place above the bathroom cabinet.

	She pauses a beat, then opens the door, and tries to brush 
	by her father while avoiding his eyes.

				CAROLINE
		Excuse me --

	Robert grabs her by the arms.  He pushes her against the 
	wall and looks at her pupils.  He looks at her fingernails.  
	The blister on her thumb from working the lighter is red and 
	irritated.

				ROBERT
		You're not going anywhere, young 
		lady.

	She stands there; she's very high.

	Robert sniffs the air.  He throws open cabinets, searching 
	for drugs.  He sees the smudge mark on the counter left by 
	the charred aluminum foil.

				ROBERT
		Where is it?  Where are the drugs?
			(yelling)
		Where are they?

				CAROLINE
		Fuck you.  I wasn't doing anything.  
		You're like the Gestapo.

	Robert KICKS the cabinets.

				ROBERT
		Fuck me?  Oh, okay.  Fuck me.  Fuck 
		you.

	Robert is losing it.  He throws stuff around the bathroom 
	and then, for the first time, looks up.  He sees the long 
	light in the box atop the medicine cabinet and it dawns on 
	him.

				ROBERT
		I'm going to ask you one time to 
		tell me the truth so that I can help 
		you.

	She just stares.

				ROBERT
		Okay, young lady, that's it.

				CAROLINE
		Like I give a fuck.

	Robert reaches above the medicine cabinet and pulls out a 
	charred spoon.  It confuses him.  He throws it into the sink.

	He pulls out another spoon.  He pulls out crumpled bindles, 
	rolled up, encrusted dollar bills, exhausted lighters, a 
	pill bottle, an empty pint of vodka.

	The detritus of drug addiction keeps on coming, filling up 
	the sink.  Robert stares at it, the amount and complexity 
	has him momentarily baffled.

				ROBERT
		What is wrong with you?  What?
			(beat)
		You're going away.  You're getting 
		help somewhere.

	fiend, yuppie crack-head, fat, thin, rich, middle-class, and 
	all white.  Caroline is the youngest.

	MARTY, 40's, an overweight alcoholic, finishes his "share."

				MARTY
		So it was my birthday an my ex-wife 
		was getting remarried and I was in 
		some church basement telling a bunch 
		of strangers how it was a good day 
		because I didn't have to eat out of 
		a dumpster.  That was enough to send 
		me out on big one.
			(beat)
		I've been thinking a lot about the 
		first step: that I came to believe I 
		was powerless over alcohol and that 
		my life had become unmanageable.
			(beat)
		See my disease tells me I don't have 
		a disease.  That I'm fine.  That 
		it's my birthday and I can have one 
		little drink, then one little line, 
		then one little Valium, then two 
		more fat lines, then two more 10 mil 
		Valium... Six months later I wake up 
		in a sober living house in Philly.  
		And I'm from Dallas, people.
			(beat)
		It's a disease -- an allergy of the 
		body and an obsession of the mind.  
		I know that now.  So my name's Marty 
		and today I'm a grateful recovering 
		alcoholic who didn't eat out of a 
		dumpster.  Thanks.

	And Marty looks to Caroline who didn't relate to one word he 
	said.

				CAROLINE
			(slowly, very nervous)
		Hi.  I'm Caroline.  I'm not sure I'm 
		an alcoholic.
			(beat)
		I mean I don't really like to drink.  
		For someone my age it's so much easier 
		to get drugs than beer.  I don't 
		know, this is really weird and I'm 
		really nervous...

	People in the room nod encouragingly.

				CAROLINE
		I guess I'm angry.  I mean I think 
		I'm really angry about a lot of stuff, 
		but I don't know what exactly.

	She blushes, and stares out the window.

	INT. AYALA LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

	Helena follows an ART APPRAISER through her formal living 
	room as he inspects paintings and makes notations.  He is 
	very excited and moves quickly from one to the next.

				ART APPRAISER
		Tamayo.  Carrington.  A simply 
		wonderful collection of Mexican 
		Modern.  Give me three months.  I 
		know several collectors in South 
		America, very discreet.

				HELENA
		I don't have three months.

				ART APPRAISER
		It takes time to find the proper 
		collection.

				HELENA
		How much will you give me in cash?  
		Today.

	The appraiser taps out some numbers on a calculator and shows 
	the figure to Helena.

				HELENA
		You must be joking.  That's a fraction 
		of their value.

				ART APPRAISER
		I'm sorry, but that is the figure I 
		can get today.

	Helena turns her back.  She walks to a window and looks out, 
	then surveys the contents of her beautiful home.

				HELENA
			(snapping)
		Get out.  Get out of my house.

	Helena turns and sees David in the doorway.  She goes to 
	him.

				HELENA
		It's all right.  We're have a 
		disagreement, that's all.

	The art appraiser passes them on his way out.

	INT. AYALA MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Helena wakes up in the middle of the night with a start.  
	Her eyes are wide open.  She has had a thought --

	She climbs out of bed and quickly puts on a robe.

	INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Helena walks quickly and quietly down the hallway.  She passes 
	David's room.  She opens a door at the end of the hall --

	INT. CARL'S PRIVATE STUDY - CONTINUOUS

	Helena enters the room.  She hits a desk lamp and we're in a 
	very comfortable and masculine upstairs study: bookshelves 
	holding hundreds of art books; comfortable chairs; MacIntosh 
	stereo; discreet flatscreen HD TV.

	Helena stares at a painting on one of the bookshelves.  It 
	is "Boy with a Hoop," a small portrait by Rafael Colonel.

	She goes to it and looks from different angles.  She reaches 
	out and jiggles the oil.  Nothing happens.  She looks behind 
	the painting at the backing.

	She notices that one corner is not glued down.  She picks up 
	a letter opener and pries the paper back.  An envelope slips 
	out.

	Inside the envelope: neat, thin strips of paper dense with 
	information in a miniscule type and a magnetic key card.

				SALAZAR
		I recruited the best men in Mexico 
		for my task force and put them through 
		a rigorous screening process.  Not 
		only physical, but also psychological.

				ROBERT
		I'd like to bring you up to 
		Washington, walk you around our side 
		of things, and share some of the 
		information we've been able to develop 
		on your cartels.

				SALAZAR
		That would be very helpful to me.
			(beat)
		Also, I received the offer from DEA 
		and the FBI to train some of my men 
		at Quantico.  I think this will be

	The office hasn't been decorated yet.

				SALAZAR
		I've been too busy to completely

	Salazar proffers a chair and they sit next to each other 
	like Brezhnev and Nixon.  PHOTOGRAPHERS begin SNAPPING 
	pictures.  After a few moments, Salazar waves them away, and 
	they lower their cameras and leave.

				ROBERT
		You've been making very good progress 
		against the Tijuana cartel.

				SALAZAR
		Yes, I am confident that Juan Obregon 
		will be taken into custody before 
		the end of the year.  But, you must 
		understand that it is very difficult 
		because of corruption in the police 
		force.  We get a tip that he is one 
		place, then we get there and he is 
		already gone, having been warned by 
		someone on our side.

				ROBERT
		Hopefully the exchange of training 
		methods and information between our 
		countries will help with this problem.

				SALAZAR
		Yes, I hope so as well.

				ROBERT
		Let me ask you a related question.  
		We've talked about the supply side, 
		but what about demand?  What is your 
		policy for treating addiction?

				SALAZAR
		Addicts treat themselves... they 
		overdose and then there's one less 
		to worry about.

				CASTRO
		Eddie, how you like your new home?  
		I hope you hate it as much as I do.

	Ruiz looks around with disgust.  He's accustomed to finer

		He first came to me in January.  
		That would've been nineteen eighty-

	the witness --

				SHEILA
		I was the company secretary from 
		1991 to 1994.  I supposedly worked 
		for all six companies.  But... they 
		weren't... I mean, it was just one 
		empty office with a desk and a 
		telephone.  We never sold anything 
		the whole time I was there.  Sometimes 
		people came and got paid.  I don't 
		really know what we did.

				PROSECUTOR
		Did Mr. Ayala say where the money 
		came from?

				SHEILA
		No, and I didn't ask.

				PROSECUTOR
		Where do you think it came from?

	Carl's lawyer, Adler, is on his feet --

		I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the

	INT. SKETCH'S BEDROOM - DAY

	A single candle lights the room.  Caroline is underneath 
	Sketch the drug dealer.  He is pounding away.  As she clutches 
	his back and holds on, her expression is both surprised and 
	druggy, and SOUNDS escape her mouth that she wouldn't believe 
	she could make.

	There's a KNOCK on the door.  Sketch continues his business.  
	The KNOCKING is more insistent.  Finally, he stops and gets 
	up and goes to the door.  Caroline lies back.  She's in a 
	bed with black sheets in a room with nothing else in it but 
	a dresser and some duffle bags.

	Sketch opens the door --

				SKETCH
		What the fuck do you want?

	SOMEBODY outside says something.  Sketch walks over to a 
	duffle bag and extracts some product.  Caroline's eyes are 
	glued to it as Sketch hands it through the door.  Sketch 
	sees her staring at the drugs.

	He comes back to bed.

				SKETCH
		You want some of that?

	Caroline nods.

		What you gonna do to get some of 
		that?

				CAROLINE
		Please --

				SKETCH
		What you gonna do?

	She turns her back to him, pouting.  He laughs.

				SKETCH
		Maybe a taste.

	He reaches over beside the bed where there is a small tray.

	On the tray is a rig, spoon, several powders, and an eye 
	dropper.  He pulls the candle over and rapidly fixes a 
	speedball.  He pulls the fluid into the neck of the syringe 
	and holds it up the light.  It has Caroline transfixed.

				SKETCH
		Feed this to you like a little bird.

	He squirts the tiniest amount of fluid into the air.  It 
	arcs in the candlelight.

				CAROLINE
		Don't --

		You want this?

	She nods.

		This is the Express train.  Baby

	Her concentration is entirely, hypnotically focused on the 
	syringe.

	Sketch moves the syringe toward her lips.

				SKETCH
		Kiss it.  Kiss your new mommy hello.

	Caroline moves her mouth toward the side of the syringe, her 
	lips part.

	Sketch pulls the sheet back, exposing her legs.  He grips 
	one powerful hand around her ankle and squeezes... Veins 
	stand out on her foot.

	He slides the needle into the largest vein and slowly 
	depresses the plunger.

	Caroline watches, then her head tilts back, then forward, 
	she GROANS, sexually and slumps against the pillows, her 
	eyes half-open, her lips twitching.

		What are you gonna have?

				MANOLO
		A steak.

				MAN #1
		Well, if you like steak, we know a 
		much better place.  We'll take you

				MANOLO
		That's okay, really.

	They each take Manolo by an arm.

				MAN #2
		Manolo, we should really be going

	INT. SUV - DAY

	We're looking through the windshield as we approach the 
	Mexican border.  As the car slows, we pan to follow the border 
	official as he looks in briefly and waves us through.  We 
	continue to pan to reveal Manolo in the backseat sitting 
	beside Man #2.

	INT. SUV - DAY

	We're in the desert.  There's nothing in any directions.

	Javi is implacable.  Manolo understands what is happening.

				MANOLO
		I was going to feed them wrong 
		information.  Feed them lies to...  
		it was for...

	The men say nothing.  After a beat --

				MANOLO
		Don't tell Anna I died like this.  
		Tell her it was something else.  
		Tell her it was official business.  
		Tell her that I died doing something 
		honorable.  Please, tell her that 
		for me...

	EXT. DESERT - DAY

	Javi and Manolo stand next to two freshly dug graves.

				MAN #1
		Turn around.

	Javi hesitates before turning.  We're on Javi as we hear the 
	GUNSHOT.  Javi doesn't flinch.  Manolo's body falls into the 
	grave.

	Javi stands there, waiting.

				MAN #1
		You got anything you want to say?

	Javi shakes his head.  Finally, another GUNSHOT.  After a 
	beat, a hand reaches out of Javi's shoulder.

				MAN #1
		Sorry about that... we had to be 
		sure.

	They walk back to the SUV.

				SOMEBODY ELSE
		Are you sure you don't have anything 
		to tell us?

	Javi says nothing, doesn't even acknowledge them.  We hear a 
	GUNSHOT.

				ARNIE
		That was a stupid thing you did.  
		Incredibly stupid.

				HELENA
		I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue 
		to try.

				ARNIE
		Have you gone crazy?  You are not 
		Carl.  You aren't as good as Carl.
			(beat)
		They are moving the trial to a high

		Let us try to win the case.

				HELENA
		That is going to be rather difficult 
		when all the evidence is against us.

	Helena steps closer to Arnie, close enough that her breasts 
	are almost touching his chest.

				ARNIE
		Helena, please.  This is out of your

				HELENA
			(softly)
		I know I made things worse.  I know

	Helena looks searchingly into his eyes.

		Helena --

				HELENA
		I need an introduction to the Obregon

		I can't do that.

	Helena leans closer to him.

	This is a professional chemical lab that can be rented by

	frisbees, hula hoops - on many of the tables.

	Helena lets herself into the room.  She scans ledgers. She

		About the other night, I'm sorry.

	INT. CAROLINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Robert is standing in the middle of her room.  He's not sure 
	what he's looking for.  Everywhere he looks: her personal 
	things, beloved objects from more innocent times, pictures.

	Within moments a legitimate desire to connect with his 
	daughter has escalated into a search for clues.  He opens 
	her drawers, dumps little boxes, pulls things off of shelves.

	He becomes increasingly unhinged, flinging things around her 
	room.  He tosses a stack of magazines.  A fashion magazine, 
	airborne, discharges some contents: a lighter, a plastic 
	tube and a piece of folded aluminum foil fluttering to the 
	ground.

	Robert stares at the foil on the carpet.  It's charred on 
	the outside.  He picks it up.  And unfolds it.  There's a 
	dried milky white substance.

	He picks up the tube and lighter and stares at them.  Then, 
	somewhat tentatively, he puts the tube in his mouth.  He 
	holds the lighter under the foil, then heats the milky 
	substance which turns translucent and disappears in a cloud 
	of smoke.  Robert sucks all of it in.

	He waits a long time then exhales.  His eyes shut.  The tube 
	drops from his mouth.  He staggers and, overwhelmed by the 
	sensations, sits on the bed.  The lighter and foil fall from 
	his hands.

	A moment later he opens his eyes and doesn't seem to know 
	where he is.  He looks at the room, confused.  He stumbles 
	to the door and shuts it firmly behind him.

	Javi drives through the streets of Tijuana.  He brakes for a 
	stop sign and watches, trance-like, the pedestrians crossing

	A HONK from behind brings him back and he pulls forward 
	passing Helena Ayala who crosses going the opposite direction.  
	We stay with her.

	INT. CLUB PLATINUM - DAY

	A shrewd Obregon Lieutenant, JUAN MARQUEZ, 40, sits at a 
	table opposite Helena.  The Strange Man who both threatened 
	Helena's child and executed Francisco sits in another chair.

				MARQUEZ
		Mrs. Ayala.  Thank you for coming.  
		I am Juan Marquez, I work for Mr.  
		Obregon.  I believe you know my 
		associate, "Tigrillo," the Little 
		Tiger.

	Helena nods to Tigrillo --

				HELENA
		Yes, he threatened to kill my five 
		year-old son.
			(beat)
		I was under the impression I would 
		be meeting Juan Obregon.

				MARQUEZ
		No, this is not possible.  And I 
		thank you for coming down here, though 
		I suspect it's been a pointless 
		journey.

				HELENA
		Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?

				MARQUEZ
		I hear these stories.  Your husband 
		in jail.  His business in chaos.  
		Various people fighting over the 
		scraps.

				HELENA
		My husband is the victim of an 
		informer in your organization, not 
		ours.

				MARQUEZ
		That is not true, Mrs. Ayala.  Your 
		route is compromised.  Perhaps it is 
		time for me to deal with other 
		distributors in California.

				HELENA
		I don't think you're going to do 
		that.

				MARQUEZ
		You don't?  Listen to this woman in 
		a man's world, a very violent world.

				HELENA
		There are plenty of other suppliers 
		in Mexico.

				MARQUEZ
		But not in whose interest it is to 
		help you out of debt.

	Helena reaches into her bag and pulls out the Spastic Jack 
	action figure.  She puts it on the desk.

				HELENA
		My husband had been working on 
		something he called, The Project for 
		the Children.  Are you aware of this?

				MARQUEZ
		I don't know.  Perhaps I remember 
		something.

				HELENA
		We have the ability to change the 
		color, odor, and physical property 
		of cocaine.

				MARQUEZ
		You want to smuggle narcotics in Mr.  
		Espastico Jacobo.  That's nothing 
		new.

				HELENA
		Not in...

	Juan Marquez is confused.

				HELENA
		This doll is cocaine.

	Juan picks up Spastic Jack and looks at him.  He bangs it on 
	the desk.

				HELENA
		Every part, from his ears to his 
		accessory belt, is high-impact, 
		pressure-molded cocaine.  Odorless.  
		Undetectable by dogs.  Undetectable 
		by anyone.

				MARQUEZ
		I don't believe you.

	She takes out the "solvent" and puts it on his desk.

				HELENA
		Get a bowl.

	INT. CLUB PLATINUM - OFFICE - LATER

	Spastic Jack is slowly dissolving in a bowl of solvent.  
	Only his shoulders, head, and ridiculous ears remain above 
	the quicksand of milky glop.

	Helena holds a mirror under the desk lamp.  She is drying 
	the paste.  She puts the mirror on the desk.  A white 
	substance has coagulated there.

				HELENA
		Try it.

	Juan takes out a razor blade and chops the dried substance 
	into two white powder lines.  He hands a silver straw to 
	Helena.

				MARQUEZ
		You first.

				HELENA
		I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do 
		it.

				MARQUEZ
		Fine, then we don't have deal.

				HELENA
		Fine, then we don't have a deal.

	She stands.  He watches her a beat, then smiles.

				MARQUEZ
		Okay, okay.

	He leans down and quickly snorts a line.  After a beat.

				MARQUEZ
		That's good coke.

				HELENA
		It should be... It's yours.
			(beat)
		I want our debt forgiven.  I want to 
		be the exclusive distributor of 
		Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the 
		United States.  And I want the 
		principle witness against my husband, 
		Eduardo Ruiz, killed.

				MARQUEZ
		Perhaps... Perhaps... I'm afraid I 
		must first ask you to pass a test.  
		I asked the same of your husband and 
		he succeeded with flying colors.

	Helena waits.  Juan Marquez reaches in his desk and pulls 
	out a quarter kilo of cocaine.  He pushes it across the desk.

				MARQUEZ
		Take this back with you.  Deliver it 
		safely to Tigrillo in San Diego and 
		we have a deal.

				HELENA
		That's crazy.  My husband is on trial 
		for smuggling.

				MARQUEZ
		Exactly, and this is how I know I'm 
		not getting into business with the 
		U.S. Government.

	She puts the quarter key in her bag and stands.

				HELENA
		You will help me with my other 
		problem.

				MARQUEZ
		Deliver that safely to Tigrillo in 
		San Diego.  And we have a deal.

	Tigrillo escorts her out of the room.

	Robert closes the distance.  Seth pounds harder.

				SETH
		I know she's in there.  Let me talk 
		to her.

				MUFFLED VOICE
		I don't know what you're talking 
		about.  Go away!

	Robert reaches the door.  Seth sees him.

				SETH
		I know she's in there.

	Robert kicks the door in.

	INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

	Robert sees a middle-aged JOHN in his underwear and a dress 
	shirt.

				JOHN
		Hey, I haven't touched her --

	Caroline is passed out on the bed.  Robert goes to her as 
	the John scrambles for his clothes.

	She stirs and sees him --

				CAROLINE
			(really out of it)
		Hi, Daddy.

	INT. ROBERT'S CAR - DAY

	Caroline rides in the passenger seat.  She's come out of her 
	stupor and is now filled with ebullience.

				CAROLINE
		It's gonna be great...  I mean, I'm 
		okay and all, because, see, I met a 
		guy, he's in this pretty famous band 
		and...
			(gets up confessional 
			courage)
		They've invited me to write lyrics 
		for them, I'm gonna be able to do 
		that and maybe sing, too... not at 
		first, but later.

	Caroline gets lost in her grandiose vision.  Robert looks 
	over at her as she drifts off into a nod.  A moment later 
	she's awake and rambling again.

				CAROLINE
			(sounding completely 
			crazy)
		I've been doing research for the 
		school paper, that's what I've been 
		doing, like on assignment kind-of, 
		I've seen some stuff you wouldn't 
		believe, but I'm gonna write it all 
		down into lyrics.  They think I'm 
		really good, everybody says so, what 
		do you think?

	Robert fights back tears.  He reaches over and takes his 
	daughter's hand.

				MARQUEZ
		Salazar and Madrigal are no longer

		A feat none of these people could

	Juan nods toward Pablo and Tigrillo.

				MARQUEZ
		You're going to be made the Special

	INTERCUT ROBERT IN HIS OFFICE

	He holds the phone and doesn't say anything.

							CUT TO:

	INT. COURTROOM - EARLY MORNING

	The court is searched carefully by a phalanx of OFFICERS.  
	Metal Detectors are checked.  Bomb sniffing German Shepherds 
	are led through the space.

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - MORNING

	The agents are unkempt and everyone is tired.  Ruiz moves 
	through a cluttered room in a bathrobe with a cup of coffee.

	An agent shows him a morning paper --

				AGENT
		Big day.
			(shows picture in 
			paper)
		You're a star.

	Ruiz walks over and sits across from Gordon, switching off 
	the radio show he's listening to.  Gordon looks up from his 
	paper.

				GORDON
		Go shower.  You smell.

	There is a KNOCK on the front door.  An AGENT goes to answer --

				AGENT
		Who is it?

				SOMEBODY (V.O.)
			(through the door)
		The Mafia.  I've got his breakfast.

	The agent opens the door and is handed a breakfast tray.  He 
	puts the food in front of Ruiz who uncovers the sausage and 
	eggs.

	An agent walking by tries to take a bite of sausage.  Ruiz 
	stabs it with a fork --

				RUIZ
		Fuck off.

	Gordon watches the interchange --

				GORDON
		Where's the love gone, Eddie?

	You'll be testifying for at least ten days.  What if we stop 
	feeding you?

	Ruiz begins to eat hungrily.

				RUIZ
		You expect me to be grateful for 
		spending the rest of my life looking 
		over my shoulder.

				GORDON
		That thought makes me feel awful.

	Ruiz pushes eggs into a piece of toast.

				RUIZ
		Can't you for a second imagine none 
		of this had happened?  That my drugs 
		had gone through.  What would have 
		been the harm?  A few people get 
		high who are getting high anyway.  
		Your partner is still alive.  We 
		avoid having breakfast together.  
		Don't you see this means nothing?  
		That your whole life is pointless?

				GORDON
		You're breaking my heart.

				RUIZ
		The worst thing about you, Monty, is 
		you realize the futility of what 
		you're doing and you do it anyway.  
		I wish you could see how transparent 
		you are.
			(disgusted)
		This food tastes like shit.

				GORDON
		So go shower already.

				RUIZ
		You only got to me because you were 
		tipped off by the Juarez Cartel, 
		who's trying to break into Tijuana.  
		You're helping them.
			(beat)
		You work for a drug dealer too, Monty.

	Ruiz stands and heads for the bathroom.

				GORDON
			(yelling after him)
		And shave.  You better look nice and 
		believable for the jury.

	Ruiz disappears into the bathroom and slams the door behind 
	him.

				GORDON
			(to another agent)
		It's like having another wife.

	The agent laughs.  There's another KNOCK on the door.

				GORDON
		Who is it?

				SOMEBODY ELSE (V.O.)
			(though the door)
		Breakfast.

	Gordon and the agent look at each other.

				SOMEBODY ELSE
		Hurry up.  It's getting cold.

	Gordon moves to the side of the door and pulls his gun.  The 
	other agent opens the door.

	A MAN with a breakfast tray enters.  Gordon puts the gun to 
	the side of his head.

				MAN WITH TRAY
		I'm on your side.  God, you're jumpy.

	Gordon is momentarily confused, then goes for the bathroom 
	door.

				GORDON
		Call an ambulance.  Hurry.

	Gordon tries the bathroom door.  It's stuck.  He gets it 
	open a crack.  There's a body against the other side.  He 
	shoves.

	INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Ruiz is on the floor in convulsions.

				GORDON
			(yelling)
		Call the ambulance.
			(to Ruiz)
		Don't die on me.  You will not die 
		on me.  Do you hear me?  Don't you 
		die on me.

	Ruiz's convulsions get worse, his claw-like fingers scratch 
	across the tile.

				CHIEF OF STAFF
		Yeah, hi --
			(waves Robert to a 
			chair)
		So I've got a copy of your speech 
		here...
			(glances down, still 
			reading)
		It's fantastic... So, Robert, my 
		genuine thanks.  You're my choice 
		and you're gonna be great.  The 
		President is sorry he hasn't been 
		able to spend more time with you.  
		After the press conference he wants 
		to really sit down.
			(an afterthought)
		Oh, I got to the Post, too.  Don't 
		worry about that thing with your 
		daughter, it's not news; they're 
		willing to treat it as a family 
		matter, a personal matter.
			(off Robert's stare)
		Look, even if it came out, we'd turn 
		it into a qualification, I've been 
		in the trenches of this Drug War, I 
		have seen the face of the enemy,

	Robert just stares at him.

	INT. JAIL CELL - DAY

	General Salazar sits in the same grimy cell that housed 
	Francisco Flores.  He is sweating and his breathing is 
	labored.  A DOCTOR enters and gives him an injection, 
	explaining that it will calm him down.

	EXT. DESERT OUTSIDE TIJUANA - DAY

	It's a reprise of the earlier desert bust... a landing strip 
	in the middle of nowhere, a plane landing, SUV's approaching.

	This time Javi is at the wheel of one of them.  News crews 
	are trailing behind him.

	EXT. DESERT AIRSTRIP - LATER

	Javi and Special Agent Hughes stand next to a giant mound of 
	seized cocaine, the same cocaine, in fact, Javi held briefly 
	at the beginning.  The same teenagers from the pickup truck 
	have been arrested.  The news crews get everything.

				JAVIER
			(to the press)
		This seizure is one of the largest 
		seizures in Mexican history...  It 
		represents the first bilateral effort 
		of the American DEA and the Mexican 
		I.N.C.D.

	INT. JAIL CELL - DAY

	General Salazar lies on his side, eyes and mouth open.  He 
	is dead.  Javier looks at him through the doorway.

				JAVIER (V.O. CONT'D)
		Today I'm very proud to announce 
		that Mexico, with the help of our 
		American partners, is finally winning 
		the war against narcotics trafficking.

	Robert and Javi walk through the headquarters, a nondescript 
	government building.

	Robert extracts photographs of the bust from a manila 
	envelope.  The crates of cocaine are clearly marked "911."

				ROBERT
		The cocaine brand, 911, is an East 
		Coast brand, a Juarez Cartel brand, 
		and you must know it usually comes 
		through into El Paso?

				JAVIER
		I'm aware of that.

				ROBERT
		So what's it doing in Tijuana?

	Javi looks Robert Wakefield squarely in the eye.  He shrugs.

				ROBERT
		Let me ask you a hypothetical 
		question: if Salazar worked for 
		Madrigal and the Juaraz cartel, and 
		he went out of power, would it mean 
		the Juarez Cartel is losing influence?

				JAVIER
		It could mean that, yes.

				ROBERT
		That would probably mean the Tijuana 
		Cartel is gaining power?

				JAVIER
		It's possible.

				ROBERT
		Is it possible to have a Drug Czar 
		in Mexico who isn't connected in 
		some war to one of the cartels?

	Javi thinks along time before answering.

				JAVIER
		Yeah, it's possible... if you're 
		prepared to die.

	EXT. AYALA FRONT YARD - AFTERNOON

	An outdoor party is going on.  Children and adults arrive 
	and mingle.  Caterers work the barbecue grill.  Waiters serve 
	food and drink on the rolling lawn.

	Helena circles through the crowd greeting friends.  She looks 
	past her tree line and up the street where a telephone repair 
	van is parked.  She turns back toward her guests.  Somebody 
	has raised a cup and everyone is CHEERING.

	Helena drinks with her guests, then walks inside her house.

	AT THE FRONT GATE

	Montel Gordon walks through the gate and up the drive.  He 
	grabs a drink off the tray of a passing waiter.  He appears 
	drunk.

	Montel follows Helena into the house.

	INT. CARL'S PRIVATE STUDY - AFTERNOON

	Carl hears the CHEERING outside and the sound of LAUGHTER.

	He makes a cellular telephone call.

	Arnie is in his office and answers the cell phone --

		It's Saturday, Arnie.  You work too 
		hard.

				ARNIE
		Carl, I'm running late.  I'm coming 
		right now --

	Behind Arnie in the office there is a movement of SHADOW.

	INT. CARL'S PRIVATE STUDY - AFTERNOON

	Carl stands at the window looking at his guests while he 
	talks on the phone --

				CARLOS
		Don't bother.

				ARNIE (V.O.)
		What?

				CARLOS
		So Arnie, when were you going to 
		tell me about the 3 million dollars 
		we got in from San Francisco two 
		days after I got arrested?

				ARNIE (V.O.)
		I was just waiting for the right 
		time.

				CARLOS
		And you didn't feel like you could 
		trust my wife with this news?

				ARNIE (V.O.)
		I just didn't want to take a chance.  
		I didn't want to risk it.  It could 
		have been frozen along with everything 
		else.

				CARLOS
		You had it all figured out.  You 
		move into my house.  You raise my 
		kids.  You sleep with my wife.  It 
		was a good plan, Arnie.

				ARNIE (V.O.)
		Carl, that's insane.

				CARLOS
		So my wife is lying?

				ARNIE (V.O.)
		Carl, think about it, if I was trying 
		to rip you off, I would have left 
		town after Ruiz was killed.  I 
		wouldn't sit next to you in court 
		listening to the dismissal.

	On the front lawn CHILDREN are lined up for the ice-cream 
	sundae bar that is being tended by a WAITER.

				CARLOS
		Arnie, do think there's a difference

	Carl hears MUFFLED GUNSHOTS over the phone.  He hangs up and 
	turns from the window.  Helena is standing there.

				HELENA
		Who was that?

				CARLOS
		Arnie.  He's not going to be able to 
		make the barbecue.

	Carl and Helena share an embrace and a kiss.

				HELENA
		Come downstairs.  Everyone is waiting.

	Carl and Helena turn to leave the room and Montel Gordon is 
	standing in the doorway with his glass of champagne.

				GORDON
		Hello, Helena.  What a great party.

				CARLOS
		Who are you?

				GORDON
		Nobody.  I'm a nobody who arrested 
		you, but your wife is a murderer.

	Gordon takes a sip of his drink.  Two SECURITY OFFICERS appear 
	in the doorway behind him.

				SECURITY OFFICER
		Hey, you can't be in here.

				GORDON
		I'm a cop.

				SECURITY OFFICER
		I don't care.

				HELENA
			(to the guards)
		Throw him out of here.

	The security officers grab Gordon.  There is a scuffle.  
	Gordon falls to the floor by the window.  They are wrestling.

	As they wrestle, Gordon reaches out and, unnoticed, affixes 
	TINY LISTENING DEVICE underneath the desk.

	He continues to struggle with the guards.  Helena and Carlos 
	start from the room.

				GORDON
			(calling out)
		You didn't win, Helena.  You lost 
		everything.  Tell your children a 
		nice bedtime story...  How you killed

				PRESS SECRETARY
		...a sterling reputation and close 
		friend of the President, recently 
		confirmed into The Office of National 
		Drug Control Policy... our new Drug 
		Czar, Robert Hudson Wakefield.

	Applause from the assembled PRESS.  The Press Secretary 
	signals and Robert walks to the podium.  He looks back to 
	the Chief of Staff; he stares out at the expectant faces and 
	television lights and camera flashes.

				ROBERT
			(reading his prepared 
			speech)
		The War on Drugs is a war on our 
		nation's most precious resource...  
		our children.  Sixty-eight million 
		children have been targeted by those 
		who perpetrate this war and protecting 
		those children must be priority number 
		one.
			(beat)
		There has been progress and there 
		have been failures, but where we 
		have fallen short I see not a problem 
		but an opportunity.

	Robert is becoming increasingly uneasy.  He glances at the 
	Chief of Staff who bores into him.  He looks again at his 
	speech.  With great effort he continues.

				ROBERT
		An opportunity to correct the mistakes 
		of the past while laying a solid 
		foundation for the future.
			(a long, uncomfortable 
			beat)
		This takes not only new ideas, but 
		perseverance.  This takes not only 
		resources, but courage.  This takes 
		not only government, but families.

	Robert stops again as though the words are choking him.

				ROBERT
		I've... I've outlined a ten-point 
		plan, representing a new bilateral 
		effort...

	He can't finish.  Everyone stares at Robert.  The crowd of 
	reporters senses something is wrong.

				ROBERT
		I can't do this.
			(beat)
		If there is a War on Drugs then our 
		own families have become the enemy.  
		How can you wage war on your own 
		family?

	He walks out of the room.  The crowd waits, expecting him to 
	return.

	Robert walks down a corridor and out of the White House.

	EXT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

	A beautiful spring morning.  He walks down to Pennsylvania

	INT. CHURCH BASEMENT - DAY

	A twelve step meeting is in progress.  Caroline shares from 
	her seat.

				CAROLINE
		On the good days I feel like I get

		stay in the moment.  I don't have to 
		control everything in the future.  
		And I believe everything is going to 
		work out fine.
			(beat)
		On the bad days, I just want to grab 
		the phone and start dialing numbers.  
		I want to pull my hair and run through 
		the streets screaming.
			(beat)
		But, thanks to the people I've met 
		in these rooms, people like Margaret 
		and Jim and Sarah, people who've 
		taught me how to listen, I'm pretty 
		sure I'll make it through today.

	Caroline is finished sharing.

		Would you like to share?

	We pan over to reveal Robert and Barbara sitting next to
