1   EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS MANSION - NIGHT                             1

    A Toyota parks and five teenagers get out and walk towards
    us, down a quiet residential street in the Hollywood Hills.

    One of them, a slightly drunk girl in a pale blue Juicy sweat
    suit stumbles.

                        DRUNK GIRL (NICKI)
                        (laughing)
              Shit.

                        GIRL 1 (REBECCA)
              C'mon. Hurry up.

    They come to a gated home. A girl that seems to be the
    leader, leans down and pulls on an unraveling part of the
    bottom of the chain link fence.

    She rolls under, and the others follow.

    A loud song kicks in as they put their sweatshirt hoods up in
    unison and turn around and walk backwards toward the house.

    They've done this before, they have it down.

    One checks under the mat of the front door, we follow them as
    they go around to the back, checking doors, and find a back
    window open.

    A guy gives Girl 1 a lift up, we see her bright underwear as
    she climbs inside into a laundry room.

    She runs around to open a side door for the rest, and they
    slip inside.
    Once inside, we follow REBECCA into a bedroom dressing area.
    She is the 17 yr-old Korean-American ring-leader, who is
    totally cool and composed.

    She looks over her shoulder at the others with a raised eye-
    brow.

                        REBECCA
              Let's go shopping!

    And she pulls open the closet door.

    CLOSE UP: grabbing Louis Vuitton bags.

    A drawer opens with a few Rolexes, that are scooped in to a
    Louis Vuitton duffle bag.

     An underwear drawer is opened, and picked through.

     A medicine cabinet is opened, a hand grabs bottles of
     prescription pills and dumps them in a bag.

     We see the other kids grabbing things and loading up bags.

     Rebecca puts on a hat she finds and looks at herself in a
     mirror posing, then gets back to it.

                today's lesson is about character
                development. In "The Secret" we
                talk about the law of attraction
                and we want to be careful about the
                people we surround ourselves with
                because we become the average of
                those people. So we're going to
                make a visual board of people who
                are demonstrating good character,
                like Angelina Jolie. So what are

      Flashes and coverage continues as they leave. Nicki sobs, we

                          INTERVIEWER
                We're here with Nicki Moore, who
                just served 30 days for her
                involvement in the Bling Ring, and
                shared a cell block with one of the
                victims- Lindsay Lohan. There were
                reports that Lindsay was crying,
                with you being next to her, did you
                actually hear any of this?
                          NICKI
                I could hear her crying the first
                day, which is hard when you're
                trying to be strong, I just tried
                to really keep to myself..., I just
                tried to get through the day , the
                days are so long you're woken up at
                5:30.

                had to take my weave out...she was
                in orange like all of us...

               Were you nervous you were next to
               her because you were accused of
               being a part of that group that
               allegedly robbed her house.

                         NICKI
               Yeah, it was hard for me there were
               tabloids and on T.V.s in there
               people were watching the story and
               they were showing the surveillance
               video and stuff... and little do
               people know that when that video
               came out I was actually in contact
               with her manager to tell her who I
               believed the people were who robbed
               her house... and eventually when
               I'm able to tell my story people
               will know the truth.

                         INTERVIEWER
               So that's nerve wracking she could
               think you robbed her house.

                         NICKI
               She could've, but you
               know...yeah...Anyway, you can
