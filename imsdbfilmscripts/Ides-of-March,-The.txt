          Stephen Meyers, Press Secretary to Governor Morris is
          standing at a podium on a stage...there is a single spotlight
          on him. The rest of the stage is dark.
          Stephen is talking into a mic with no emotion...just matter
          of factly.
                          STEPHEN
           I am neither Christian...nor
           atheist. I am not Jewish or
           Muslim. What I believe...my
           religion is called the
           constitution...
          A pause.
          Stephen snaps his fingers in the mic. We hear the distinct
          sound of feedback getting louder until it stops.
                         
          We hear the director speak over the loud speaker.

           Hang on...let me open these up....
          We wait as Stephen looks around. He looks at stage hands who
          are busy working. No one pays any attention to him as he
          stands there. This isn't awkward for Stephen, THIS IS
          ROUTINE.

           Also we'll need these podiums put
           on a riser as we agreed to in the
           pre-conditions. You're a few
           inches short and it makes it harder
           for the Governor to read his notes.

           See we're framing the argument
           based on the idea that
           homosexuality is a choice, you
           choose to be gay, not that you were
           born that way like being born
           black. Because if you start the
           discussion with the idea that gay
           is not a life choice but part of
           your DNA, then gay marriage is and
           can only be a civil rights issue.

           named McGuthrie. Had no money, no
           staff, no fuckin office. Everyone
           thought we didn't stand a chance.
           There's no way we can compete. And
           about this time, a guy running a
           congressional campaign a few
           districts over gives me a call.
           Says, "I really like what you were
           able to do for poor ole' Sam. But
           let's face it, he's a goner, so why
           don't you come work for me?" What
           do I do? Well Stephen -this is
           where you and I are different. I
           told Sam about the call. And Sam
           says to me, "Paul, you think this
           other's guy's got a shot at
           winning, and he can pay you more
           than anything I can afford, so if
           it's what you feel you need to do,
           then I won't get in your way." So I
           say, "Sam -you took a chance and
           hired me when I was even more of
           nobody than you are, and I'd be
           damned if I'm gonna jump ship just
           because the shit hit the fan."
           We lost the race, but three years
           later, when Sam decided to run for
           Governor -who do you think he
           called? We won that race.
