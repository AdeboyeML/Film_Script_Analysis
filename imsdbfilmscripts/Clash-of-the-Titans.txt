          nightmare CREATURES, their corpses now in piles to the
          horizon.
          The Dog climbs a mound of casualties. At the top, the

          SCREAM from within.
          Some members of the Royal Entourage look with scorn at
          their King, outraged by this double murder. Acrisius
          registers their disapproving looks and angrily turns to
          leave the promontory.

          The Wilting Girl steals down the dark, narrow alley,        
          headed toward the outskirts of town.
          Suddenly, a heavy wall shoots up from the cobblestones,     
          blocking her way. She startles, but does not stop. She
          goes up to the wall, turns at an angle and slides right
          through the stone, like a ghost.
          On the other side, she emerges from the stone, breathing    
          hard. She looks around and hurries down an intersecting
          passageway.

          thick vines shoot out and form a dense barrier. She
          takes a breath and dives into the surging growth.
          She almost makes it through, but at the last moment,        
          vines wrap her arms and legs, holding her prisoner. She

          WHISPERS. Shaikh Suleiman moves toward Perseus. The
          WHISPERING comes from behind his veil. He pulls a
          GLEAMING BRONZE SICKLE from his cloak. The priest, blade
          poised, stands over the sleeping Perseus.
          OUT OF THE DARKNESS runs Spyros, his harpoon raised for a

          frightening countenance: scaled skin of charred wood;

          Mongke and Tamburlane, in the center of the battle, find
          the opposition turning tail. They roar and lift their
          weapons high, surviving yet another fight. Spyros,
          bloodied but unbowed, smiles wide and sits down in the
          mud, exhausted.

          The water stills. The sea calms. No sign of Perseus or
          Andromeda. WIND and QUIET...

          lifeless countenance in agony -- has he failed again as      
          he did with Anteros the fisherman??                          
          Distraught, his muscles go taut around Andromeda, and a      
          short powerful burst of electric energy shoots from his
          arms into her still body -- SHE JOLTS TO LIFE!               
          Movement! Breath! Color returns to her face. Perseus,
          too, breathes again, relieved.
          For the first time since the start of the adventure, they
          find themselves alone, holding each other.

          Are you ready to become a king?

          Perseus raises one arm. The-AIR reverberates to a LOUD      
          BEATING OF WINGS. Andromeda looks up in wonder.
          Pegasus appears out of the sun's glare, gracefully          
          alighting on the water. Perseus helps Andromeda up and
          then climbs on behind her.

          Olympos.

          ZEUS the Prime, God of Gods, an eagle perched on his arm.
