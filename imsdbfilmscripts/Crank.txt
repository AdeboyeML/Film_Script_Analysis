              EXTREME CU: PACMAN, from the old video game, just a yellow
              ball with a mouth, fills the screen in all it's lo-res glory.
              The camera tracks along as it rolls along a tight corridor,
              gobbling dots.

              P.. but just before he catches up the BLUE GHOST transforms
              back to RED and changes direction again. PACMAN barely
              escapes.
                                                                       CUT TO:
          
              PACMAN flees, but at every turn he is confronted by another
              ghost. The CAMERA pulls out in a series of jump cuts to
              reveal that unlike the old arcade game, this game screen goes
              E forever, an infinite maze ... and instead of the original
              on four there are thousands of ghosts at all sides, closing in.

              The sound of the game redoubles, reverberates, deafening ...
                                                                 CUT TO BLACK.

              This scene plays out as a continuous POV shot, right up
              until CHEV's face is revealed for the first time.)
              CHEV CHELIOS, wakes up in his apartment to a RINGING CELL
              PHONE, groggy, vision doubled ...

          1    .. from his POV we see him examine his hands, which don't
              feel right, don't want to move right.

               He jams his head under the Fossil sink and runs the water.
               He steadies himself against the matching black marble
               counter, staring at his hands ...

               stunned...
          
               All the while we hear the faint sound of his HEARTBEAT...

               plain black VHS tape propped up in front of a plasma screen
               TV with police ribbon wrapped around it, tied in a bow, like
               a present.

               He grabs the thing, fumbles to unwrap it, shoves it into the
               VCR and pushes PLAY.

               It's RICKY VERONA on the SCREEN, a young, irritatingly slick

               We see him sitting on CHEV'S bed ... CHEV is visible in the
               frame, unconscious behind VERONA. Pale nicotine sunlight
               filters in through the blinds.   There are HOODS loitering
               around the room. It was apparently shot only hours before.
               (
                The discernible sound of CHEV'S heartbeat will subliminally
               increase in speed and volume throughout VERONA'S monologue -
               the cell phone continues to ring, somewhere.)

                            give you the heads up. You're dead.
          
               On the TV - VERONA points into the CAMERA.

                            Yeah, that's right, you little bitch ...
                            if you're watching this tape it means
                            that I somehow resisted the urge to
                            dismember you and shove the pieces down
                            the garbage disposal ... opting instead
                            to poison you in your sleep. Yeah, you
                            heard me...
          
               We stay with CHEV'S POV as he flashes a frantic glance around
               the room. The LUBDUB of the HEARTBEAT is much LOUDER AND
               FASTER NOW; we really begin to notice it.

                            How sick is that?... for the satisfaction
                            of watching you squirm out your last
                            minutes knowing it was me that did it to
                            you, and there's nothing you can do about
                            it...
          
               Cut to high angle view from a hidden lipstick camera; CHEV is 5
               on his knees in front of the set, looking around ... we still
               don't see his face clearly.

               Cut back to CHEV'S POV. He holds his head down over the               5
               carpet and shoves a finger in his mouth, GAGGING.

               The THUGS are into it; VERONA is rolling. One of them comes

               face, staring at the TV. CHEV is in his late 20s, handsome
               in an offhanded way. All of the background noise - the
               HEARTBEAT, the CELL PHONE - cuts to dead silence... and

               Finding a drunken man's strength, CHEV flips out. He rips
               the TV out of the stand, TEARING THE WIRES FROM THE GUTS OF
               THE WALL. He launches it straight into the floorboards with
               a BONE-BREAKING CRUSH.
          
               He KICKS over the rest of the entertainment system, JUMPS on
               it and heads out of the room.
          
               ROLLER DOLLY follows him on a STUMBLING RAMPAGE through the
               apartment and down the hall.
          
               By the door, in an ashtray with his car keys, he finds it:
               his God-damned CELL PHONE. Of course it stops ringing just
               as he picks it up. He pockets it, BANGS OPEN the front door
               and is out.

               ROLLER DOLLY still on CHEV. He jumps up on the hood of a
               moving RED SPORTSCAR as it backs out of it's parking spot,
               walks right over it and hops off, clicking the keyless lock
               button on his chain in mid-air ... the door to his BLACK AUDI
               pops open ... he gets in.
          
               RED SPORTSCAR GUY is the sort of classic intolerable LA
               ASSHOLE we love to hate: platinum hair, suspenders, designer
               shades, programming his Blackberry while driving, etc.

                         cockwipe!
          
               CHEV backs out, runs him right over. CH-KUNK, CH-KUNK.
               CHEV'S AUDI blasts out of the garage and down the street.
               SPORTSCAR GUY holds his backwards leg in agony.

                          had the stones to come whack me in my own

                            I'm dead and you're simple. Now listen:
                            you put the word out I'm looking for
                            Ricky Verona. Anyone sees him you call
                            me.
          
               KAYLO puts his hands up in the air, dumbfounded.

                            I'm going to get that little son of a
                            bitch if it's the last thing I do... it
                            may actually be the last thing I do,

               Arriving at his destination CHEV clicks off, simultaneously
               closing KAYLO'S SCREEN IN A SCREEN, and shoves the phone into
               his shirt pocket as he screeches up the sidewalk.

               EXT STREET, NEAR BLACK SABBATH CLUBHOUSE, MOMENTS LATER
          
                 run down street in Inglewood. The BLACK SABBATH CLUBHOUSE
               is a low lying pool hall/bar with a crude hand-painted sign
               reading BEER POOL DARTS. Motorcycles are parked out front.
          
                OLLER DOLLY from alongside CHEV'S car at high speed, break
               off and follow inside as CHEV parks haphazardly, rushes out
               and busts into the joint ...

               The continuous ROLLER DOLLY move takes us inside and KEEPS
               GOING. Eight or ten BROTHERS, some wearing motorcycle
               leathers, are scattered around the room, shooting stick,
               drinking, etc. CHEV BARGES IN, drawing a GLOK .45 from his
               coat and goes straight at ORLANDO - black, hip, 30's, better
               dressed than the others - who is at the center of a group of
               BADASSES.
          
                efore anyone has time to react CHEV has the GUN PRESSED INTO
               ORLANDO'S FOREHEAD and is pushing him through the place into
               the bathroom. Everyone scatters and takes cover at the site
               of the GLOK; firearms appear.

          CHEV locks the door, SLAMS ORLANDO against the far wall and
          starts circling around him with the gun beaded on ORLANDO'S
          forehead.
          
                                 CHEV
                           (out of his mind)
                       Where's Verona!!

          CHEV cocks the gun.
          
                                 ORLANDO
                       I'm talking! What are we talking about?
          
                                 CHEV

                       down ...

          There's BANGING on the door.    A BIKER yells from outside.
          
                                 BIKER (O.S.)
                       O-land-o! What's up!

                           (calling back)
                       There's a white man with a gun in here, I
                       would prefer that he not cap my ass, so
                       please refrain from any sudden ass
                       bullshit!

                             to CHEV)

                       here.
          
           HEV starts to chill out.

                     he is, but you're going to tell me where
                     he is, or I'm going to BLOW YOUR BRAINS
                     INTO THAT TOILET!!
          
          The DOOR BUSTS OPEN and a half dozen gun wielding BROTHERS
          crowd into the tiny room.
          
           otal mad chaos ensues, CHEV, ORLANDO and the BROTHERS packed
          in like sardines, everyone pointing guns at every one else's
          head, shoving each other back and forth, everyone screaming.
          The situation teeters at the very edge of an explosion of
          bloody violence.
          
          Finally ORLANDO cuts through the din with a booming voice.
          
                               ORLANDO
                     THE WHITE MAN IS COOL!   THE WHITE MAN IS
                     COOL!
          S
           ILENCE - just the sound of CHEV'S heartbeat, pumping.
          
                               ORLANDO (CONT'D)
                         (calmly)
                     Can we all just get along?   Can we?
          
          Beat.   CHEV'S gun is still trained on ORLANDO'S head.
          
                               ORLANDO (CONT'D)
                     Now Chevy here has something he would
                     like to discuss. So we are going to
                     discuss it. In a civilized manner.
                     Chevy? I believe you had a question, or
                     some point you were trying to make?
          
                               CHEV
                     Where's Verona.
          
                              ORLANDO
                     OK. I am not affiliated with Ricky
                     Verona.
          
                               CHEV
                         (starting to lose it again)
                     You pulled the Anselmo job together,
                     don't try to bullshit me ...
          
          He presses closer to ORLANDO ... the BROTHERS bristle ... the
          situation is close to blowing up again.

                    Easy ... easy ... now things are
                    beginning to clarify ... you see how that
                    works? How discussion can lead to
                    clarity?
          
           HEV is running out of patience.
          
                              ORLANDO (CONT'D)
                    Clearly you are operating under a false
                    pretense. Ricky Verona and myself did
                    not "pull the Anselmo job together." In
                    fact, Ricky Verona fucked me on the
                    Anselmo job. In fact, Ricky Verona owes
                    me seventy five hunna dollars.
          
                              CHEV
                    That's not how I heard it.
          
                              ORLANDO
                    But that's the way it is. That's the way
                    it is. So you see, I don't know where
                    Ricky Verona is. Because if I knew where
                    he is, I would probably be there right
                    now, beating his Gucci ass down.
          S
           tandoff. CHEV holds the gun with an unsteady hand, studying
          ORLANDO'S eyes, evaluating.
          
           hen, as much from exhaustion as from a sense that he's
          telling the truth, he lets his gun hand drop.
          
                               CHEV
                    Alright.
          
          The room lets out a collective exhale. The BROTHERS mutter
          amongst themselves - damn right you better put that shit
          away, crazy bitch ass mother ...
          
                              ORLANDO
                    Thank you. That's what I'm talking
                    about. That resembles civility.
          
          LUB DUB ... LUB DUB ... LUB ... DUB
          
          CHEV begins to fade again. He slumps back, looking as though
          he might pass out. One of the BROTHERS catches him, holds
          him up and shoves him away.
          
                              ORLANDO (CONT'D)

                              ORLANDO
                    I understand that. You've made that
                    point abundantly clear to all of us.
          
          He takes pity on him - CHEV really looks like shit. A few of
          the BROTHERS lose interest, begin to filter out of the room.
          
                              ORLANDO (CONT'D)
                    Now what can I do to help you?
          
                              CHEV
                    Look, just give me some coke, OK?    You
                    got any coke?
          
          ORLANDO gives him the look.

                    OK, now you're insulting me.

                    that it?
          
                              CHEV
                    Come on, I don't have time for this, just
                    give me something ... I'm really dying
                    here ...
          
                              ORLANDO
                    I can see that.
          
                              CHEV
                    No. You don't understand, I'm really
                    fucking dying ... if I don't ...
                        (losing it again)
                    May I just have some coke, please?
          
                              ORLANDO
                    So this is medicinal use coke, that's
                    what you're telling me.
          
                              CHEV
                    That's right.
          
          Beat.

                    W

                              ORLANDO
                    You got something for me, or what?
          
          CHEV shoves his gun into his belt, pulls out a wad of tens,
          tosses it into the sink. He's visibly fading.
          
          ORLANDO takes a quick look over the wad, pulls a little
          plastic bag out of his vest pocket, tosses it to CHEV. The
          bag hits CHEV square in the forehead, hits sweat and STICKS.
          CHEV reaches for it lamely - it slides off and lands on the
          floor. His reflexes are not the best at this point.
          
          CHEV collapses to his knees, breaks it open and snorts it
          right out of the bag like a pig on his elbows and knees. The
          BROTHERS find this hilarious.
          
          ORLANDO shakes his head in disgust.
          
                              ORLANDO (CONT'D)
                    Chevy ... come on, man...
          
          We hear CHEV'S heart rate start to build, increase in volume.
          
          Suddenly he pops up to his feet, almost slips and falls,
          steadies himself. A new man.
          
                              CHEV
                    OK, that's good.    That's good.
          
                               RLANDO
                    Oh that's good, right?
          
          CHEV pounds rhythmically on chest, keeping time with his
          beating heart.

                         What?
          
               CHEV turns to the biggest, meanest looking BROTHER in the
               room, pats him on the chest in a mock friendly way, then,
               without warning, slams his head forward into the BROTHER'S
               face, knocking him backwards into the hallway, sending all
               the other BROTHERS sprawling like tenpins.

               CHEV has a pool cue in his hands.   He moves out into the
               hallway, eyes wild.
          
                OUND: CHEV's HEARTBEAT starts to rev up.
          
                                   CHEV
                         Alright ... who wants white meat?
          
               All hell breaks loose.

               A calm exterior of the building: single window, bars over it,
               single door closed.
          
               SUDDENLY THE WINDOW SMASHES OUTWARD; the two arms of one of
               the BROTHERS poke out through the bars as though he's been
               thrown into the window frame from inside. One hand holds a
               cue ball, which drops and hits the sidewalk.
          
               A second later THE DOOR BLOWS OFF IT'S HINGES as CHEV is
               tossed, upside down, through it to land on the cement in a
               jumble of glass and wood. The door falls on him. The
               BROTHERS chase him out into the street, shouting him down.
          
               STILL BRANDISHING THE POOL CUE, HE SOMEHOW HOLDS THEM OFF AS 22
          22
               HE STUMBLES TO HIS CAR, PEELS OUT AND BLASTS OFF DOWN THE
               STREET, LAUGHING MANIACALLY, HEART POUNDING LIKE A
               JACKHAMMER.

                          finds out what you did? Your whole crew
                          is history.

                Throughout the conversation his driving has gotten faster, 23B
          23B
                more and more out of control. Now a SQUAD CAR has pulled up
                behind him, cherry top flashing, broadcasting a warning to
                "PULL OVER" out of its intercom.

               occurring outside the car comes from CHEV'S wild steering,
               the sound of BURNING RUBBER AND SIRENS, and the few details
               flashing by in the background and reflected in the glass.

                The CABBIE turns to an FM country station playing Billy Ray

                The Cabbie BLARES it.
          
                CHEV starts to embarrassingly bang his head to the Billy Ray
                as if it was Metallica in the late 80's.
          
                Something catches his eye.

                CHEV jumps out of the cab and into the 7-11.         We see him pull

                He goes right to the counter and sticks the place up.
          
                He grabs the man from behind the counter and in one move,
                yanks him over the counter and SLAMS HIM FACE-DOWN on the
                floor.

               CHEV grabs a box of trash bags, rips it open and takes one
               out. He opens the bag and starts dumping CAFFEINE in: Jolt,

               He yells and jumps up and down while heading to the counter.
               He grabs hundreds of the little ginseng capsules, Vivran, and
               everything candy. The bag's full.

               EXTREME CU of a Fuente Fuente Opus X cigar, rich tendril of

               As the hand holding the cigar brings it up for a drag the
               CAMERA pulls back, revealing CARLITO, an imposing 6'1", 225
               lb. DOMINICAN in his late 40s.
          
               The CAMERA continues its move back, skimming over blue water,
               revealing an elaborate pool area on the rooftop. CARLITO is
               sitting by the pool in a velvet robe.

          Bodyguards roam the property and a beautiful, rock hard BLACK
          WOMAN suns on the deck.
          
          Still in the same shot, pulling back, CARLITO puts down the
          cigar, stands up and dives into the pool. The camera drops
          down below the water level, and CARLITO swims right up to it
          for a CLOSE-UP.
          
          CARLITO'S POV - We are under water swimming towards the edge
          of the pool. As we look up, we see a water-distorted figure
          above the water, looking down into the pool. The classic
          shot made famous in The GRADUATE and used a thousand times
          since ... only this time the guy outside the pool JUMPS IN.
          I
           t's CHEV, fully dressed. He meets CARLITO face to face
          underwater and points up with his index finger.
          
          We CUT TO CARLITO'S reaction.       He follows CHEV up.
          
           heir heads rise just above the water, like heads on a
          platter. Several jittery BODYGUARDS stand at the edge of the
          pool, guns drawn. With a simple motion of his hand, CARLITO
          calms them.

                                  CARLITO

                    than we anticipated.
          
                              CHEV
                    Oh. That's outstanding, Carlito. I'm glad
                    to know that my death can be of some use
                    to you.
          
                              CARLITO
                    Don't be difficult.
          
                              CHEV
                    Am I being difficult? Is this what you
                    call difficult? I don't know if you
                    noticed, but I'm having a DIFFICULT
                    FUCKING DAY, BRO!

               CHEV climbs out of the pool. CARLITO NARROWS HIS EYES,
               watching him leave. The BODYGUARD motions to follow, CARLITO
               signals him off. CHEV passes a black HELICOPTER sitting on a
               small, hard-rubbered heli-pad.
          
               CARLITO'S POV - from a distance we see CHEV knocking over
               furniture and BREAKING GLASS on his way out.
          
               CARLITO'S POV descends beneath the water - his breath
               releases.

               The building opens onto the high rent section of Sunset Blvd.
               An outdoor cafe populated by the rich and trendy is next

                HEV shakes himself off and bangs out of the revolving glass
               doors. A VALET approaches him and CHEV gets in his face,
               FLASHING MURDEROUS TEETH and shoving him away, hopping up and
               down to keep the heart pounding ... he heads over to the cab
               waiting out front.
          
               The same ARAB CABBIE is waiting inside.
          
                                   CABBIE
                         You're not getting into my cab wet.
          
                                   CHEV
                         I just gave you 200 dollars to wait for 3
                         minutes.
          
                                   CABBIE
                         You are not getting into my car no way.
          
               CHEV goes to the driver side of the car, pulls the CABBIE out
               of the cab and tosses him into the road. The lunch crowd at
               the cafe, passerbys, etc., look on in bewilderment. CHEV
               points at the CABBIE and starts screaming ...
          
                                     HEV
                         AL QEADA!   AL QEADA!
          
               Everybody freaks out. A WAITER dives under the a table,
               expecting an explosion.
          
               CHEV grabs the CABBIE by his lapels and tosses him right into
               the CAFE, smashing a table, still pointing and screaming.
          
                                                                   (CONTINUED)

                             Yeah.    I was just down here getting a
                             taco.    He went right in, like, 2 minutes

               KAYLO pays for his food at a leisurely pace - he's at a
               little place across the street from CHARLIE O'S - and skulks
               out onto the street, trying too hard to be inconspicuous.

               Meanwhile, in the second screen, CHEV is blasting along at
               high speed, off the freeway, through downtown, and right to
               the corner of 3rd and Flower, where he leaves the taxi idling
               in a red zone and gets out.

               CHEV, still drying, hair all fucked up and walking
               erratically, enters the restaurant. Everyone turns to look
               at the crazy man, nervously.
          
                HEV walks doggedly right by ALEX, staring straight ahead,
               not letting on that he knows he's there. ALEX watches him

               CHEV disappears through the swinging doors to the kitchen.
               The MAIRTRE'D has the phone in his hands, ready to dial the
               cops, but ALEX motions to him to chill. He'll take care of
               it.

               ALEX enters the kitchen. The COOKS all hustle by him - they
               want no part of this. CHEV is nowhere to be seen.
               A
                LEX continues through the kitchen with a distinct lack of
               caution - everyone's been afraid of the big man all his life -
               drawing a gun from inside his coat as he goes.
          
               He passes a butcher block, a hacked up roast, a conspicuous
               BUTCHER KNIFE.
          
               Turning a corner, he notices the back door swinging slowly
               closed. He advances.
          
               The back door opens onto an alley. He comes up to it, brings
               the gun up by his head, shoulders up to the cracked door and
               tries to peer around it into the alley.
          
               Just then, behind him, CHEV emerges from the kitchen with the
               BUTCHER KNIFE.
          
                efore ALEX can react, CHEV lets swing with the knife and
               neatly cuts off ALEX'S gun hand at the wrist. The hand, gun
               and all, hits the ground. CHEV kicks ALEX out the door and
               into the alley.

               ALEX crumples in shock, holding his abbreviated arm out in
               front of his face. He tries to talk, or scream, but all that
               comes out is a wheezing sound. CHEV follows him out into the
               alley, brandishing the BUTCHER KNIFE, heartrate slamming.

          himself at CHEV. HE SMASHES CHEV INTO THE ALLEY WALL and
          lands on him with his full weight.
          
          CHEV is pinned. ALEX, enraged, attempts with some success to
          strangle him with his remaining hand. CHEV struggles in
          futility, heart hammering. It seems hopeless ...

          brings it down on his skull with a LOUD CRACK.

          the ROLLING PIN and cowers amidst the trash cans.
          
          CHEV gets to his feet, pulls out his gun, puts it to the back
          of ALEX'S head.

          restaurant as ALEX proceeds to beat KAYLO down with a
          trashcan, swinging it one handed.
          
           HEV picks up ALEX'S disconnected hand, which is still
          clutching the gun, and walks back over to the action. He
          uses ALEX'S finger to pull the trigger twice and blows him
          away. ALEX hits the ground with a THUD.

               tossing the empty bottles, eyes watering.

               T
                he COPS turn the corner.        CHEV is still trying to play it
               off.
          
                                          COP (CONT'D)
                            Hey.   You.
          
               Finally CHEV breaks into a run and the COPS give chase.

               CHEV busts into the stairwell and starts heading down. He's
               been holding his gun awkwardly in his armpit; now he whips it
               out. A few flights above he hears the door bang open as the
               COPS pick up the chase.
          
               He exits into the ...
          
               INT EMERGENCY ROOM, MOMENTS LATER

               The busy ER is buzzing with activity. CHEV looks around
               desperately. The COPS are right on his tail.
          
               Suddenly the entrance doors BURST OPEN ... a patient is
               wheeled in at a dead run by a small group of emergency TECHS,
               all shouting instructions back and forth and barking at
               people to get out of the way as they race toward the far
               corridor. The FAT MAN on the gurney has his shirt open ...
               he's pale, glassy eyed and lathered in sweat ... they have
               the DEFIBRILLATOR PADDLES out ...
               B
                ehind the gurney a RESIDENT pushes a CRASH CART along with
               them ... the crash cart houses the DEFIBRILLATOR and various
               supplies ...
          
               CHEV takes off after them, BOWLING PEOPLE OVER, flashing the
               gun.

          The COPS bang open the stairwell door, guns drawn.        Chaos
          breaks out.
          
                                 COP
                       Hold it right there, bro!
          
          The group is galloping      down the long corridor toward the
          elevators that connect      to the O.R. ... three DOCS, the
          RESIDENT, CHEV and the      FAT MAN on the gurney ... the COPS in
          hot pursuit, trying to      get a bead on CHEV.
          
          CHEV is holding his gun to the RESIDENT'S head while pushing
          him and the cart forward. The RESIDENT blubbers in panic.
          The DOCS, in all the confusion, haven't noticed CHEV yet.
          
                                 CHEV
                       You've got epinephrine on this cart!    I
                       want that shit!

                       He's dropping! Stand by to defibrillate!
          
          The gurney slows down and the cart, shoved forward by CHEV,
          crashes into it. Bodies fly, shit spills everywhere. The
          FAT MAN lets out a groan, makes EYE CONTACT with CHEV.
          
                                    FAT MAN

                       Yeah, yeah.
          
          CHEV spins around wildly and FIRES A FEW SHOTS over the COPS
          heads. They hit the deck.
          
                                 TECH 2

                       you're doing? THIS IS A HOSPITAL!
          
           HEV shoves the gun in his face.
          
                                    CHEV

          CHEV brandishes the gun toward the COPS to keep them on the
          ground, then motions C the RESIDENT.
                               to
          
                                HEV (CONT'D)
                    You.   Get me some ... I need ...
          
          CHEV is pale as a ghost ... his legs buckle ... he steadies
          himself against the wall.
          
                              RESIDENT
                        (haltingly)
                    You wanted ... epinephrine, is that
                    right?
          
          CHEV nods weakly. The RESIDENT, on his hands and knees,
          starts digging through the supplies spilled all over the
          floor. The COPS, sensing weakness, start to tense. CHEV
          snaps out of it momentarily.
          
                              CHEV
                    DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!
          
          The RESIDENT approaches him cautiously, on his knees, holding
          out a handful of small white boxes.
          
                              CHEV (CONT'D)
                    Give me that.
          
          He snatches them, cradling them against his stomach, and
          backs up past the DOCS toward the elevator just as the chime
          sounds and the doors slide open. He tosses the boxes inside.
          The FAT MAN lets out another agonized groan.
          
                               AT MAN
                    ... asshole...
          
          CHEV points the gun at him.
          
                              CHEV
                    Not going to tell you again.
          
          He grabs a DEFIBRILLATOR paddle out of TECH 2's trembling
          hands and holds it to his chest.
          
                              CHEV (CONT'D)

                         you?
          
               The RESIDENT flips a switch on the crash cart and the thing
               begins to charge ... CHEV holds the paddle to his chest with
               one hand, the gun out with the other ... finally ...
          
               ZAPPP!!!! CHEV flies backwards, bouncing off the wall like a
               pinball. The COPS leap forward, trying to take advantage,
               but CHEV pops back up, wired and wild eyed.

               He FIRES ANOTHER WARNING SHOT into the ceiling and leaps into
               the elevator as the doors close behind him.

               CHEV collapses on the floor of the elevator. He fumbles with
               the white boxes the RESIDENT handed him and comes up with a
                                    C

               He rubs his arm, feeling for a nice vein, squirts a few drops
               from the tip of the needle and pops the thing right in ...
               pushes the plunger ALL THE WAY, plucks it out and tosses it
               in the corner.
          
               CHEV sits patiently against the wall, staring blankly
               straight ahead. Suddenly a curious look comes over him.
          
                                   CHEV (CONT'D)
                         How much of this stuff did he say to
                         take?

               Suddenly he jumps straight up in the air.

                then looks down: CHEV's hospital johnnie is sticking straight
                out in front, ass hanging out the back, a gun in his left

               CAR HORNS BLARE as motorists attempt to warn the COP, who
               flinches and whips around at the noise - but it's too late:
               CHEV has the gun.
          
               He begins to hop around maniacally, taunting the COP, as
               everyone panics and tries to reverse out of the traffic
               snarl, SLAMMING INTO FENDERS, driving up onto the sidewalk,

                he COP jumps off the bike and tries to make a go at him, but
               jerks back when CHEV catches the gun. CHEV holds the gun up
               like a fetch stick, gluing the COP'S eyes, then flings it 40
               feet through the air to splash into a plaza fountain.
          
                he COP starts after it, then stops short as he sees CHEV
               dart past him and hop onto his still idling motorcycle. He
               kicks up the stand and REVS IT.

               The COP makes a dive for CHEV, grabbing him by the waist as
               the bike jerks forward.
          
                HEV starts to burn the bike out as the COP hangs on,
               dragging. SMOKE ERUPTS; black bits of rubber spray like
               buckshot, pelting the COP. CHEV does a 360 DEGREE BURNOUT,
               kicking with his leg to keep the bike under control, then
               jerking, skidding, BLASTS OFF. The COP hangs on, cursing,
               dragging, boots smoking, for a half block before he bails
               out.

               EVE'S pad is nothing like CHEV'S. It's all cats and incense,
               warm natural light, a scratchy Van Morrison LP playing on a
               real record player.
          
                VE, in a cotton nightgown, is in the kitchen, attempting
               some bit of microwave programming, punching random buttons

               Five BANGS on the door barely distract her.

               sleeve jacket, warm up pants with buttons down the side, the
               works. He couldn't look more out of place in EVE'S mellow
               apartment. He's bathed in sweat, wild-eyed, hair slicked
               back like GORDON GEKKO.

          He pulls her toward him and kisses her. She accepts the kiss
          gratefully enough with her mouth, but holds both hands out to
          her sides as if touching the JOGGING SUIT would kill her.
          
          Without making eye contact, he breaks away and pushes into
          the apartment, looking around everywhere, paranoid.
          
                                 EVE

          He checks into the bedroom, satisfies himself that it's
          empty.

                    OK.
          
          Confused, she pads off to the bedroom to change.
          
          CHEV goes into the kitchen. He peeks out the kitchen window,
          looks around nervously, glances at the microwave, walks up
          and punches two buttons.
          
          EXTREME CU: in ULTRA SLO-MOTION the digital readout on the
          clock switches from 11 to NOON with a sound like an 18-
          wheeler being dragged on it's side through a cathedral.
          
           HEV'S vision starts to blur. He slumps forward, head
          pressed against the microwave, trying to hold himself up.

                    That shit's wearing off ...
          
                               EVE (O.S.)
                        (calling to him)
                    Oh darn! I forgot, the waffle iron's on
                    if you want to make one.
          
                              CHEV
                        (calling back)
                    Great, great ...
          
          He lurches over to the other side of the kitchen ... where an
          old fashioned-style waffle iron sits, plugged in and starting
          to smoke.
          
          He takes a deep breath, opens the lid, PUTS HIS HAND IN AND
          PRESSES THE THING CLOSED.
          
           OUND: a stomach churning SEAR AND SIZZLE.
          
           e screams under his breath, stomping on the kitchen floor in
          agony ... but his HEARTBEAT rockets up again. He pulls out
          his pink, smoking hand and jams it under his armpit, hopping
          up and down.
          
                              EVE (O.S.)
                    You're so stressed out, do you want some
                    pot?
          
                              CHEV
                        (fighting to get the words out)
                    Yes. No! ... thanks ...
          
          The waffle iron starts to SPARK from the plug. He yanks it
          out of the wall as EVE walks in wearing a sun dress and a
          ribbon in her hair.
          
                              EVE
                    What's the matter?

          She comes up to him, tries to pry his hand out from under his
          arm.                 E

               She turns, grabs her purse and walks out the front door in a
               huff.
          
                HEV is about to follow her when he notices something out the
               window - DOUBLE TAKES, then parts the blinds to get a better
               look.
          
          
          
               A SEDAN has pulled up outside. TWO HOODS hop out and split

               up, one coming up the front way, the other around back. Each
               one has a right hand tucked into his blazer - they're
               PACKING.

               He flies out the door after EVE - the door swings shut behind
               him.

               CHEV comes up behind EVE, grabs her by the shoulders and
               turns her around.

               he sees HOOD #1 coming up the front steps.
          
               EVE stops suddenly in front of her door - CHEV practically
               PILES into her.
          
                                      EVE
                            Oh darn... the thing.
          
               She starts to dig through her purse for her keys.

                            The thing.     What thing.
          
               The HOOD tries the front door - LOCKED.

                            off.
          
                he opens the door and walks in. CHEV tries to speak, coughs
               up some unintelligible stacato nonsense.

               CHEV is SLACK-JAWED. Inside the apartment, the PHONE BEGINS
               TO RING.

               Flustered, EVE picks up the phone.

               The door SLAMS OPEN. The HOOD whirls to see CHEV, grim as a

               gun -
          
                OO LATE. CHEV'S hand flashes forward, PALM connecting with
               the BRIDGE OF THE NOSE - dropping him instantly.

               blood rushing from his nose. CHEV glances quickly around for

                                      EVE
                            You know, I could use a little help here.
          
               CHEV shoves the HOOD'S body into a dumpster just as EVE
               turns... CHEV snatches up the first thing he sees - a grime
               encrusted plastic SHOWER CAP - and holds it up lamely.

               The voyeuristic CAMERA picks CHEV and EVE up through the
               crowd. CHEV is wearing DARK GLASSES to go with his 80's hair

               CHEV sits across from EVE in a tiny restaurant. An equally
               tiny VIETNAMESE WOMAN brings them menus.
          
               CHEV pulls a little bottle of NAS-ALL out of his pocket and
               SNORTS the entire thing, grotesquely, at the table. It
               doesn't help much.
          
               He shakes out his head, bangs his fist on the table and sits

          CHEV'S DIALOG continues over the FLASHBACK.
          
          CHEV is retrieving a HIDDEN GUN from the kitchen, checking
          the CLIP, the BARREL, the ACTION, and slipping out a side
          door into a RED CORRIDOR past two CHINESE MEN in black suits.

                       Last night was a job like a hundred
                       others. A high dollar hit. Nothing
                       special.
          
          CHEV walks up behind him, gun drawn to the back of KIM'S
          head... cocks the hammer back. DON KIM spins around in shock,
          the same reaction we saw in the SCENE 1 FLASHBACK - FROZEN,
          SAUCER-EYED.
          
           HEV'S eyes steel... his finger tightens...

                       And then out of nowhere this insane idea
                       comes in through the back of my head like
                       a .45 slug at close range...
          S
           ilence hangs heavy in the room... CHEV holds the gun to DON
          KIM'S head, paralyzed with indecision.

          starting to disperse as lunch hour dwindles. The world

          She SLUGS HIM IN THE MOUTH.    His head snaps back; he comes up
          holding his lip.

           hey roll around on the ground, scratching and clawing at one
          another. A curious crowd gathers round. EVE starts to flip
          out, SCREAMING AND POUNDING on him with her fists like a
          crazy woman.
          
           ext thing you know she's kissing and biting his mouth,

          positions himself on top of her. EVE is completely out of
          her head, eyes closed, legs up in the air like a porn star.

          With a surge of energy he lifts her off the ground, drags her
          over to a newspaper machine on the street - the crowd parts
          to let them through - and bends her over it.
          
          He tries again to enter her.

          He starts to SPANK her. She responds with a moan. A certain
          portion of the crowd spontaneously breaks into applause.
          CHEV picks up the pace. EVE begins making primal cries.
          
            busload of JAPANESE GIRLS pulls up - tourists in matching
          red uniforms - gaping out the window with slack jawed
          amazement.
          
           ith the crowd cheering and traffic stopped, CHEV gets a shot
          of adrenaline and goes for broke. EVE shrieks like a banshee
          as he enters her.

          making full eye contact with the busload of tourists the

                looking straight up as a bag is thrown over KAYLO'S head and
                two unidentifiable men close in on him, lifting the chair off
                the ground ... then takes its time moving slowly down to
                reveal KAYLO'S feet, bicycling wildly, then twitching,
                finally just dangling ... both in fishnet and high heeled
                pumps. One pump falls to the concrete as KAYLO goes still

          The HAITIAN CABBIE opens up his glove compartment and takes
          something out. CHEV'S eyes widen. A gun?
          
                                 HAITIAN CABBIE (CONT'D)

          The CABBIE'S face is painted like a PSYCHEDELIC VOODOO SKULL
          in GLOWING BLACK LIGHT PAINT. He is grinning crazily.
          
          CHEV flinches in horror, but just like that the CABBIE is
          back to normal. He hands CHEV a vial of liquid.
          
                                 HAITIAN CABBIE (CONT'D)

                       like, crackhead. That's the power. Now
                       look at you.
          
           HEV narrows his eyes at the CABBIE, then shakes his head.

                CHEV comes up on a loading platform. Korean workers are
                loading boxes out of the building into the backs of trucks in
                the sweltering heat.
          
                He walks by them into the building without making eye contact
                with anyone. They barely notice.

                freight elevator, gets on, starts up.

                The front and ceiling of the ELEVATOR are open, exposing the
                shaft, the cables and the passing floors; he reaches the 4TH

                machines, all running at once, a mind numbing din ... windows

                of light slicing through ... slow turning ceiling fans and
                long rows of fluorescent light beating down on the tables ...

                THE CAMERA follows CHEV through the room, along the humming
                rows of sewing machines. He crosses from one side of the
                room to another, where a single open window leading out to
                the fire escape streams sunlight. A SUPERVISOR, Korean,
                skinny, mid-thirties, stringy mustache, is dozed off in a
                chair by the window.
          
                CHEV walks right by, out the window and onto the fire escape.

                CHEV ducks behind a big ventilation duct. HOOD #2, mid 40's,
                stocky, is leaning over the edge of the building on the
                opposite side, looking for something - presumably CHEV -
                holding a cell phone up to his ear. His folded jacket and
                gun sit on the ledge beside him.
          
                We recognize the HOOD from CARLITO'S place; he was one of the
                men loitering around the pool.
          
                CHEV sneaks up.
          
                                    HOOD #2
                          How the hell should I know? He went in
                          where they load the boxes. Alright,
                          alright ...
                H
                 e clicks off - and CHEV is on him, snatching up the HOOD'S
                gun, spinning him around and poking it into the soft flesh
                under his chin.

                In one quick motion he grabs ahold of one of the HOOD'S legs,
                hoists him up over the ledge and TIPS HIM OFF THE SIDE OF THE

                The 5TH FLOOR is a little used storage level - stacked boxes,
                dusty file cabinets, garbage everywhere ... starkly lit with
                harsh overhead fixtures as old as the building itself. We

                 HAOS BREAKS OUT as the others dive for cover and start
                blasting. CHEV yanks KAYLO'S chair up and shoves it toward
                the HOODS - then makes a break for the elevator shaft,
                grabbing EVE as he goes.
          
                 AYLO'S body screens CHEV and EVE as they run, taking hits,
                finally toppling over again. CHEV takes out another HOOD on
                the run, nailing him right between the eyes.
          
                 HEV turns his back on the hoods, covering EVE, as they make
                a dive into the open elevator shaft and takes a BULLET IN THE
                ASS.
          
                                    CHEV
                          OW!
          
                He spins and empties his clip at the HOODS, who hit the deck.
          
                EVE holds his ass as CHEV looks down the open elevator shaft.
                The elevator is half a floor down, moving slow. He grabs
                EVE, then the cable... they jump for it.

                CHEV and EVE hit the floor of the moving elevator with a
                CRASH and roll out onto the 4th floor. The workers are all
                in a panic, standing by their sewing machines - they've
                obviously heard the shots. The SUPERVISOR is walking around,
                shoving them back into their seats, screaming at everyone in
                Korean to keep working.
          
                                                                  (CONTINUED)

                The SUPERVISOR, all of five feet, walks right up to CHEV and
                EVE, and starts screaming at them in broken English.

                EVE completely FLIPS OUT and starts SHOUTING DOWN the little
                man.
          
                                       EVE

                             Nice.
          
                The door on the far end of the room BUSTS OPEN and HOODS pour
                in from the stairwell. They spot him.
          
                CHEV and EVE duck low and start hoofing it down the rows of
                machines toward the windows. The HOODS fan out. They play
                cat and mouse in the maze of sewing machines and Koreans
                while the SUPERVISOR, oblivious, continues screaming and
                forcing the workers back into their chairs.
          
                CHEV puts a finger to EVE'S lips, calming her momentarily...
          
                ... then comes up behind a youngish HOOD and shoves the
                HOOD'S gun hand under a vicious looking sewing machine at
                least fifty years old, operated by a Korean woman even older.
                THE RUSTY THING PUNCTURES HIS HAND OVER AND OVER AS HE
                SCREAMS, JUMPING UP AND DOWN, UNABLE TO GET FREE.
          
                 HEV grabs the gun. They make for the fire escape.

                They reach the bottom of the ladder and are PINNED DOWN by
                gunfire from above.
          
                CHEV gives her a LOOK that says it all.
          
                                       EVE
                             I had to see if you were telling the
                             truth... oh, and you have my purse.
          
                CHEV notices the purse still over his shoulder, takes it off
                and hands it to her. With a quick upward glance he breaks
                cover and squeezes off 4 SHOTS, nailing two HOODS on the fire
                escape.
          
                                       CHEV

          spot she would've been -
          
                                 CHEV (CONT'D)
                       ... OK, now come on.
          
          EVE is pale as a sheet. She steps over the body like she was
          avoiding a particularly large pile of cow shit... CHEV grabs
          her hand and yanks her along.
          
          He spots EVE'S CAR parked BACKWARDS across the street and
          they make a desperate RUN FOR IT as more shots WHIZ AND
          RICOCHET off the pavement.
          
          EVE is rifling through her purse as they run. Naturally CHEV
          assumes she's looking for the CAR KEYS.
          
                                 EVE

                       control pill.
          
          CHEV answers the gunfire with shots of his own, buying them a
          few seconds, then grabs the purse and shakes the contents out
          onto the ground.

          She looks like she's about to wander around, gathering up her
          things, when another volley of shots BLOWS OUT THE PASSENGER
          WINDOW of the car.
          
          CHEV picks EVE up like a sack of grain and THROWS HER, HEAD
          FIRST, THROUGH THE PASSENGER WINDOW, INTO THE CAR, then runs
          around the other side, hops in and PEELS OUT.

          CHEV'S eyes flash to the rearview mirror and GO WIDE. He
          grabs the back of EVE'S head and PUSHES IT DOWN INTO HIS LAP -
          just as a BULLET SLICES THROUGH THE REAR WINDSHIELD and out
          the front.

          He SLAMS THE BRAKES to put the car into a SLIDE, exposing his
          driver side to the pursuing sedan - punches his gun hand out
          the window and BLASTS AWAY.
          
          He NAILS THE DRIVER BETWEEN THE EYES... the window
          DISINTEGRATES... The SEDAN full of HOODS skids into the

                    Are they... OK?
          
          CHEV looks at her like she's nuts.
          
                              CHEV
                    They're dead.
          
          EVE is overwhelmed.
          
                              EVE
                    How can you... how can you do that...?
          
          CHEV barely hears her - he's become DISTRACTED, flexing his
          left hand and feeling around his legs.
          
                              CHEV
                    I told you, baby... I quit.
          
          He spots something, hits the brakes.

                CHEV almost COLLAPSES when his feet hit the ground. It seems
                like the left half of his body has simply stopped working.
          
                                    CHEV
                          Jesus Christ! Now what...?
          
                He unsnaps the buttons of the warm-up pants to reveal that
                his left leg has TURNED GREY.
          
                He's HALF DEAD.
          
                                    EVE
                          What's the matter?
          
                                    CHEV

                          Stay.
          
                They've pulled up across the street from a HARDWARE STORE.
                CHEV drags his carcass across the street, oblivious to the
                traffic swerving and braking to avoid him, and stumbles in.
          
                EVE stays in the car for a few seconds, looking lost, then
                pulls herself together and gets out.
          
                She follows CHEV'S path, crossing the street through traffic.
          
                 TORE EMPLOYEES and CUSTOMERS start bailing out of the store
                in a PANIC as she approaches the front doors. She walks

                EVE dream-walks through the store, past the registers,
                following CHEV'S trail of BLOOD-SMEARED FOOTPRINTS.
          
                A pimple-faced STOCK CLERK blows by her, not looking back.

                She turns the corner and there's CHEV - he's propped up in
                the middle of an aisle in front of a bin of NAILS, HAMMER in
                one hand...

                busy POUNDING IN NUMBER SEVEN.

                a red blazer, one of the TOURISTS from the bus, is being
                interviewed in Japanese amidst a crowd of her semi-identical
                friends. A TRANSLATION is overdubbed.

                The GIRLS giggle.

                             Give me a fucking break...
          
                The BROADCAST cuts to a MONTAGE: The trashed restaurant, the
                burning Police motorcycle, the car crashed into the mall
                escalator, POLICE sifting through wreckage, finally the
                sketch of CHEV'S face.

                       interested in a little deal.
          
                                   ERONA
                       A deal?   You're mental, dude.
          
                                 CHEV
                       I want the antidote.
          
                                 VERONA
                       Oh, the antidote, huh?
          
          VERONA makes eye contact with his CREW, covering the
          mouthpiece of the phone; they all try to keep from breaking
          up.
          
                                 CHEV
                       That's right.
          
                                 VERONA
                       And what are you prepared to give me.
                       Asshole.
          
                                 CHEV
                       How about the jewelry I got off your
                       faggot brother, you cocksucker?
          
          This stings VERONA. He pulls the phone away from his face,
          looks at it like he wants to smash it into bits, then pulls
          himself together and puts it back to his ear.

                          an antidote. I can make a deal for it,

                shot that starts the film. The MUSIC is replaced by the
                SOUND of CHEV'S labored BREATHING and HEARTBEAT. The POV
                doubles, goes in and out of focus.
          
                 n one continuous shot he approaches the STANDARD HOTEL and
                walks past the valets into the RETRO-MOD LOBBY.

                The shot continues as CHEV moves through the LOBBY and makes
                a beeline for the RESTROOM. Scattered around are hard
                looking DUDES pretending to read newspapers ... he passes

                The bathroom is empty. He walks into a stall, shuts the door
                and opens his coat - we see a PAGER-SIZED device clipped to
                his belt - a green LED is illuminated.
          
                 EVERSE: CHEV adjusts a tiny knob on the device.   His face is
                shiny with perspiration.
          
                He pulls out his shirt tails ... we see that a small tube
                runs from the device to a needle inserted in the base of
                C
                spine, taped up with white adhesive.
          
                 HEV tucks the shirt back carefully, takes a series of deep
                breaths and leaves the stall.

                He bangs open the door to the restroom and pushes past three
                of the DUDES, who were about to go in. They let him pass,
                trying to avoid attention.
          
                CHEV makes his way to the ELEVATORS, hits the UP button.    The

                Silence.

          CHEV takes a small bottle of PILLS from his coat pocket and
          swallows them dry.
          
          He closes his eyes and leans against the wall to steady
          himself as the effect of the pills washes over him.
          
           n UNEXPECTED VOICE breaks the silence.

                       Where did I go wrong?
          
          CHEV'S eyes SNAP OPEN.    The JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN stares back,
          impassively.

                           (weirded out)
                       Did you say something?
          
          Now the JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN answers - but when he moves his
          lips, it's the voice of A WOMAN IN HER 40s.

                       mother.
          
          CHEV shakes his head in disbelief, tries to clear his eyes,
          but the HALLUCINATION persists.

                       You never call, you never write... I
                       haven't seen you since you ran out at

                       Right, with you popping Valium like Tic
                       Tacs and balling some new asshole every
                       two weeks... why wouldn't I stick around
                       for entertainment like that?
          
                                 KAREN CHELIOS
                       That's hurtful.
          
          CHEV is an instant ball of regret.

          The JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN cuts him off - this time the voice
          is ORLANDO'S.
          
                              ORLANDO

                    This is weird.
          
                              ORLANDO
                    But you know this has got to stop
                    sometime. What do you think you are,
                    Michael Myers? They pop you and you just

           s he speaks, ALEX'S voice transforms again, this time into
          CHEV'S... he's now talking to A MIRROR OF HIMSELF...
          
                              MIRROR CHEV
                    Bipolar. Sadomasochistic tendencies.
                    Adrenaline junkie. Addicted to
                    violence... probably spends every day of
                    his life looking for the big thrill, the
                    big rush. Cutting up a guy like that
                    while he screams in his own blood and
                    excrement would be like... like a GIFT...
                    a warrior's death... hell, you'd probably
                    get off on it...

                              MIRROR CHEV
                    No, this was the best way for a guy like
                    you: a slow, ticking clock... winding
                    down... inevitable... non-negotiable...

                The JAPANESE MAN ignores him. When the doors open, he

                CHEV.

                The GOONS lead CHEV through a posh dining area, down a dark
                corridor.
          
                They frisk him, finding the obvious .45 in the shoulder
                holster, yank it out and push him into a SMOKING LOUNGE.

                CARLITO and RICKY VERONA sit side by side at the table. An

                       something.
          
          The GOONS give him another look. This time they reach down
          his pants and produce a second small, concealed handgun ...
          then discover the pager-like device. One of the goons rips
          the tube from CHEV's back - CHEV winces in pain. His
          HEARTRATE starts to slow almost immediately.

          CHEV nods. CARLITO places the device carefully on the table.

                              CHEV
                        (egging him on)
                    We'll see what kind of a bitch you are
                    when Carlito hires you for half what he
                    used to pay me... and you take it.
          
                              CARLITO
                    That's enough.
          
                              CHEV
                    You'll probably throw boss a nice little
                    reach-around just to show what a good
                    bitch you are.
          
                              VERONA
                    I'm nobody's little bitch, you hear me?
                    He'll pay what I tell him to pay...!
          
                              CARLITO
                    I said that's enough.
                        (calmly)
                    It's been a long day. But in the end, you
                    must agree, it all works out quite
                    nicely. Don Kim gets his bullet, thanks
                    to you...
          
          CARLITO unlatches a 2'x6" beautifully crafted mahogany wood
          case sitting on the table in front of him. It contains
          several SYRINGES and bottle of MILKY FLUID. He removes one
          SYRINGE from the box with a gloved hand. It almost glows in
          the soft light.      C

          CARLITO squirts a little of the MILKY LIQUID.

                    Hold him down.
          
          In a flash, CHEV WHIPS OUT A GUN - everyone FLINCHES... but
          no, wait: he's just holding out his fist, pointing the STICK-
          EM-UP FINGER right between CARLITO'S eyes.
          
                              CHEV
                    Not so fast, motherfucker.
          
          For a beat, no one knows quite how to react. VERONA chuckles
          nervously.
          
                              VERONA
                    Dude's gone dipsy doodle...
          
          CHEV whips the finger toward VERONA, shutting him down mid-
          word. VERONA shrugs it off with less than 100% confidence...
          the room EXHALES.
          
                              VERONA (CONT'D)

                    Chelios.
          
          A GOON makes a move for CHEV... but CHEV spins on him,
          leveling the finger at the GOON'S forehead, and pulls the
          "trigger"...
          
                              CHEV
                        (imitating a gunshot)
                    Booosh!
          
          The GOON'S head is rocked back, a NICKEL-SIZED HOLE popped
          right through the cranium... a GLORIOUS FOUNTAIN OF CRIMSON
          arcs from the GOON'S forehead across the table, splashing
          into the ice bucket.

          DON KIM,   in a Ralph Lauren polo shirt and white slacks, is
          standing   at the entrance of the bar. He's got an ASIAN
          GANGSTER   on each side, one of them holding out a smoking,
          silenced   GLOCK .9mm.
          
          More ASIAN GANGSTERS appear all around, moving in, taking
          position. The GANGSTERS all look about 16 years old, dressed
          for a hot night at the FLORENTINE GARDENS... but their eyes
          are dead-blank COLD AS HELL.
                               V

                                 CHEV
                      Presto.
          
          One of CARLITO'S GOONS points an UZI at DON KIM... and is
          FILLED FULL OF LEAD in the blink of an eye by a pair of
          ASIANS on his blind side... who are CUT TO RIBBONS by another
          of CARLITO'S MEN... and ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.
          
          CARLITO scrambles away from the table and grabs one of his
          GOONS, using him as a shield as he makes his way behind the
          bar... the GOON absorbs a hail of bullets...
          
          VERONA whips out a .357 MAGNUM, turns toward CHEV...
          
           ummoning a surge of strength from out of his ass, CHEV kicks
          the table forward, pinning VERONA'S legs to the bench - the
          ICE BUCKET slides into CHEV'S lap...
          
           e snatches out a bottle of Dom Perignon and fastballs it at
          VERONA'S GUN HAND... the bottle SHATTERS... VERONA bobbles
          the .357... it hits the ground - GOES OFF - and the four
          fingers of VERONA'S right hand are VAPORIZED.
          
          VERONA SHRIEKS like a ten year old girl at a JUSTIN
          TIMBERLAKE concert.
          
          Behind the bar, CARLITO quickly punches up his cell phone.
          
                                CARLITO

          A PILOT is standing by in CARLITO'S personal HELICOPTER,
          waiting on the roof.
          
                                 PILOT
                      Yes sir.
          
          He fires her up, LIFTS OFF...
          
                                                                       99.
          
          
          
          INT SMOKING LOUNGE, STANDARD HOTEL - CONTINUOUS
          
          CARLITO'S and DON KIM'S MEN have backed into opposite corners
          of the room, and are firing back and forth.
          
          VERONA crawls along the floor, gathering up what's left of
          his fingers... comes across a SYRINGE and grabs it in his
          teeth like a PIRATE'S KNIFE.
          
          DON KIM stands amidst the chaos, completely unperturbed.
          
                              CARLITO
                        (from behind the bar)
                    I'll kill you for this, Chelios!
          
                                CHEV
                    Too late!
          
          CHEV swoons, almost passes out... catches sight of a GUN and
          pries it from the hand of a dead GOON... he spots VERONA'S
          FEET disappearing behind a wall, takes a bead and fires -
          blowing off a set of toes to go with the fingers.
          
          An ASIAN GANGSTER runs up and lobs a GRENADE behind the
          BAR... it bounces along and comes to rest next to CARLITO.
          
          CARLITO thinks quick, grabbing one of his GOONS - a 265
          pounder - from behind...
          
                                CARLITO
                    Get down!
          
          He BODY-TACKLES the BIG MAN onto the floor, right on top of
          the live grenade, and brings his weight down on top of him.
          
                              GOON
                    Thanks, boss.
          
          BOOM!
          
          The BIG GOON'S body absorbs the blast, which picks them both
          up five feet in the air... CARLITO, momentarily airborne,
          pops up from behind the bar like a JACK IN THE BOX, then
          drops back down with a THUD...
          
                              CARLITO

          The LOUNGE opens into a daylight drenched POOL AREA...
          CARLITO'S HELICOPTER drops down into view, roiling up the
          water...
          
          CARLITO makes a break for it.

                VERONA grabs the gun out of CHEV'S hand and points it at
                CARLITO.

                He blows CARLITO away with three shots.
          
                The PILOT starts to lift off in a blue panic. VERONA shoves
                CHEV aside and hops into the back seat, pointing his gun at
                the PILOT'S head.

                VERONA whips the gun around as the bird rises, intending to
                .
                finish CHEV off from the air ...
          
                 .. and has the gun removed from his hand by CHEV, who has
                climbed onto the landing skids, hooking his dead arm inside
                the passenger space, going up with them.

                CHEV has VERONA locked up; both men are fighting with just
                one hand ... VERONA manages to work his up to CHEV'S
                shoulder, where the steel needle still pokes through. He
                slides it out and stabs at CHEV'S face ... CHEV catches his
                wrist in time to hold him off, but his grip is slipping ...
          
                The spaces between CHEV'S HEARTBEATS have grown longer and

                Then, with a final rush of adrenaline, he grabs VERONA by the
                neck and pulls him along.
          
                The two men FALL FROM THE HELICOPTER.
