           out and there was so little money and
           time? We took risks, we experimented. We
           invented new ways of making pictures
           because we had to.

           he sees you're suffering, he'll notice
           and he'll take care of you. My mother

           And so, gentle viewer, Psycho -- the
           picture everyone predicted would bring me
           to wrack and ruin -- was such a hit that
           Alma and I got to... Well, let's just say
           that we got to keep our house -- and the
           swimming pool. And the same critics who
           despised it went on to call it one of my
           greatest achievements.
