          FADE IN:
          CLOSE -- KATE COLEMAN (MID 30S )
          She's a simple beauty and very pregnant, propped up in a bed,
          wearing a hospital gown. A heart rate monitor BEEPS. She touches
          her swollen belly, flush with excitement, her eyes full of wonder.

          MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
          Okayp, just relax.now. This'll be over
          Caitti before you know it.
          Kate looks up. Her smile falters-as we REVEAL:

          INT. DELIVERY ROOM - NIGHT

          Harsh lights overhead. -THUNDER rumbles outside. Kate's on a.
          delivery table, legs already in the stirrups. A sheet hangs-  
          across her belly so we can't see what's going on below her waist.
          A DOCTOR and NURSE snap pn gloves, prepare instruments: SHARP
          BLADES and CURETTES, NEEDLES and FORCEPS. Kate is stricken. She
          tries to sit up.

          KATE
          Wait, I've changed my mind. I don't
          want to do this anymore.
          The Doctor gives the Nurse an exasperated look. The Nurse takes
          Rate's hand, eases her back onto the table.

          NURSE
          Your baby is dead. There's nothing.
          else we can do.
          Kate reels, her world turned upside-dowp. Emotional free-fall.

          KATE
          No, this isn't what's supposed to
          happen. My baby's alive!

          NURSE
          We're so sorry. A terrible loss, we're
          so sorry...

          KATE
          But it's still alive! It's moving!
          Feel it, you can feel it!
          Kate tries to put the Nurse's hand on her.belly but the-Nurse-
          pulls away and hands the Doctor a pair of gleaming.blunt-tipped
          SURGICAL SCISSORS. The Doctor leans between Rate's spread legs,
          disappearing behind the curtain. Rate gasps.

          RATE
          No, stop! I want to be asleep! 
          

          

          2.

          -DOCTOR-
          TOO late for anesthesia.'' The baby's
          coming. You're.going to experience
          some pressure now... -
          Kate winces and bites her lip as the Doctor goes about his unseen
          work. A GOOD-LOOKING MAN in surgical scrubs stands behind him..
          Bizarrely, he's videotaping-the whole thing. He's Kate's husband,
          JOHN (late 30's). He smiles at her from behind -the camera.

          JOHN
          It's okay, honeys You're doing great!
          The Doctor hands the scissors, now slick with gore, to the Nurse.
          H e takes a SUCTION. CATHETER and disappears behind-the curtain
          again. The Nurse - presses a button on a vacuum pump and the
          machine begins to HUM. Kate tightly closes her eyes.

          KATE
          This isn't happening. Wake up, wake
          up, wake up...
          Suddenly -- the thin wail of a BABY CRYING. Rate's eyes go wide
          w ith horror as the smiling Nurse approaches with a wriggling
          bundle wrapped in a blanket. Blood seeps through the pink fabric.
          W e can't see what's inside, but it's moving. And it's CRYING.

          NURSE
          Congratulations, Mrs. Coleman. It's a
          girl .
          The Nurse offers her the bloody, blanketed bundle. Kate screams -

          INT. KATE AND JOHN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          -- then snaps awake. She's been having a nightmare. John lies
          n ext to her in bed. Be stirs, but doesn't wake. Kate slips out
          of bed and quickly pads to the bathroom;

          INT. KATE AND JOHN'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Kate closes the door. We now see that she's not pregnant in
          reality, only in her nightmare. She slides to the cold floor in
          t he dark, a hand on her flat belly as she starts to cry...

          INT. DOCTOR BROWNING'S OFFICE - DAY

          Water TRICKLES in a little Zen fountain. Kate sits across from
          -DR. -BROWNING, a mousy-haired woman in her 50's.

          DR. BROWNING
          A lot of women experience difficulties
          around the anniversary of the
          miscarriage or the baby's expected due
          date. It's perfectly normal.

          

          

          

          

          3.

          KATE
          I was thinking of" going back to work.
          I really thought 1 was doing better.

          DR. BROWNING
          You are. Think about where you were
          just four months ago. -
          (off Kate's look)
          Are you still sober?
          Kate hesitates. Dr. Browning gives her a penetrating look.

          KATE
          I drove by the wine shop,on my.way.bome
          the other day.

          DR. BROWNING
          Did you stop?

          KATE
          I really wanted to. The thought went
          through m' head, you know. it wasn't
          for me, it just might be nice to have a
          bottle handy in case we had guests.

          DR. BROWNING.
          But you didn't go in?

          KATE
          No.

          DR. BROWNING
          That's all that matters. Let's try to
          stay focused on the. positive. Grief is
          different for everyone. You have to
          take it at your own pace.. Keep writing
          in your journal. You're doing fine.
          Rate smiles weakly. unconvinced.

          INT. LIVING ROOM -.DAY

          Rate hangs curtains over a beautiful picture window. She steps'
          back to admire her work, then sighs. Now what? Now that she s
          done, the house suddenly seems-quiet and lonely and too big.

          INT. NURSERY - DAY

          Kate sits in a rocking chair, gazing out a distinctive ARCHED
          'WINDOW. We realize that she's -In a fully furnished and decorated

          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          After a short walk, Kate sits by a PEACEFUL BROOK lost in her
          thoughts. ,She pulls a JOURNAL filled. with handwritten entries
          from her coat pocket. After a beat,'she begins to write.

          EXT. SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF - DAY

          Class has just let out, PARENTS arriving to pick up their KIDS.
          But the playground is MOSTLY SILENT -- these children an deaf,
          communicating to one another and their teachers by sign language.
          'Kate pulls up in a luxury minivan. Her five-year-old daughter MAX
          runs over togreet her. She's almost- ridiculously cute.
          (NOTE: Max doesn't speak. Her "dialogue" is SIGNED and
          SUBTITLED. She wears a REARING AID- to help her read lips. when
          people speak to her, they must face her and/or sign.)
          Kate kisses Max's'head and helps her into the van, buckling her
          car seat. Max shows her an art project she's bringing home.

          KATE
          Wow, did you make this?

          MAX

          MY TEACHER HELPED.

          INT./EXT. KATE'S MINIM - DAY

          Kate's' driving. She stops at an intersection. A PREGNANT WOMAN
          crosses the street in front of them and stops at the corner. Kate
          watches her for a long beat as if transfixed...
          In the backseat, Max-CLAPS her hands to get Kate's attention.
          Kate turns and sees Max pointing to the traffic light. IVs
          green. A car horn HONKS. Kate snaps -out of it and drives off.

          INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY

          Kate sits at a baby grand piano,'trying to compose a piece of..
          music. She plays a few NOTES, frowns, tries again, takes a pencil
          and erases what she's written down.
          She pauses to look over-at a beautiful ORCHID in an ornate plants=
          by the window. For a moment, she just stares at it. Then:
          13 1 She's startled by something outside BOUNCING off the side
           of the house. She closes her eyes, frustrated. BANGI EANG1
           BANG! She tries to ignore it, but can't.

          'EXT. COLEMAN RESIDENCE - DAY

          Max is playing basketball in the driveway, but the ball's too big
          for her and the hoop's too.high. Every time she tries to shoot,
          the ball falls short and BANGS against the house.

          

          

          

          

          5.
          Kate opens-the door, angrily signing as she speaks:
          Stop banging that against the house!
          I'm trying-to work!.

          MAX

          SORRY.
          Max gives an abashed look. Kate sighs. She knows she was too
          harsh with her.

          KATE
          -No, I'm sorry.. But just... take a
          break for a little while, okay?
          Max nods. Kate goes. back inside.
          A CAR pulls into the-drive.. It's John and eleven--year-old-DANIEL,
          Rate and John's other child. Daniel's blonde, brash, and-cocky,
          the all-American kid. He's wearing.a Little League uniform.
          Daniel runs toward Max. He steals her ball and dribbles-it around
          her in circles. -Max watches glumly. He offers her the ball, but
          when she reaches for it, he snatches it away and shoots a lay--up..-

          DANIEL
          Boo -yahl He shoots! He scores!

           

          JOHN
          Nice one, champ! -
          Daniel pumps his arm and runs inside. John walks up the drive,
          carrying a bouquet of FLOWERS. He hands Max the ball and lifts
          her up to the basket. Max happily puts the ball-through'the hoop.

          JOHN
          All right! Ginme five!
          She smiles and gives him a high-five as he carries her inside.

          YN'. MUSIC ROOM - DAY -
          Kate has just sat back down at the piano when she hears Daniel
          tear into the house and run upstairs. She slumps her shoulders
          and closes her notebook. No more work today. John enters.

          JOHN
          Drapes look'nice.

          KATE
          Curtains.
          (off his.look)
          They're curtains, not drapes. And haw

          He offers her the flowers..

          JOHN

          MAX

          KATE
          Ore story. Then bedtime. Okay?
          Max nods. happily and picks up a book from her nightstand. Kate
          groans inwardly when she sees what it is. It'.s called. "We were
          Going To Have A Baby, .But We Had An Angel Instead."

          KATE
          You want to hear about the baby again?
          Max nods. Kate hesitates, then gives Max a sad smile.

          INT. MAX'S BEDROOM - HIGHT (TIMECUT)

          Kate sits on Max's bed, reading and showing her the pictures:

          KATE
          "People send us flowers and cards, but
          we still miss our baby. If this just
          happened to you, I'm sorry you got an
          angel instead of a'baby. I.think a
          baby would have been more fun."
          The last picture is a FAMILY WITH A BABY ANGEL watching over them.

          MAX

          IS BABY JESSIE AN ANGEL?

          KATE
          Yes, she is. She's with us every day.

          John watches TV in bed. Kate enters from the bathroom in a
          nightshirt and sits on the bed. She.rubs lotion on her feet.
          John watches her, then reaches out, runs his fingers uup and down
          her back. Kate freezes. He can't see the-nervous look that
          crosses her face. He moves closer, pushes her hair aside, kissing
          hex-. neck. Kate responds stiffly, trying to get. in the mood.
          He slides a hand around her waist, moves it up to her breast...

          KATE
          I'm sorry. I can't. Shit...
          She moves away, tears suddenly in.her eyes. He gives a concerned
          look, lets her have her space. A beat.

            KATE
          I'm so sick of feeling like this.
          Christ, the kids must thing I'm crazy.

          JOHN
          Will you stop worrying about what
          everybody else thinks?

          KATE
          How can I? I saw a pregnant woman
          today on the way home and I almost lost
          it. Just burst into tears with Max
          sitting right there. Daniel barely
          talks to me. You and I haven't had sex
          in over a year now. What if I.never
          get better? I don't want to lose you.

          JOHN
          You're never going to lose us. I
          promise you. I just wish...
          (off her look)
          Have you thought any more about
          adopting?

          KATE
          I can't even be a mother to the
          children we already have.

          JOHN
          That's not true. The kids understand.
          They just know you're not happy.

          KATE  
          But I should be.

          JOHN -
          Do you want another child?

          

          

          

          

          B.

          KATE
          You Snow I do. More than anything.

          JOHN
          Even if it can-'t be'biologically ours.

          KATE-

          YES

          JOHN
          Then what are we talking about this
          -for? Let's do it.

          KATE
          You-don't just adopt a child because
          you're lonely and depressed.

          JOHN
          That's not why we'd be doing..it. We
          wanted a child a year ago and we still
          want one, now..

          KATE
          We can't replace our baby.

          JOHN
          No, 'we can't. But we can take the'
          place we made for her in our hearts and
          our home and give it to a child who
          needs a family.

          (BEAT)
          Kate, we love being parents. We're
          good at it and'it makes. us happy. What
          better reason-do you want?
          Kate looks at him for a beat, then smiles and lets her tears fall.

          Kate smiles. She closes the folder and looks at a Polaroid of a

          The door-opens. Kate and John are led inside by SISTER ABIGAIL,
          an African-American nun in her 50's.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          Yolanda, look who's here to see you.
          Yolanda, smiles at Kate and John.. She runs over to greet them, but
          stands just out of their reach. -Kate kneels in front of her.

          RATE
          Don't you look pretty!

          YOLANDA
          6ister Abigail put ribbons in my hair.
          See?

          KATE
          Wow, that was nice of her. Look, we
          brought you something for the trip
          tomorrow.
          She hands her a bag of activity books and a "Travel Turtle," a kid-
          sized lap desk for coloring in the car_ Yolanda's face lights up.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          What do you.say?

          YOLANDA
          Thank you.
          Kate reaches out to her, but Yolanda pulls-away, focusing all her
          attention on her presents. Rate gives her a sad 'smile.

          IT. HOME FOR GIRLS - PLAYROOM -- DAY (TIMECUT)
          Yolanda is drawing a picture, "Travel Turtle" on her lap. Kate
          and Abigail sit nearby, watching. Kate seems worried. Abigail
          notices. She speaks in a low voice so Yolanda won't hear:

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          Nervous?

          KATE
          Yeah. And happy. And excited. : And
          proud. And scared shitless. It' s
          funny. All the same feelings I had
          when I was pregnant with our others.

          .SISTER ABIGAIL
          That's what really worries you, isn't
          it? Something bad happened, the last
          time you felt this way.
          (off Kate's look)

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          SISTER ABIGAIL .CONT'D)
          Yolanda's doing something similar.
          She's afraid of :getting hurt again,.
          .too. Bit I have a-good feeling'about
          you two. You can help. each other heal.
          And you're lucky. You have a wonderful
          husband who can be there for you both.
           A flicker crosses Rate's eyes at the mention of het "wonderful
           husband." Doubt? uncertainty? Abigail.do'esn't see it.
          I h T. HOME FOR GIRLS - CORRIDOR - DAY
          'John emerges frcaitthe HEN'S ROOM. The walls of the hallway are
          lined -with Children's-artwork. He glances at it as he walks by.
          Suddenly, he stops short. Amidst the crude watercolors and
          _macaroni mosaics are several beautiful ain s, s'% surprisingly
          sophisticated, more Like the works of Henri 'R usseahan the
          o crayon-and-stick-figure scribbles surrounding them.
          Then he hears something: a LITTLE GIRL'S VOICE, softly HUN= G a
          tune. We know the words. When I was juuust a lii.ittle yiiir., I
          asked my mother, what will I be?...

          M. HOM13 OR GIRLS - ART ROOM - DAY
          .John follows the HUMMING to a stark, white room. Light slants in
          from a big-window, shining on A LITTLE GIRL in a lacy white dress.
          Her. back is to us, so.we can't see her face, just curls of
          platinum blonde hair spilling to her shoulders. She sits at an
          easel, all alone, painting another extraordinary picture.
          John watches, curious. Suddenly; she senses his presence. She-
          stops humming, the paintbrush freezes mid-stroke. She turns.
          She looks about eight years old, with pale skin and-bright, doe-
          like eyes, her delicate features framed by Shirley Temple curls.
          It's the face- of a porcelain angel, a perfect little laving doll,
          friendly and inviting. She wears a thick black velvet ribbon
          around her neck and one around each wrist. Her'name is ESTHER.

          JOHN
          Hi there.

           ESTHER
          Hello. -
          She speaks with a strange accent. Sounds Eastern European.

          JOHN
          Are these , paintings all yours?

          ESTH ER
          Yes. Do you like them?

          JOHN
          Very much. They're remarkable. -

          

          

          

          

          12.

          BSS
          h T ank :you. My name is Esther. What's
          yours?

          JOHN
          John. It's nice to meet you.
          She smiles and demurely offers her hand, giggling as he takes it.
          She blushes, then turns back to her painting. It's a half-
          finished jungle scene with a SMILING LION crouched beneath a tree.

          JOHN
          So what's this one going to bo? 

          ESTHER
          My paintings are stories that come from
          my imagination. -This one'-s about a'sad
          mother lion who can't find her cube.

          JOHN
          She's smiling.

          ESTHER
          She's dreaming about her babies. It's
          the only thing that makes her happy.

          JOHN
          Well, I hope she finds them.

          ESTHER
          She will. I,bok.
          As she speaks, Esther dabs her brush and paints little lion cubs
          curled up in front of their sleeping mother:

          ESTHER
          They were lost'in the jungle 'and they
          were so scared because they didn't'have
          a mother or father. But just when they
          thought they'd be alone forever, they
          found their mother sleeping under this
          tree. And they felt so safe that they
          fell asleep too. Now when-the mother
          lion wakes up, her dream will have come
          true. She has her family again.

          JOHN
          Where did you learn how to do this?

          ESTHER
           Y've just had lots of time to practice,
          I guess. It's so boring here.

          JOAN
          You don't play outside with the other
          girls? Sounds like they're having fun.

          

          

          

          

          13.

          ESTHER
          I like staying inside. That way I
          don't get my clothes dirty.

          JOHN
          (amused) -
          Well, that's very responsible of you,
          but I'll- bet the sisters could find
          something else for you. to wear.

          ESTEER
          You.don't like my dress? - Don't you
          think it's pretty? -

          JOHN
          Your dress is. very pretty. I'm ,just
          saying. you could -probably go outside if
          you really wanted to.

          - ESTHER
          (a beat, hesitant)
          I don't like laying with the other
          .girls. I'm different from everyone.

          JOHN
          There's nothing wrong with different.

          ESTHER
          Yes, there is. Everybody says there's
          not, but it isn't true. I don't care.
          If I'm sad or lonely, I just come in
          here a nd paint a story with a happy
          endingg And when people say they like.
          my paintings, it makes me feel better.
          (off his look)
          I think.peo le should always try to
          take the bad things that happen to them
          and turn them into something good.
          Don't you?
          John is taken aback. Who j t1m1s )dc? Before he can respond:

          .- RATE (O.S.)
          There you are.
          Rate and Sister Abigail stand in the doorway. John waves for Kate
          to enter and Esther sits up eagerly when she does. Abigail's
          expression darkens when she sees who John has been talking to.

          JOHN
          Hey, I'd like you to meet someone. -
          (to Esther).
          Esther, this is my wife, Kate.
          Kate smiles and offers her hand, but instead of shaking it, Esther
          lovingly presses it to her cheek.

          

          

          

          

          14. -

          ESTIIR -
          Motta...
          Kate'and John exchange a beumsed look'.

          JOHN
          She painted these all by herself.

          ' RATE
          Wow, you're quite the little-artist.

          ESTHE'R
          Thank you. You smell nice.
          Kate laughs. Sister Abigail shifts uncomfortably.

          ESTHER
          Would you like me to paint you a
          picture? You can watch me if-you want.
          I'm normally a little shy, but --

          SISTER ABIGAIL'
          Esther, I'm sorry, they don't have time
          for you to paint them a picture.
          (off Esther's look)
          They have to come with me now.
          Yolanda's going home with them
          tomorrow. isn't that wonderful?
          Esther wilts. She releases Rate's hand and musters a weak smile.

          ESTHER
          Yes. I'm sure she'll be very happy.

          KATE
          It was nice meeting you.

          ESTHER -
          The pleasure was mine.

          JOHN
          (to Sister Abigail)
          You've got a real talent on your hands
          here.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          Yes, we're very lucky to have her.
          But there's something -strange-in Abigail's voice -- she definitely
          doesn't un -lucky. Esther watches them go.

          INT. HOME FOR GIRLS - ENTRY - DAY

          Sister Abigail walks Kate and John to the front door.

          

          

          

          

          I5.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          The notary will be here at.ten for-you-
          to sign the placement agreement.

          KATE
          Thank you so much for all your help.
          Kate gives her a warm hug. But mid-embrace, she notices
          something: Esther is at the end of the hallway, peering at them
          from around a corner. Abigail and John see--her,' too.

          KATE
          What did she say to me.back there? It
          sounded like... "motta?"

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          It's Russian. It means "mother."
          INT.JoHN'S CAR - NIGHT
          John whistles "Whatever Will Be, Will Be" to himself as he drives.
          Kate gives him an amused look, then Jokingly sings along:

          KATE -
          When you were juuust a liuittle

          JOHN
          Sorry, I've got that stuck in my head
          now.

          KATE
          She. made quite an impression on.you.

          JOHN
          I wish you co'uld've heard the things.
          she was saying before you c&me in. I
          Jatow adults who aren't that mature.

          (BEAT)
          I wonder' why they didn't show us her
          case file.

          KATE
          She probably wasn't there when we were
          first ,looking.

          JOHN
          It just blows may mind, a kid could go
          through as much-as she must have and
          still turn out like that.

          KATE
          You sound like you're sorry we're not
          adopting her instead of Yolanda.

          

          

          

          

          16.

          JOHN
          No, of course not. I just hope she.
          gets the right break.
          (off her look)
          I wouldn't trade our littl'e' girl for
          the world. You )maw that.
          Rate gives him an adoring look and squeezes his hand.

          EXT. HOME FOR GIRLS - ESTABLISHING - MORNING .

          The sun is just rising,.warming the sky with an idyllic light.

          INT. HOME FOR GIRLS - DORMITORY.- MORNING

          The GIRLS (5-7) are busily getting dressed and making their beds.
          The HOUSEMOTHER inspects each of-them in turn. One bed remains
          unmade, its occupant missing. The Housemother turns to the room,
          ready to give a scolding, but can't find who she's looking for:

          HOUSEMOTHER
          Where's Yolanda?

          INT. HOME FOR GIRLS - WASHROOM - MORNING

          The OLDER GIRLS (8-12) are-brushing their teeth and washing up.
          The Housemother enters and looks around.

          HOUSEMOTHER
          Have any of you seen-Yolanda?
          Nobody has.

          INT. HOME FOR GIRLS -- VARIOUS - MORNING

          Sister Abigail leads the NUNS and LAY ASSISTANTS in a search of
          the home, looking for Yolanda. The playroom, art room, chapel,
          classrooms, laundry room, rest rooms.-- they're all empty.

          INT. HOME FOR GIRLS - BASEMENT - MORNING

          A young-nun, SISTER JUDITH, walks downstairs into -a dark storage-
          area. Lots of hiding places. -

          SISTER JUDITH
          Yolanda? Are you hiding-down here?
          Then she notices a closet behind her. The door. is ajar. She
          reaches out, opens it... and nearly gags at what she sees inside.

          LOW ANGIL - INSIDE THE CLOSET
           A child's bare feet dangle in mi , , a .,im3. The "Travel Turtle" is on
          the floor beneath them. - A chair lies on its side nearby.

          

          

          

          

          17.

          INT. HOTEL ROOM -- MORNING -

          Kate dries her' hair in the bathroom. The PHONE RINGS O.S. She
          pauses, suddenly concerned for some reason. She opens the door.
          As John reaches for-the phone, CAMERA MOVES IN on Kate. She
          watches from the doorway, her  face already registering dread. She
          knows. Even before he answers the phone, somehow she knows.

          JOHN (0,S-)
          Bello?

          EXT. HOTEL ROOM BALCONY - DAY

          The sky has turned gray. Kate stares out at the hotel parking-
          lot, smoking a cigarette.  - Her eyes are red;- but she's long since
          cried-herself out. John stands by the open-sliding glass door.

          JOHN
          .The birth family is claiming her body.
          They're planning a private service.
          He looks to Kate for a reaction, but she has none. He continues:

          JOHN
          Sister Abigail thinks she might have
          been playing something called "The
          Choking Game." It's a kind of
          schoolyard dare. You try to get a rush
          by having someone choke you until you
          almost pass out. There have been cases
          where kids have tried it alone and
          accidentally hanged themselves.
          A beat. Kate's voice is distant, as;

          KATE
          So that's it? She just vanishes from
          our lives?

          JOHN
          We can have our awn-service. I think
          .it's important that we -

          KATE
          I've been' in grief counseling for
          almost a year-and-a-half.. If you say
          the word "closure,." I'm going to-claw
          your eyes out.
          She's not angry, just matter-of-fact. Be wants to say something,
          but holds his tongue. Silence hangs heavy between them.

          KATE
          Maybe we're not supposed.to do this.

          

          

          

          

          18.

          - JOHN..
          No. Don't say that. -

          RATE- -
          we -try to .have a baby and I have a
          'third-trimester miscarriage that leaves.
          me sterile. 'We try to adopt and she
          dies the night before we bring her
          home. That doesn't sound like'
          somebody's trying to tell us. something?

          JOHN   -
          Yolanda didn' t the to.teach us a
          lesson.. We didn't make this-happen.

          KATE '
          It doesn't make.anndifference. I
          can't go through this again.

          JOHN
          so let's not. Let's adopt.Bather.
          This brings Kate back to reality. She eyes him coolly.

          KATE
          Her body's barely cold and you're
          already thinking about replacing her?

          JOHN .
          We can't replace Yolanda any more than
          We can replace Jessie. But we can't
          help her anymore, either. Esther is
          alive and needs a family. Right now.

          KATE
          We have to at least wait until.--

          JOHN
          -Until what? I don't want to waste
          .a nother year of our lives wishing for
          something that we.can't-have.
          (beat).
          I want us to feel like a family again.
          Kate regards him for a beat, conflicted. Then:

          KATE
          Let's see what Sister Abigail thinks.

          INT. HOME FOR GIRLS - SISTER ABIGAIL'S OFFICE - DAY -

          Sister Abigail hands Rate and John a folder with a Polaroid of
          Esther stapled to it. Her- case file.

          

          

          

          

          19.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          For the most -part, she's an'ideal
          child. She's originally from Russia,
          but her English is flawless, Smart as
          a.tvhip and very mature Â°for her age. I
          don't think I've-ever had to tell her
          .anything-twice and I've never had to
          clean-up after her.. She's a bit of a-
          nQat-freak.

          JOHN
          I think we can handle that.

          SISTER.ABIGAIL
          She's also fiercely independent.,
          Whatever the other-children want to do,
          she wants to.dc the opposite.

          JOHN
          She told me they make fun of her.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          I'm sure they do, but she doesn't make-
          things any easier on herself. She just
          doesn't seem interested in friends..
          She doesn't even play like a normal
          child. She just reads and paints.
          Most of the time she barely-speaks.

            KATE  
          Why do'you think that is?

          SISTER ABIGAIL .
          Well, like most of the girls here,
          there's been no shortage of hardship in
          her life.- She's been orphaned twice--
          her birthmother died of AIDS, then the
          American family who adopted her was-
          killed in.a house fire. And I strongly
          suspect that she's been sexually abused
          as well.

          KATE
          By who?

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          I don't know. There's nothing in her
          -history, but that doesn't necessarily
          mean anything. Russian adoption -
          records. are notoriously unreliable.

          JOHN
          Then what are you basing this on?
          Sister Abigail hesitates. Deciding how much to say.

          

          

          

          

          20.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          I wish I knew. There's just something
          missing with her. A-spark you see in a
          child's eyes that isn't there. I've
          only seen that-before in cases where
          the child had been severely
          traumatized. It might also explain -
          some of her idiosyncratic behaviors.

          JOHN
          Like what?

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          She refuses to shower or change clothes
          with the other girls.' She won't even
          allow the housemother in-the bathroom
          with her. She.'.s also very concerned
          with her physical appearance for her
          age. She's like a teenager getting
          ready for a date every morning. She
          insists on wearing dresses-every day.
          The ribbons around her wrists and neck
          stay on day and night. . The only
          trouble we ever had with her was when
          we tried to take them off. She kicked
          two of Sister Francis' teeth-out.
          Kate and Tohn are taken. aback. Abigail sighs.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          I'm sorry. I'm 'not trying to
          discourage you. If you're serious,
          I'll do everything I can to-expedite
          the process, given the circumstances.

          (BEAT)
          My one reservation is..this. When-an
          adoption fails, it's usually because
          the parents didn't know what to expect.
          -And'in this case, I can't' tell you what
          to expect because the plain fact of the-
          matter is that-I don't knaw.

          INT: HOME FOR GIRLS - CHAPEL DAY
          Esther is happily-helping a NUN clean the sanctuary. Kate and
          John sit in a pew near the back of the empty chapel.

          KATE
          She really did open up with us, didn't
          she?

          JOHN
          She latched. right onto you. We're
          probably the best chance she has at a.
          normal life.
          Esther looks up from her work and waves at them. They wave back.

          

          

          

          

          21.

          KATE
          A normal life..' That sounds really
          good,',doesn't it? -
          She smiles. and takes John- .'s hand.

          EXT. HOME FOR GIRLS - DAY.

          CAXERA FOLLOWS Esther's feet, saddle shoes CLICKING on -the walk.
          Kate walks beside her, holding her hand. In Esther's free hand,
          she clutches a DOG-EARED BIBLE held together with a rubber band.
          Activity on the playground stops as the girls watch Esther leave.
          None of them look sorry to see her go. She ignores them.
          John puts.Esther's things ---- a small suitcase and her-paintings
          in the trunk of the car.. Sister-Abigail sees them off.-

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          If you ever need anything, please don't
          hesitate to call.
          Before Kate. can respond, Esther tugs on her arm.

          _ESTHER
          Come on! Let's-go)
          Kate laughingly lets Esther drag her away.

          smile fades. She seems'vaguely troubled as they drive away...

          INT./EXT. JOHN'S CAR - DAY

          Headed for home. Kate is showing Esther some SIGN LANGUAGE.
          Esther makes the sign for each letter as she says it aloud:

          E-S-T-

          KATE

          She makes the sign for 'T." Esther. sees her mistake, corrects it.

          Esther smiles and practices=it a few times.- Outside, the LEAVES
          have turned color. Esther gazes out in-wonder. -

          ESTHER
          It's so beautiful, motta.

          KATE
          Sweetie, here we say "Mont" or. "mommy."

          ESTHER
          Kate and John exchange-a warm look.

          EXT. PRIVATE ROAD - DAY

          John's car turns at a GATE and drives down the road leading-to
          their private community. The secluded road winds through the
          forest and crosses the little BROOK we saw earlier.

          EXT. NEIGHBORBOOD' - DAY

          The Coleman's neighborhood 3.s surrounded by forest,-an upscale
          community of big houses and manicured lawns. A POSTMAN delivers
          the mail. A HISPANIC NANNY pushes a BABY in a stroller.
          GARDENERS tend someone's flowers. Esther
          -soaks it all in.

          EXT. COLEMAN RESIDENCE - DAY

          They pull into the driveway and get out. Esther's mouth
          practically hangs open at the sight of their beautiful house.
          The front door opens and Max runs out to meet them. Daniel
          appears in the doorway-with DORIS COLEMAN (arid-60's), their
          grandmother. Daniel stands aghast at the sight of the strange,
          pale girl with the Goldilocks curls and frilly white dress.

          DANIEL

          (SOFTLY)
          -Holy shit:..
          Max. runs straight into Kate's arms and gets a big hug.

          KATE
          Oh, we missed you so muchll
          Kate gives Max a kiss, then turns to Esther: Max hangs back, a
          little shy. Esther signs' to Max without speaking: -

          ESTHER

          HELLO, MAX. MY NAME IS ESTHER.
          Max gives Kate an excited smile.

          KATE
          She's been practicing the whole way.

          

          

          

          

          23.
          Kate takes the girls' hands and they all walk up'to the house.
          Esther notices Man's hearing aid.

          EST-HER -
          What's that?

          KATE .
          That's a hearing aid. It helps her
          hear.a little so she can read lips.
          John gives Doris a Use on the cheek.

          JOHN
          Hi, Mont. Thanks for watching them.
          (to Esther)
          Esther, this is Grandma Doris.

          A pleasure to meet you.
          Esther surprises everyone by giving her a perfect ltttle rtse
          Daniel fails to suppress a laugh. Kate silences him with a look.

          DORIS
          How precious! It's a pleasure-to meet
          you, too.

          JUN
            (to Esther)
          And this is our son, Daniel.
          Esther smiles and puts out her hand. Daniel grudgingly takes it.

          Hello, Daniel.

          DANIEL
          Hey.

          INT. COLEMAN RESIDENCE - VARIOUS - DAY

          Esther walks from room to room, in awe of her luxurious new home.
          Kate and the rest of the family follow her.

          ESTHER
          Everything's so bigi
          As Esther moves on to the next room, Daniel hangs back and
          whispers to John, too loud:

          DANIEL
          Why is she dressed like that?

          JOHN
          Don't be rude.

          

          

          

          

          24.
          Esther overhears them, but pretends she didn't. Kate sees this-
          and tries to distract her. -

          KATE
          Would you like to see-your room?
          Esther smiles and nods eagerly. But on the way up the stairs, she
          eyes Daniel furtively, sizing him up...

          INT. ESTHER'S BEDROOM - DAY

          Kate pushes the door open and Esther enters. We recognize the
          room by the arched windows -- this used to be the-nursery.- It's
          been completely made over as a little girl's room, complete with a
          lacy white canopy bed covered with a mountain of STUFFED ANIMALS..
          Esther turns to Kate and John with a toothpaste-commercial smile.

          ESTHER
          It's perfect.

          INT. ESTHER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Esther is in bed, wearing a nightgown. Kate and John tuck her in.

          KATE
          I love you, too, sweetie.
          She kisses Esther on the forehead. John leans in for a kiss and
          Esther,hugs -him tight. Then he and Kate turn out the light and
          close the door. Esther watches them go...-

          INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Kate and John walk to their room, arms lovingly around each other.
          They close their door, leaving the hallway empty and dark. Then:
          CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES back down the hall toward.the closed door of
          Esther's_room, PUSHING IN'on the doorknob, lingering there fora
          long beat... Then we hear the lock CLICK shut.

          Kate and Esther are decorating. Esther pins up some of her  
          paintings. Kate spreads out a selection of wallpaper borders.

          KATE
          Okay, which one do you like?

          ESTHER
          These are for a'younger child. Did you
          pick them out for Yolanda?
          Kate is taken aback. She stammers for a beat.

          KATE
          I'm sorry. I'll take them back and
          pick some just for you.

          ESTHER
          It's all right. I rather like this
          one.
          Esther points out her.favorite and goes back to pinning up her
          paintings. Kate sighs. As she rolls up the samples, she notices
          the same Gothic mansion in several of Esther's older paintings.

          KATE
          '1s that a real place?

          ESTHER
          No. I just made it up. It's a haunted
          castle where a beautiful- princess was
          locked away. She waited so long and
          was so sad that she filled the moat
          with her tears, but then a handsome
          prince swam ,across it and rescued her.

          INS'. SHOPPING MALL - DAY
          Sliding doors open. Rate and the girls enter. Esther looks
          around, dazzled by three stories of glass-ceilinged extravagance.
          It's totally alien to her. -

          KATE
          These are cute.

          ESTHER
          -Jeans are ugly.

          KATE
          But sweetie, you have to have something
          you can play outside in.

          ESTHER
          That doesn't mean I have to look like a
          boy.

          INT. SHOPPING MALL - DAY

          Kate leads the girls through the mall, carrying BAGS of purchases.
          Something catches Esther's eye. She hangs back, distracted.
          It's a pet store. ' In the display is an aguarium filled with
          TROPICAL. FISH, their vibrant colors illuminated by a black light
          in the tank. Esther gazes in, nose practically against the glass.

          RATE
          You like fish?

          ESTHER
          I like all beautiful things.
          Kate taps Max's shoulder and signs to her.

          KATE
          You should show her Hodgepodge when we
          get home.
          Max nods eagerly. Esther givee.them a curious look.

          ESTHER
          Hodgepodge? What's that?

          INT. MAX'S 13EDROOM -- DAY

          HODGEPODGE is a hamster. Esther kneels in front of his cage for a
          closer look. Kate stands behind her. Max beams proudly.

          KATE
          Max. takes care of him all bir herself.
          It's her big girl responsibility.

          ESTHER
          Aaaww,-can I pet him?

          Sure. But you have to promise not to-
          let him out of his. cage .unless- Hcumey or
          Daddy is,here to hold him.

          ESTEER
          Why? -

          KATE
          Because he's very delicate and you
          could hurt him. Okay?
          Esther xiods. Kate scoops.flodgepodge up and kneels between the
          girls. Esther and Max share a  smile as they stroke his-fur.

          A banner reading."WELCOME HOME, ESTHERII'" has been hung. John

          -DORIS
          They grow up fast, don't they?

          KATE
          Too fast.

          DORIS
          So what are your plans now?

          KATE
          Well, we'll get Esther settled, then
          I'll probably go back, to work.

          DORIS
          Oh, so you think.they'll take you back?
          Kate's eyes flicker with irritation.

          KATE
          I'm not talking about Yale. I'm going
          to teach piano lessons from home.

          DORIS
          I see. That was such a good position
          you had at Yale. It's a. shame.

          KATE
          I didn't quit because I wanted to. I
          quit because.I couldn't work anymore.

          KATE
          She's fine.
          Kate's pointedly not making eye contact with Doris now.

          DORIS
          Well, it's a shame that it took
          something like that for you to :get
          help, but I'm glad you did.
          Kate takes. the plate of food and leaves without looking at her.

          EXT. COLEMAN RESIDENCE - POOL - NIGHT -

          Dinner's over. Daniel has changed into swim trunks and SPLASHES
          around in the pool. Everyone else is gathered around Esther,
          who's opening a few small presents. She unwraps a BOOK OF SIGN
          LANGUAGE and gasps excitedly.

          ESTHER ,
          This is perfect! Thank you! Eiow do I
          say "thank you?"
          Kate shows her. Esther turns and makes the sign to Max.

          MAX

          YOU'RE WELCOME.
          Behind them, Daniel climbs out of the pool and runs out to the end
          of the diving board, poised to jump back in.-

          DANIEL,
          Dad! Watch this!
          But John is focused on Esther.- She's opening a big present
          la1aled "FROMi DADDY." Daniel can't get his attention.

          DANIEL
          Dad! 'Dad!! Dad, look!!
          John distractedly glances over his shoulder at him and Daniel does
          a huge cannonball into the pool. SPLASH!
          Suddenly, Esther squeals with glee. She's unwrapped an IIRT EASEL
          and NEW PAINTING SUPPLIES. By the time Daniel-'s smiling face pops
          out of the water, he's disappointed to find that Esther has drawn
          John's attention again, barraging him with-hugs and kisses.
          She looks at Daniel over John's shoulder and hticks her tongue out
          at him. Daniel fumes.

          into the darkened roam by the hand.

          KATE

          at.him. Then something catches her eye in the moonlight:
          Ethel Jg.wat ,them fr m the -open b edr door, hgr hen
          frozen 9J1 tth dooxknob.

          KATE
          Oh, my God!
          They hurriedly pull the sheets up and Kate turns on the bedside
          lamp. Esther stares at them blankly.

          KATE .
          Esther, honey? What is it? Are you
          okay?
          Esther just glowers at'her, then turns and walks away.

          

          

          

          

          39.

          INT.'ESTBER'S BEDROOM - DAY

          Esther. Sits at her easel, painting. Kate enters and sits down on'
          the bed. Esther doesn't look:at her. She's painting a
          sophisticated, stylized PORTRAIT OF KATE. -Other PORTRAITS of the
          family -arealready pinned to the wall. Kate shifts uncomfortably.
          We need to talk -about last night.

          ESTU
          Do we?

          KATE
          Yes. There are certain things that.
          grown-ups do. that kids aren't supposed
          to see. And that was one of them.
          Esther keeps painting. She still hasn't looked at her. -

          KATE
          Esther, I need you to listen to me..
          Esther pauses. She deliberately sets her paintbrush down and
          turns to Kate. An awkward beat.

          KATE
          See, when two grown-ups love each other
          very, very much, they like to. show that
          love to each other --
          Iknow.- They fuck.
          Kate is dumbfounded. Esther regards her with a bored, aloof-look.

          INT. JOHN'S DEN - DAY

          John is troubled by what Kate has told him.

          JOHN
          - She could nave picked it up anywhere.
          Bell, she probably heard it at school.

          KATE
          This wasn't something she overheard.
          She knew what it meant. And the way
          she said'it. I don't even think she
          expected to get in trouble over it.

          JOHN
          We'll talk to her about it tonight.

          KATE
          You think that's enough?

          

          

          

          

          40.

          JOHN'  
          What do you suggest?

          KATE '
          I could take her to Doctor Browning.

          JOHN
          It was one dirty word. I don't think
          we need to call in the shrink just-yet.

          KATE    
          Maybe. It just reminded The of what
          Sister Abigail said.. We really don't
          know that much about her.'- The last
          'family she-was with could have been -
          like, "Pass the fucking potatoes" at
          the dinner table for all we know. '

          JOHN
          Iget it, I just- don ''t want to make a
          bigger deal out of it than it is.

          KATE
          If she's saying "fuck" to my face,
          what's she doing when we're not around?
          We have to be thinking about what kind
          of influence she's having-on Daniel and
          Max. Particularly Max.

          JOHN
          I wouldn't worry about it. You're
          right, we don't know how she was
          raised, but we do know she's a good
          kid. if Danny and Max want to start
          acting.like her, that's fine with me.

          EXT. COLEMAN RESIDENCE - DAY

          Esther and Max pick wildflowers along the edge of the forest.

          ESTHER
          Let's pick flowers for Daddy.
          Max.nods happily. 'Then Esther notices something that makes her
          stop short. A girl approaching on a bicycle...
          It's Brenda. She pretends to not see Bather, just rides right by.
          Esther watches, her face strangely slack... then starts to follow
          .her. Max gives Esther a confused look, but tags along.

          EXT. PARK -- DAY

          Esther finds Brenda's bike parked at a neighborhood playground ----
          swings carousel, jun7le gym, and a-tall corkscrew slide made-tor
          look like a rocket ship. There are KIDS playing. MOMS watching.

          

          

          

          

          41.
          A BONELESS GUY with a shopping cart full of stuffed garbage bags
          asleep by a tree. WOMEN. doing pilates. Esther ignores them all.
          Brenda is climbing on the jungle gym with some other kids. Esther
          walks over with Max in tow and just watches Brenda play. Brenda
          sees her and makes a face. Esther just stands there. Staring.

          BRENDA .
          What are you looking at?
          No response. Max tug on Esther's arm, but she's rooted in place,
          staring blankly at Brenda. Finally, Brenda can't take it. She
          climbs off the jungle gym and walks away. Esther watches 'her go..
          Brenda gets on a swing, but just as she starts to get some height,
          Ester' right there,.star n ,_p a her again. Max happily grabs
          a swing for herself, but Esther is fixated on Brenda.

          BRENDA
          Stop staring at.mel Stop ital.
          But Esther is unwavering. Can't take her eyes off of her. Brenda
          gets off the swing and runs
          away. Esther calmly walks after her.

          BRENDA
          Go-away! Stop following me, freak!
          Max sees Esther following Brenda and grudgingly gets off the
          swing, hurrying to -catch up. Brenda gives them an angry look.

          " BRENDA
          Why don't you two,go home and change
          each other's diapers?
          Esther and Max follow Brenda across the park,, Max still uncertain
          about what's going on.. Brenda heads for. the tall corkscrew slide.
          Steep stairs lead to the enclosed top, the tip of the rocket ship.
          Brenda starts up the stairs, then pauses. She turns to Esther.

          BRENDA
          You go first.
          Esther doesn't move, but Max gladly takes her turn. After a beat,
          Esther follows Max up the stairs. Brenda stays behind, watching.
          Max goes down the spiraling slide, but Esther just stands at the
          top, looking down at Brenda.

          BRENDA
          Gol!
          Esther, continues to stare down at her for a beat, then turns and
          -disappears from eight. only. then does Brenda climb up.
          Max runs to the stairs for- another turn. Brenda reaches the top
          and looks around. She sees Max.' But where's Esther? She turns.

          

          

          

          

          42.
          Suddenly, Es er is right in ,AIL of her.   She didn't' go down the
          slide, she was just crouched out of sight. Brenda gasps --
          -- then Este spits Jn her face acrd ush hex dawn the airs.
          Brenda SCREAMS as she falls,-limbs flailing, out-of-control. She
          lands hard in the dirt and just lies there crying, clutching her
          arm and bleeding from a gash in her forehead.
          Brenda's scream draws alarmed looks. The Homeless Guy startles
          awake. one of the playground mothers comes running to help. But
          Max stands frozen, gaping at Esther in total shock. Esther stares
          blankly down.at Brenda from atop the slide. Utterly emotionless.

          EXT. PARK - DAY (TIMCUT)

          BRENDA'S FATHER arrives on the scene. Brenda says something. to
          -him and points at Esther and Max, who watch from a distance.

          ESTHER
          Are you going to tell on me?
          Max shrugs.

          ESTHER
          I didn't mean to hurt her. I just
          wanted her-to stop picking on me.
          (off Max's look)
          Don't you hate it when someone is mean
          to you for no reason? Wouldn't you do
          almost anything to make them stop?
          A best. Max nods. Esther offers her hand and Max takes it.

          INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

          Esther and Max sit at the table. Kate and John eye them sternly.

          JOHN
          Brenda says you pushed her.

          ESTHER
          That's not true! We were just playing
          and she tripped! I swear!

          KATE
          (to Max)
          Did you see what happened?
          Esther eyes Max expectantly. Max hesitates. Then:

          MAX

          IT .WAS AN ACCIDENT.
          Kate sighs, not entirely convinced...

          

          

          

          

          43.

          Kate's watering the plants when she feels something on'her hand.
          There's an ANT on it. She flicks it off. Then she seed ANOTHER,
          this one crawling up her arm. She makes a face and looks down.
          Thg g are ante arwl ng loon a-: arou her feet. She
          quickly steps back,- brushing at her- arms and legs. She looks
          under one of the plant tables to'see what's attracted them:
          It's Hodgepodge. He's been dead for several days, his body
          swarming with ants and MAGGOTS.

          EXT.-COLEMAN RESIDENCE ï¿½ GARDEN - NIGHT

          A hole has been dug in the backyard flower garden. Kate, John,
          Esther, and Max stand around it. Max places a shoebox with
          "HODGEPODGE" written on it in the hole and lays a flower on top of
          it. John starts shoveling dirt into the bole.
          Esther and Max exchange a knowing look...

          INT. MAX'S BEDROOM - DAY

          Esther and Max are giggling and playing dress-up. Clothes are
          strewn everywhere. They're both trying to look grown-up. They're
          even wearing makeup -- heavy mascara and pink, painted cheeks.
          Daniel walks by and sees Max putting on lipstick. He takes it
          away from her.

          DANIEL
          Hey, you're not allowed to wear makeup.
          Does mom know you have this?

          ESTHER
          Give it-back.

          DANIEL,
          Make me.

          ESTHER
          Give it back'or I'll tell Daddy, that
          you hit her and then you'll be in
          trouble.
          Max smiles. Daniel-scowls at Esther, then gives Max the lipstick.
          He leaves. Max gives Esther a hug. Best friends forever.

          f l iT. SUPERMARKET - DAY
          Kate waits in line -at the check-out. Esther and-Max are with her.
          Aw .Kate pushes her cart up to the-counter, she looks over and sees
          the nearby'"WINE & SPIRITS" aisle. No big. deal, just a passing
          glance, a flash of idle distraction. Her eyes unreadable. Then:

          ESTHER (O.S.)
          What kind of sex do men crave most?
          Kate-looks back, shocked. Esther has picked up a "COSMOPOLITAN"
          from the newsstand and is'reading the cover aloud-to Max.

          KATE
          Put that away. Don't look at those.
          Kate puts the magazine back. There are several others just like
          it at kids-eye level. "Orgasms UNLIMITED!" "Thrill EVERY INCH- Of
          Him J" Kate'sighs and-'starts putting groceries on the conveyer.-

          ESTHER
          "How To Hit Your G-spot Every Time."
          Kate whirls. Esther has picked up the same magazine. Kate
          angrily snatches it and pulls Esther toward her. Max startles.

          KATE
          Stand where I can see yowl

           
          The CASHIER and a couple CUSTOMERS turn to look at her. Kate
          ignores them. Esther can't suppress a little smile.

          INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

          The family is eating dinner. Esther makes a face and pushes her
          plate away half-finished.  

          ESTHER
          May I be excused?

          KATE  
          At least eat your chicken.

          ESTHER
          I'm not going to eat something that I
          don't like just to make you feel
          better. That's ridiculous.

          JOUN
          Esther, stop it. Eat the chicken and
          then you can be excused.

          ESTHER
          Yes, sir.
          Esther starts eating. Kate gives John an exasperatedlook.

          -KATE

          She broke her arm and had to have

          think. She was lucky.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          She doesn't. sound very lucky.

          JOHN
          She's lucky she didn't break her neck.
          Sister Abigail seems troubled by this.

          EXT. COLEMAN RESIDENCE - DAY

          Sister Abigail walks out to her car, concerned. She doesn't see
          Esther spying down from her bedroom.window, just staring at her

          As they head home, they see JOYCE 'PATTERSON (late 30's) jogging
          toward them. A blonde with dark roots and an overdone boob job.,

          the College Student.- She sees John talking to Joyce and gives
          them an unreadable look before going back inside.

          reads. We see a Polaroid of Esther stapled to the cover...

          EXT. CARNIVAL - NIGHT

          Midway rides and boardwalk games have been set up in the parking
          lot of Daniel and Esther's school. A banner reads ""EDGAR
          ELEMENTARY ANNUAL HALLOWEEN HOOT." The place is packed with
          excited children in Halloween costumes.
          The school is at the'top of a steep hill. Kate and John walk up
          it with the kids. Daniel's dressed as a ninja, Max is a "FINDING
          NEMO" fish, and Esther's an angel, complete with a shiny halo.

          SERIES OF SHOTS
          John gives Daniel some money to hang out with Austin and Trevor...
          On the BOARDWALK, playing games, winning prizes. Esther shoots
          BBs at balloons with a toy rifle. She's pretty good at it...
          On the MIDWAY, Esther and Max are whirled around on the Scrambler,
          screaming and laughing. Kate and John watch and take pictures..'.

          THE HAUNTED -MAZE
          A cheap fun house attraction. The girls ran up to John and Kate..

          ESTHER
          We want to go in by ourselves)

          

          

          

          

          49.-

          JOHN
          Okay, just make sure you hold her hand.

          ESTHER
          I will. -
          The girls. run inside. John smiles, but Kate watches anxiously.

          INT. HAUNTED' MAZE - NIGHT -

          Esther leads Max through the dark', winding fun house corridors.
          Max starts to look cared. She nearly leaps. out of her skin when
          a RUBBER--MASTED GHOUL jumps out at them. But Esther just laughs
          at it. Max sees that she's not afraid and soon they're both
          giggling at the CHEESY SPOOKS that try to scare them.

          EXT. CARNIVAL - NIGHT

          The girls emerge frtn- the'maze, clutching each other and laughing.

          ESTHSR
          Let's play "hide and seek." You go
          first.
          Max excitedly runs off. Esther watches her vanish into the CROWD.
          Moments later,-Kate and John appear. Rate-nervously looks around.

          RATE
          Where's Max?

          ESTHER
          I don't know. I was trying to hold her
          hand, but she pushed me and ran away.

          KATE
          Oh,.my God...

          JOHN
          It's okay. Did YOU see where she went?

          ESTHER
          This way, I think.
          She points the wrong way. Kate takes her hand and they quickly
          move through the crowd, looking for Max. John stands on a bench
          for a better vantage, Kate grabs passersby:

          KATE
          Have you seen a little girl in-a fish
          costume? She has short brown hair?
          Nobody's seen her. Kate grows frantic. Esther watches with a
          nonchalant smile, enjoying the drama.- She tugs on Kate's arm.

          ESTHER
          i Mommy, I want scene cotton candy.
           - 'ï¿½ 'ti

          

          

          

          

          50.

            ICATS
          Not now, Esther Iâ

          JOHN"
          Kate, please. Take it easy. She's
          gotta be around here
          Then Kate spots Daniel approaching, holding Max's hand.' Kate
          breathes a sigh of.relief and rushes to give Max a fierce hug.

          KATE
          Are you all right?- Don't you ever run
          off like that[ What were you thinking?

          DANIEL
          They were playing "hide and seek."- I-
          saw Esther let her run off.
          Esther gives him a sharp look. John turns on her, . angry.

          JOHN
          Did you lie to us? What did I tell you
          about'holding her hand?

          ESTHER
          I'm sorry, sir.
          She looks like she's going, to cry. John sighs, then turns to Kate
          and Max. Esther gives Daniel a hateful look through her tears.

          EXT. COLEMAN RESIDENCE - MORNING

          The kids pile into the minivan for school. As Daniel climbs in,
          Esther' drops something behind him and pretends to find it.

          ESTHER
          What's this?
          She shows Kate a little PLASTIC BAGGIE OF WEED. Daniel blanches
          when he sees it.. His.treehouse staah..

          INT. JOHN'S DEN - NIGHT

          Kate and John confront Daniel.

          DANIEL
          I wasn't taking it to school[

          RATE
          Then what was it doing 'in-your
          backpack?-

          DANIEL
          I don't knowl" She just put it there to.
          get me in troubles

          

          

          

          

          51.

          JOHN
          Where would'Esther have gotten pot?

          DANIEL
          (a beat reluctant)
          She saw me wCth it in the treehouse.

          -JOAN
          Is that what...you're doing- out .there
          with Austin and Trevor? Smoking pot?!
          Daniel stammers. John stews-.

          EXT. HOUSE - DAY

          John screws a hasp to the treehouse-door with -a POWER DRILL and
          slaps a PADLOCK on it. Daniel stands below,-watching. John
          climbs down, shows Daniel the padlock key, and pockets it.

          JOHN-
          Off limits until further notice.
          Be heads to the house; Esther is playing in the backyard.. She
          takes John's hand and walks inside with him. Daniel watches them.

          INT./EXT. KATE'S MINIVAN - DAY

          Kate pulls out of the driveway with Esther in the back seat. As
          they leave the neighborhood, Joyce Patterson Jogs by in her skimpy
          workout clothes. She-waves. Kate gives a polite nod.

          ESTHER
          Why does she have to'dress like that?

          KATE -
          She just likes the 'attention.

          ESTHER
          Well, I think it's immodest. I don't
          know why Daddy -likes her so much.

          KATE .
          (a beat, apprehensive)-
          What do you mean?

          ESTHER
          He's always smiling at her and talking
          to her. She wants him to come over to
          her house. Did you know that?
          (off Kate's look))
          Please don't tell Aaddy I told. I
          don't want him to be mad at me.-
          Kate doesn't respond, clearly disturbed.

          

          

          

          

          52..

          I EXT. DENTIST'S OFFICE - PARKING' LOT - DAY

          Kate gets out Of the minivan, but Esther stays put'-in her seat.
          Rate sighs, frazzled and distracted.

          KATE
          Esther, come on.

          ESTHER
          X told you, I don't like the de ntist.

          KATE
          There's nothing to be afraid of.

          ESTHER -
          I know. Because I'm not- going-

          KATE
          Esther, get out of the cart Righ t now!
          For a moment, they just glare at each other. Mexican stand-off..
          Then Esther sticks her nose in the air and does as she's told.

          INT.-DENTIST'S OFFICE - EXAM ROOM -- DAY

          The DENTIST lowers Esther back in the chair, pulls on rubber
          gloves. The HYGIENIST clips a dental bib around Esther's neck.

          HYGIENIST
          She hasn't had a check-up in about two
          years, so she's a little nervous.

          -DENTIST
          she doesn't look to me. Now
          let's have a look at those co ppers.
          Esther just looks at the ceiling with her mouth tightly shut.

          DENTIST.
          Come on, darling, open wide.
          -Esther eyes him anxiously; then reluctantly opens. Just a bit.

          DENTIST
          That a girl: Little wider...
          She opens more. He leans in to take a look...
          Suddenly, she SHdMPS dawnn his jinx s hard Pnou h to draw blo-mss fr
          and locks ï¿½n like Rottweileï¿½] The Hygienist is frozen in shock.

          DENTIST
          Aaagh! Goddammit!! Help me with her !
          The Hygienist holds her down while the Dentist tries to pry her
          mouth open. Finally, he yanks his fingers free, cradling them

          

          

          

          

          53.
          painfully. Esther HISSES at ldm like a cat, lips flecked with
          blood. The Dentist and Hygienist exchange a startled. lock.

          INT. DENTIST'S-OFFICE - WAITING ROOM -- DAY

          Canned MUSAK.. Kate bits waiting. The Hygienist enters.

          HYGIENIST -
          Mrs. Coleman?
          Kate gives her a confused look. Then she notices Esther htanding
          behind the Hygienist with a-smug grin on'her face.

          INT./EXT. KATE'S MINIVAN - DAY

          Driving home.. Kate stews, on her last frayed nerve. Esther gazes
          out the window, seemingly oblivious, singing a little nonsense
          song under her breath: "La-la-la, la-la-la-la... La--la-la ..."
          Kate stops at a traffic light. Glances outside.
          She's stopped next to a LIQUOR.STORE. Kate quickly looks .away,
          her temptation real enough to startle her. The light turns green
          and she drives off without looking back. Esther keeps SINGING..
          A few blocks later, they pass a BAR. Then a bus shelter with a
          big ABSOLUTE VODKA AD. Kate probably drives by them every day,
          but now they're popping out at her, sly old enemies that never
          really left, re-emerging from the shadowy recesses of her mind.
          She tries to focus on the road, Esther's VOICE grating in her
          head... "La-la-la, la-la-la-la:.. La-la-la, la-la-la-la..."

          INT. FOYER -- DAY

          Kate and Esther enter. Esther skips upstairs. Kate sighs, angry
          and frustrated. She plays a message on the ANSWERING MACHINE.

          SISTER ABIGAIL (V.0.)
          Hello, this is Sister Abigail calling
          for John and Kate. Please call me as
          soon as you get this message. I have.
          something that we need to discuss in
          person. It's regarding. Esther.

          UPSTAIRS
          Esther stands at the top of the stairs, listening to-the message-
          She's heard everything. And she's scared. Scared and pissed.

          INT. KATE AND JOHN'S BEDROOM.- NIGHT

          Kate and John get ready for bed.

          KATE
          He's been our dentist for ten years.
          Why would he lie to us?

          

          

          

          

          54.

          JQAN
          I didn't say he's lying. I just think
          Ws-blowing it out of proportion,

          KATE
          I saw the bite marks. We're lucky he's
          not suing us.

          JOHN
          Fine, but I don't believe for a"second
          that she just did it for no reason.

          RATE
          That's because she's always on her best
          behavior with you.

          JOHN'
          That's. not true. I've had to deal with
          her at her worst..

          - KATE
          What you think is her worst is what
          she's like with me all the time. She's
          completely- different with me than she
          is with you'.,

          JOHN
          So you've seen her haul off'and bite
          someone like an animal?

          KATE
          No, but she threw that fit at school

          JOEN
          Yeah, because the other kids were
          harassing her. It's the same thing
          here.
          (off her reaction)
          She's from a completely different
          culture Kate. She has to be taught
          that this. behavior isn't appropriate
          but there's nothing malicious about it.
          If'she says she bit him because she was
          scared and he was hurting her, I don't
          see any reason not to believe her.
          A beat. Kate looks at him. She's stewing hbaut something.

          KATE
          So should .1 believe her when she says
          you've been hitting on Joyce Patterson?

          JOHN'
          (taken aback)
          Did she say that?
          t.

           

          

          

          

          

          55.

          ]CATS
          Is it true?

          JOHN
          of course not!

          KATE
          Did-she invite You over?'

          JOHN
          She wanted me to help her move a chair.

          KATE
          Oh, - come on.

          JOHN

          ON
          All right, she was obviously coming
          to me. But I shut her down.

          KATE
          Then why didn't you tell me?

          JOHN
          Because I knew how you'd reactl

          KATE
          Really? You sure it wasn't because you
          were coming-on to her so obviously that
          an eight-year-old picked upon it?
          A long-beat. John sighs, resigned.-

          JOHN
          How-long are you going to keep this
          hanging over me? It was ten years ago.

          KATE
          You keep-saying that. But it's only
          been about two years since you told me.
          (a tense beat)
          Having another child was -supposed to
          bring us together.

          JOHN
          I'm sorry I didn't tell you-about it-
          x just feel like I've earned a little
          trust here.

          KATE -
          I don't know what you expect from me.
          I might never completely trust you
          again. Not like before.

          JOHN  
          I gave you a second chance.

          ï¿½4

          

          

          

          

          56.
          Kate stops short. IIis words-are like a phybical blow.

          - KATE -
          That's not fair.

          JOHN
          So-you can keep bringing uP my . mistakes
          over and Over, but we're not even
          allowed to discuss yours?

          KATE
          I was sick! You were just an asshole
          who wanted to fuck somebody else!

          JOHN
          You were a danger to our children. If
          I didn't want to. make this work, I
          could have left months ago and nobody
          would have blamed me.

          KATE
          Nice. Is that-what-your mother told
          you?
          Angry tears well in her eyes. He realizes be went too far.. Kate
          goes into the bathroom and SLAMS the door.

          INT. MAX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT -

          It's late. Esther and Max sit on the bed in their nightgowns.
          Only the bedside light is on. They're signing to one anothe r.

          ESTHER
          THE MAN LADY YS Comm TOMORROW.

          MAX

          I' M AFRAID. I DON'T WANT HER TO TAKE

          YOU BACK TO THE HOME.

          ESTHER

          NEITUER DO 1. WE HAVE TO SCARE HER

          AWAY. WILL YOU HELP ME?
          Max anxiously nods her head. Esther smiles.

          INT..JOHN'S DEN'- NIGHT

          The room is dark. The girls sneak in, still in their nightgowns,
          and close the door. Esther turns on a :reading lamp.

          ESTHER '
          Look for the key to the treehouse.'
          -Max nods and they start searching the room. Esther rifles through
          John 's desk. - Nothing.  She looks in a closet. A DARK PLASTIC
          CASE with Two PADLOCKS on it catches her eye...

          

          

          

          

          57.
          Max opens a. keepsake chest and finds SEVERAL KEYS on:a ring. She
          excitedly shows them to Esther. Esther smiles and takes them. As
          they're about to leave,.Esther. Uses. She looks back at the-
          closed closet. Then looks at the keys. Max eyes her curiously.
          Esther slides a chair over to. the closet and opens it.. She stands
          on the chair, pulls down the case with the padlocks on it, and
          sets it on the floor. She tries a couple of.keys. Then -- CLICK.
          There's a GUN inside. A shiny revolver and a BOX OF AMMUNITION.
          Esther's face lights up. She.carefully picks up the gun{-turns it
          over, looks at it. Max's eyes nearly pop out. Esther gives her a
          sly look, then loads a single bullet, SPINS. the cylinder...
          .and points the cmn at ax. Ri.aht between the Bye

          ESTHER
          Do you -want to_ play? -
          A beat. Max shakes her head. Esther smiles, fingers the trigger.
          After a long, awful, pants wetting eternity, she lowers the gun.

          ESTHER
          You're right. We'd better not.

          (BEAT)
          Not yet. -

          INT. LIVING ROOM -- DAY

          Sister Abigail sits across from Kate and John with a grave look.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          When you first asked about adopting
          Esther, I expressed some misgivings.
          But I wasn't completely straightforward
          with you. You see, I love children.
          I've worked with them my entire life.
          And the thing about love is that it
          sometimes clouds your judgement.

          (BEAT)
          But the truth is that I knew there was
          something wrong with Esther from the
          moment I laid eyes on her.
          Kate sits up, concerned. John bristles.

          - KATE
          You said you suspected, some kind of
          abuse.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          Yes, but there was something else. It
          was hard to say chat it was at first.

          Then I notaced that she - always
          k_ to. be around whenever ther' wwasa get
          kind of trouble.- Two girls
          iii a fight. And there she'd be .
          Someone would get caught stealing. And ell
          she'd -
          myself it Was But I
          never really. believed it.
           (beat) l who
          After you told me about the gir
          broke her arm, -:E -started wondering
          again. I called the achool:Esther went
          to while she was with the Wallaces and
          asked if there'd been any serious
          accidents while she.Was there.. One
          incident was still fresh in everyone's
          minds. A boy in one of her classes was
          stabbed in the throat with a pair of
          'scissors. All the kids-who saw it
          happen said it was an accident, that he
          was running with the scissors and fell.
          But once again, Esther, was there.

          ANGLE - ESTHER
          is eavesdropping from around the corner. She slips away.

          BACK TO SCENE

          JOAN
          But none of these things were her
          fault.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          That's; g I was reluc!tant to t
          anything bef ore. Now'I think th at may a
          have been a mistake.
          (off their-looks)
          Children like Esther, who've spent
          their entire lives-in institutions,
            have never had' a chance to 'form normal,
          lasting bonds.. The longterm effects
          of 'this- can be devastating.   In the
          very worst cases, children who fail to
          form early attachments are unable to
          learn the difference between'right and
          wrong. They can lie, cheat, steal ---
          .or worse -and and have no remorse
          whatsoever for their actions.' They
          view other human beings as objects,
          pawns for their amusement. And they
          can-be potentially very dangerous.

          This.doesh't sound like Esther at all.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          A severely character-disturbed child
          can appear to be -completely normal,
          -even exceptional. It's like they have
          two faces one-they show the outside
          world in order'to get what they want,
          and the other, their true face, lying
          just beneath the surface.

          Max sits on her bed, wearing a jacket and clutching her "Bello.

          Let's go.

          INT. LIVING ROOM  - DAY -


          KATE
          What about the orphanage in Russia
          where she was raised? Wouldn't they
          have been able to tell?

          SISTER ABIGAIL -
          I've put in a call to the director
          there, but she could have easily
          slipped through the. cracks.

          JOHN -
          So the bottom line here is that you
          don't have proof of any of this.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          That's true,-I don't. But I believe
          the circumstantial evidence is enough
          to warrant taking the next step.

          RATE
          Which is what? -

          SISTER -ABIGAIL
          Get Esther out of'the house.
          Kate and John are stunned.

          JOHN
          You want to disrupt the adoption over
          this?!

          

          

          

          

          - 60.

          SISTER ABIGAIL -
          If I'm-wrong, she-can come back home.
          But you need to get her to a therapist
          who can tell you what you're dealing

          WITH

          JOHN
          She's just a kids -  

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          She's also the sole-survivor of a house
          fire that killed her last family.
          (off their looks)
          It was arson. I did some checking.
          Someone deliberately set that fire.
          They-never caught who did it.

          JOHN
          Wait a minute, you're not suggesting --

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          Pyromania is one of the warning signs
          of a character--disturbed child.
          Rate blanches, realizing:

          KATE
          Do you think she had something to do
          with'what happened to Yolanda?
          A long beat. Sister Abigail hesitates, reluctant to answer.

          SISTER ABIGAIL -
          The thought that a child could cougnit
          such a monstrous crime flies in the
          face of everything I hold dear. But in
          my opinion, at'a a possibility that you
          need to take very seriously.

          INT. NOW SHED - DAY.

          Esther slides the door open -on SCREECHING rails and steps inside.
          Walks over to John's workbench. Looks at the TOOL RACK above it.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Kate and John are stunned by what Sister Abigail has told them.

          JOHN
          We can take her to Doctor -Browning. -
          Kate suggested doing that weeks ago.
          But I don't want to send her away. Not
          without at least some kind of proof.
          Sister Abigail.sighs, frustrated. Kate turns to him:

          

          

          

          

          61.

          KATE
          But what if 'the doctor says she's
          dangerous?
          A beat. He considers, uncertain and emotional.

          JOH1
          Then I guess we.won't.bave any choice.

          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          Daniel sits near.the brook, sullenly throwing rocks in the water.
          He hears something behind him and turns. Esther and Max are
          running off through.the woods, leaves CRASHING under their feet.'
          Neither of them ree him. He eyes them curiously.

          Sister Abigail ie leaving. Rate and John stand by the front door,
          'troubled, watching her go.

          EXT. PRIVATE ROAD -- DAY

          Esther and Max run toward'the bridge where. the road into the
          neighborhood crosses the brook. They climb an embankment and
          crouch. by the bridge abutment, out of breath. Esther looks both
          ways. There's no traffic. She and Max hide behind the abutment.

          INT./EXT. SISTER ABIGAIL'S CAR - DAY

          Sister Abigail drives away., troubled. She takes a pack of
          cigarettes from the glove compartment and lights one.

          EXT. PRIVATE ROAD - DAY

          The girlb wait by the abutment. The only sound is the RIPPLING
          brook. Max looks nervous. Esther gives her a reassuring smile.

          ESTHER -
          It's going' to be fine. Just wave your
          arms and make sure she stops.
          Max nods. Then Esther hears a CAR coming. She peers out'from
          behind the abutment. It's Sister Abigail's car. Esther quickly
          ducks out of sight.

          ESTHER
          Here she. comes. Wait until she gets
          close.
          Max nervously peers out from behind the abutment. Esther stands
          behind her. The car starts across the-bridge. Suddenly --
          -- sthe pusbes Max it into the Load. stumbles and falls
          ri ht ,m. on of the _speedï¿½ car.

          

          

          

          

          62.
          Sister Abigail gasps and SLAMS on the brakes, 'TIRES SQUEALING,
          stopping the car mere feet from where Max lies in the road. She
          frantically. jumps out of the car and kneels next to Max.

          SISTER ABIGAIL
          Dear Lord! Are you okay, honey?
          Max looks up at her,-stunned, but unhurt. Sister Abigai1 is taken
          aback. She recognizes her.

           SISTER ABIGAIL -
           Max...?! - -
           A SHADOW falls on Abigail from behind. She turns and looks "up.
           Esther looms.over her, a CLAW HAMMER raised above her head.
          efor is a Abigail Va e a , Esther angrily hits her in tie ' l
           head as hard as she can with the hammer. CRUNCF#.
          Max startles,'eyes wide with shock. Sister Abigail falls and lies
          twitching on the pavement. Eyes staring blankly, one pupil wide
          from the head trauma. Blood trickles from under her headdress.
          As Max stares at. the body, paralyzed with fear, Esther scurries
          into Sister Abigail's car and finds her purse. She flips through
          her wallet. Cash, credit cards. Takes it all. Finds her rosary
          beads. Grabs them, too. Then she hurries back to the body.

          ESTHER
          Help me get her off the road.
          Max looks up blankly, then staggers .to her feet. They each take a
          hand and start dragging Sister Abigail's body, but she's heavy and
          they're little. It's all they can do to slowly move her.
          Then Esther hears something. There's ANOTHER CAR coming. It's
          still out of sight through the trees, but closing.
          Esther and Max hurriedly drag the body, struggling it to the side
          of the road, just as the car rounds the bend. Esther gives the'
          body a kick,, sending it rolling down the embankment.
          The car is almost on them. Esther and Max quickly hide under the
          bridge.. Esther grabs Max's backpack and pulls u wig _cm.
          The car reaches the bridge. Esther listens to it cross, tense,
          gun . ready... . but it passes Abigail's car and continues without
          stopping. Esther breathes a sigh of relief.
          Suddenly, there's a CROARING_noise from behind them.' Esther
          turns. It's Sister Abigail. She's still alive. She's trying to
          speak, but all that comes out is an awful'MOAN.
          Esther scowls and grabs the hammer. Sister Abigail looks up at
          her,' moaning louder. Then Esther brings-the hammer down. CRUNCH.
          The moans stop. Esther hits her AGAIN and AGAIN.

          Good. Let's get her covered up.
          Esther starts scooping leaves and debris onto Sister Abigail's
          corpse. Max just watches fora long beat... then shuffles over
          like a zombie and helps her. Esther smiles..

          That doesn't matter. 'They'll send you
          to jail just for helping me bury her.
          Max starts to cry. Esther moves closer, comforting.

          ESTHER
          She wanted to take me away from you.

          the Homeless Guy across the park and casually heads toward him.
          As she approaches, we see that she's carrying the -plastic yrocery
          bag with the bloody hammer and sister Abigail's things in t.
          She carefully looks around to snake sure nobody is watching, then
          nonchalantly tosses the incriminating bag into the Homeless Guy's

          Esther. fidgets, impatient. She turns to the Secretary:

          ESTRER
          May I go to the restroom?

          INT. DOCTOR BROWNING'S OFFICE.- DAY

          Dr. Browning continues. Kate' can't believe what 'she's hearing:

          DR. BROWNING
          I was able to coax her into admitting
          that there's been some tension between
          the two of-you. She's really tr!ing
          very hard to please you. The problem
          is that you're blocking her attempts-to
          attach-with you. That's why whenever
          something bad happens, you blame her,
          whether it's really her fault or not.

          KATE
          But that's not what's.been happening.

          DR. BROWNING
          I doubt you're even aware that you're
          doing it. But subconsciously you t aunt
          her to be bad because' demonizing her is
          your way of covering your own feelings _
          of inadequacy as a mother.

          KATE
          I don't feel inadequate.

          DR. BROWNING
          But you do have doubts. You worry that'
          you Could relapse.

          KATE
          What does that have to do with'Esther?

          DR. BROWNING
          Frankly, everything. Your guilt over
          what happened with Max is preventing-
          you from bonding with Esther.
          Kate turns to John, aghast, but he's taking this very seriously.

          DR. BROWNING
          It's made you doubt your fitness as a
          mother. And that terrifies you. So
          you're having trouble with Esther,
          alonV comes Sister Abigail with these

          For all, her good intentions, sister
          Abigail was not a trained psychologist.
          She'had certain suspicions about Esther

          Rate sits at the table. John has calmed down, but is still angry.

          KATE
          She knew what it meant to me. She did
          it on purpose.,

          JOHN
          It wasn't even her idea.
          (off her look)
          I'm the one who told her she should try

          ER DOCTOR
          It's a hairline fracture in her radius.

            KATE

          ER DOCTOR

          (SKEPTICAL)
          You'll need to talk to the social -
          worker about that. She's going to come

          JOHN

          After a beat, she gathers her courage and quietly enters,
          tiptoeing toward the bed. She pulls back the covers and.climba in

          INT. KATE'S MINIVAN - DAY

          It's raining. Rate sits in the parked van. No sound except
          RAINDROPS TAPPING the roof. She's looking out at something.
          It's the LIQUOR STORE she drove by earlier. She's-parked in front
          of it, staring at it through-the rain-streaked windshield...

          INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

          Kate puts TWO BOTTLES OF WINE on the counter. The CASHIER rings
          them up. She's anxious, guilty, already hating herself.

          KATE
          We're having guests over for dinner.
          The Cashier nods. Like be gives a shit. Kate lowers her eyes.-

          INT. KITCHEN - DAY

          The two wine bottles sit on the kitchen counter. One bottle is.
          open, a GLASS already poured. But Kate's not drinking it. She's
          just standing these, arms folded, looking at it. The house is.
          quiet. She's alone here. Only her demons to keep her company-
          A long moment of. awful indecision passes,, Kate paralyzed. Then
          she looks up, her gaze moving past the wine glass to the window.,
          Through it, she can see the backyard. It's the swimming pool that
          holds her eyes, its cold-surface rippling in the rain. But- she's
          seeing something else there, something awful. Impossible to know-
          what she's thinking, but whatever it Is, it moves her to action:

          

          

          

          

          79.
          She, abruptly grabs the glass and quickly empties it in the sink
          before she-can change hex mind. -Then she grabs the. open wine'
          bottle and pours it all down the drain. She runs the water and
          scrubs the sink with her fingertips, removing every trace. Tosses
          the empty bottle in the trash and ties up the garbage bag.

          EXT. COLEMAN RESIDENCE - DAY

          Kate hurries out in the rain and stuffs the kitchen trash in the
          garbage can, burying it under-another bag.

          Kate re-enters, dripping wet. There's still the other wine

          INT. KATE'S MINIVAN -- MORNING

          Driving the kids to school. Kate looks drawn and weak. Daniel
          and Max stare off into space. Esther holds a stack of her
          paintings in her lap, obliviously prattling:

          ESTHER
          I can't wait for show-and-tell. I hope
          Mrs. Grosse. likes my paintings. I did
          one especially for her..
          .Nobody responds. Kate's blocking her out. Esther doesn't mind.

          EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL/INT. KATE'S MINIVAN - MORNING

          Kate drives up the hill and pulls to the curb. Daniel gets out,
          but'Esther struggles, her wrist cast making her clumsy, and she
          awkwardly fumbles her paintings.. They land in the gutter and
          start-blowing away. She gives Kate a horrible,-pleading-look

          ESTHER
          Moumiy! My paintings!
          Kate eyes her accusingly.

          KATE
          You dropped them on purpose.

          ESTHER  
          No, I didn't! I swear!. -
          Kate doesn't believe it for a second, but sees a CROSSING GUARD
          and a FEW KIDS hurrying to grab the paintings as they're carried
          off by the wind. Kate shoots Esther a dirty look, then sets the
          parking brake with an exasperated sigh and gets out to help...

           Rate sits across from John and Dr. Browning.The mood fa grim:

           KATE
          I set the brake. . Bven if I hadn'tr the
          police said it wouldn't have.:rolled
          unless it was put in neutral.

          DR. BROWNING.
          But Max says she didn't see Esther do
          anything wrong.
          Max is cover.ng for her. And X don't
          think it's the first time.

          DR. BROWNING
          It also-wouldn't be the first time that
          you've tried to blame Esther for.
          something that was really your fault.

          XATE
          This. isn-'t all in my head. Sister
          Abigail was right. There is something
          wrong with Esther. And I don't care
          anymore if I can't prove it. I'want
          her out of this house.
          John and Dr. Browning exchange a dark look.

          DR. B' OWNING
          So you're at a place where you would
          actually let somebody take her away?

          KATE
          I'll do whatever I have to,do to
          protect my children.

          JOHN
          56 will 1.
          (re: Dr. Browning)
          That's why she's here.
          something in his voice makes Kate apprehensive. An uneasy beat.

          DR. BROWNING
          I have an opening held for you at a
          residential rehabilitation clinic about
          forty-five miles from here. They
          specialize in extended treatment for
          women who are relapsed alcoholics.
          Kate is stunned silent. She gapes at. them. with a mix of anger and
          fear, unable to stop' a flash of guilt. How much do they know...?.

          

          

          

          

          .82..

          KATE .
          What are you talking.about?

          -JOHN
          I'll stand by you through this for as
          long as it takes. My mom'a already
          agreed., to 'help look after the - kids . .

          RATS
          Tell her not to bother.
          (to Dr. Browning)
          I'd like you to leave now.

          JOHN
          Kate, don't.
          John stands and takes something from inside the sideboard. Ile
          : sets it on the coffee table between them...
          qtr, s
          the wine bottl g she hid " he closet. Kate is stricken.
          She looks at it like it was a poisonous spider.

          JOHN
          The girls found it while they were
          playing in your. closet.

          KATE
          The girls?" You mean Esther found it.

          JOHN
          Yes, Esther found it. Does that make a
          difference? Is she lying?
          A beat. Kate's silence-is answer enough.

          KATE
          I didn't... I bought two bottles. I
          poured the other one down-the sink.

          JOHN
          But not this onie.
          Again, no answer necessary.. Kate looks defeated, tears welling.

          KATE
          I'm not going to rehab.

          JQHN
          I'm not going to leave you-alone with
          the kids again until you do. - .

          KATE
          I haven't had a drink in almost a year.
          John sighs, frustrated.- Dr. Browning intervenes, her voice
          infuriatingly even. and calm.'

          

          

          

          

          83.

          DR. DROWNING
          Relapse is very common in early
          sobriety. We can help you. But not
          until you drop the charade. -

          KATE
          It's not a charade. I wanted to- drink
          i t. You have no fucking idea how.badly
          I wanted to drink it. But I didn't.
          (off John's look)
          I know 1 should have told you..  I was
          just afraid of what you'd do.

          JOHN
          I wanted you to come to me. That's why
          ,I didn't confront you with it last
          night. If Max had gotten hurt this
          morning, it. would've been because I
          trusted you tell me if there was a
          problem.

          RATE
          What happened this morning had nothing
          to do with this!

          JOHN
          l f ow do you expect me to believe that?

           KATE
          Max and Daniel are the only reason I'm
          still sober. I would never do anything
          that would hurt them.

          DR. BROWNING
          You don't think this behavior effects
          them?

          KATE
          You know damn.well what I'm talking
          about.
          _ Her voice is brittle now, barely controlled. A beat. The tears
          sta rt to spill.

          KATE
          When I look out at the pool and
          think...
          (to John)
          When I try to imagine what would have
          happened if you hadn't come home early
          that day... it makes me want to kill
          myself. I would the before I let
          something like that happen again.

          JOHN
          Then why-not throw both bottles away?

          

          

          

          

          84,

          KATE-
          Becauso"I need help. i thought I could
          handle it myself, but I can't. I'll go
          back to-therapy. I'll start going to
          A.A. meetings.

          JOHN
          That's not enough anymore.' I told you
          last time what I'd do if this'ever
          happened again. I'm trying to give you
          another chance.

          KATE -
          You haven't heard.a word I've said.

          JOHN
          I've heard enough. If it was just the
          two of us, that would be one thing.
          But I can't let you be in a position
          where you could hurt the kids.

          KATE
          I'm not the one you need to be worried
          aboutt Seven people close to Esther
          have died in the past year. Max was
          almost the eighth. now many more
          coincidences are you willing to ignore?

          JOHN
          Kate, stop it. You're talking about an
          eight-year-old girl. And right now
          she's making a lot more sense than you
          are.

          KATE
          I know I haven't given you any reason
          to believe me. But you have to. I'm
          begging you.

          JOHN
          I'm sorry. Maybe if you'd been honest
          with me from the start. But not now.

          ANGLE -- MAX AND ESTHER
          peer around the corner, watching them argue. Max is crying.

          JOHN
          You either check into rehab this week
          or I leave and I take the kids with me.
          Esther leans close and whispers into Max's hearing aid:

          ESTHER
          I'll kill her it you tell..

          

          

          

          

          85.
          Max gives her a frightened look.- Just then, Doris.appears with a
          bowl of popcorn. She quickly ehoos the girls away.

          DORIS
          Come on, you two. Let's go watch TV.
          Max wipes her eyes. Esther takes her hand and leads her away.

          EXT. COLEMAN RESIDENCE -- NIGHT -

          John walks Doris out to her car.-He gives her a hug.

          JOHN -
          You sure you don't mind? She's not
          going to appreciate your being around.

          DORIS
          .I don't care what she appreciates. You
          can't leave those kids alone with her
          while you're at work all day.
          (off his look)
          You're doing the right thing. Don't
          let her change your mind.

          JOHN
          I'll see you tomorrow.
          Doris gets In her car. John looks conflicted.

          Max's eyes are red from crying. She's drawing a picture, but
          hides it under some other papers when Daniel enters. Be closes
          the door. Esther's HUMMING can be heard O.S. A tense beat.

          DANIEL
          Are you okay?'
          Max nods. Daniel sits down next to her. He lowers his voice.

          DANIEL
          Did Esther do something to the van?
          Max turns away and shakes her bead.

          DANIEL
          It's okay. You can tell no. I saw her
          jump out before .it started to roll.
          Max gives him a startled look, suddenly frightened.

          

          

          

          

          86..

          MAX

          DID XOD: TELL ON !3ER?

          DANIEL
          No way. Dad won't believe me. You
          have to do it with me.
          Max shakes her head and starts signing, but Daniel can't keep up.

          DANIEL
          Slow down, 'I don't understand. Did she
          make the van crash?
          A long beat. Max reluctantly nods'. -

          DANIEL
          Then we have to tell Mom and Dad.
          Max starts crying. She signs, but Daniel doesn't understand.
          Frustrated, Max starts hitting him. Daniel grabs her arms

          DANIEL
          -Stop it!- She's going to kill us if we
          don't tell! Morn and Dad can protect
          us!
          Max. shakes her head. Daniel releases her.

          DANIEL
          Why not?

          MAX

          NOBODY CAN.
          Daniel stops short. Max hesitates, then gets up and shows him the
          pictures that she hid from him when he first came in.
          They're crude crayon drawings of Max and Esther. In the first,
          Esther stands atop the rocket ship slide and pushes Brenda down
          the stairs while Max watches..
          The= next one turns Daniel's blood cold. X &'s of Sister Abigail's
          murder. Esther stands over Sister Abigail with a bloody hammer
          wh e r e Max cowers under the bridge. The last one is of Esther and
          Max in the treehouse. Esther is covered in blood.

          DANIEL
          What did she do in the treehouse?

          MAX

          SHE PUT TEE BAD THINGS THERE.
          Suddenly, Esther's O.S."humming STOPS. Daniel looks up, alarmed.

          DANIEL
          r She's coming.

          

          

          

          

          87.
          'Max quickly hides the. pictures-. Daniel scrambles to the door, but
          -pauses and signs to Max as best he can.

          DANIEL
          Everything's going to be all right.

          INT.'UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Daniel hurries back to his room and closes the door, just as
          Esther emerges from the bathroom. She pauses, suspicious.

           Kate and John are in bed. It's 3:23 a.m.' They both appear to be
           sleeping. Then Kate. moves. She's still wide awake.
           She looks over at John, slowly push the covers back, and inches
           out of bed so that he doesn't wake u es' p. She quietly dresses.
          INT tIPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
          Kate emerges from their bedroom with a small OVERNIGHT BAG and
          cree ps into the dark hallway, careful not to make any noise. She
          stops by the. door of Max's bedroom, and slowly opens it.

          TNT. MAX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          Kate slips inside, closes the door; and starts toward Max's bed...-
          Suddenly, a desk light comes on. It's Bather. She's been sitting
          there in the dark. The light casts strange shadows on her face.

          ESTHER..
          Going somewhere, Kate?
          Kate startles and whirls to check on Max. She's. fast asleep.

          ESTHER
          She's fine. Lot's not wake her.

          KATE
          What are you doing in here?

          ESTHER
          1-couldn't sleep. I was-afraid you
          might try to take Daniel and Max away.
          Kate stands frozen, frustrated and'angry.

          KATE
          Go to your room.

          ESTHER

           (a beat, stricken)
           Who told you about that. -
           Esther holds up Kate's journal:: Kate blanches.

           ESTHER
           It's in your journal. I found ï¿½it a few
           weeks ago.. It's very intimate. 3
          learned so much about you. Your
          marital troubles, your drinking
          problem. Where you hide your wine
          bottles. You have lovely handwriting,
          by the way. Would you like to bear my
          favorite part?
          Esther has a page marked. She reads:

          ESTHER
          "Eight weeks before my due date,
          Jessica died-from several undiagnosed
          birth defects. I hadn't felt her move
          for days, but now that I knew she was
          dead, I started-to feel her kick again.
          It's called phantom fetal movement,
          like the pain felt in a missing limb.
          I was an amputee and my baby was the
          lost part of me. Because of other
          complications, Doctor Kosgrove didn't
          want to induce. So I had to wait to go
          into labor. For sixteen days I carried
          Jessica's body and felt her ghostnow a kicking in my-belly. y womb
          coffin and inside me slept a corpse."
          (to Kate)
          How perfectly hideous. No wonder you
          turned into a nasty, smelly drunk.
          Kate is dumbfounded, trembling with impotent rage and raw emotion.

          ESTHER
          Kate. You don't know how lucky you are,
          I'll never have children of my own. My
          father paw to that while I was still-in
          diapers. I. actually don't"remember a

          weak and 'pathetic like you..

          RATE

          ESTHER
          Please. You're soft. Like,& worm.
          Losing your baby could have. made you
          stronger. But for you it's alwa s.more
          therapy and more- pills and more booze.
          Anything so that you don.'t have to
          actually face the so state of your
          miserable existence. And why should
          you? You've got John to carry your
          dead weight around.. But you know
          something? You don't deserve him. And
          sooner 'or later, he's going to figure
          that out.
          Esther stands up to leave. Kate-blocks her path.

          ESTHER
          What are you going to do? Hit me?
          -Kate. looks really tempted. A beat. She puts out her hand for the
          journal. Esther gives it to her with a smile. Kate steps aside.

            ESTHER
          See you tomorrow.
          She leaves. Kate glares after her. -

          the Wallaces that we saw earlier. With one new addition.
          It's the missing page from Esther'.s life book, the picture of Kate

          Then she sees something -- a photo of a Gothic mansion. The sign
          out front reads: "Saarne Instituut." Kate recognizes it   -
          instantly. It's the same Gothic mansion from Bather's paintings.
          She scours the web site for anything' decipherable. There's a -
          link: "KONTAKT JA XNFO." She clicks it. There's a phone number.

          He hugs the side of the treehouse, panicked. The FLAMES grow
          higher, licking at his feet. No place to go now but up.
          He reaches for the edge of the roof and struggles to pull himself
          onto it, his legs kicking out over empty space. He gets an elbow

          alterations. The ruffles are gone, so are-the sleeves. It's low
          cut and too grown up. Her hair is perfectly curled and her face
          is caked with makeup --- powder, red lipstick, thick mascara, dark
          eyeliner -- giving her a grotesque, woman-child, eight-year-old-
          beauty-queen look. JonBenet Ramsey by way of Angelina Jolie.

          ESTHER
          You really mean that, don't you?

          JOHN
          of course. Why don't you go wash your

          -All right. We'll have a little snack
          and then off -to bed.
          Esther beams. John sits down, reluctantly humoring her. Esther
          starts pouring sparkling water into the glasses.

          bottle-of wine, but I couldn't find it.

          But. instead of sitting down,'Esther continues to stand next to

          because she could heverbe a real
          woman. Veera murdered them both.

          just stares at herself in the mirror. With her scars revealed,
          her face scratched, her mascara streaked down 'to her chin, and her
          awful, yellow, snaggletoothed sneer, she looks like a monster.

          She now sees herself as trapped in the
          body of a. child and it disgusts her.
          She wants to. be what her father
          considered to be a "real woman." She t
          wants o be a wife, a mother, a lover.
          She wants to grow up. -

          She rushes to him, but it's obvious that he's dead. She leans
          over his body and bursts into tears, aching at what has been done
          to him... then stop and steels herself for what ]sh jds to do..

          Max hurries inside and hides in the linen closet.

           Kate stands by the door with her back to the wail, holding her
           bloody shoulder. Her eyes flit, searching for a weapon. Nothing.

           She's standing right outside the door. Kate breath.

          Suddenly, Kate lunges body checking Esther against the door.
          They struggle for the gun. It GOES OFF. Kate kno cks it out of

          the gun, can't find it. Kate stirs, fighting to stay cons cious.
          Esther squirms away from her crawls over to John's body, and

          Max tries to- hit. her again, but Esther is ready this time and
          swats the blow aside. She rips the piece of railing from Max's

          Esther falls to the floor, dead gaze staring at the ceiling, a

          Kate drops the gun and crawls over to Max, scooping her into her
