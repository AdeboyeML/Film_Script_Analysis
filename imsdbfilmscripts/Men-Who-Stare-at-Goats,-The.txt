              He is STARING at us with fixed concentration. He is
              sweating slightly in the summer heat. We hold for a
              moment. Silence, apart from the soft swish of an unseen
              ceiling fan.
              WIDE SHOT - the Man, wearing military uniform, sits at
              his desk in his office, still staring straight ahead.

              States Army Intelligence SED. Arlington, Virginia. 1983.
              The General's assistant, LIEUTENANT BOONE, sits at his
              desk, working. After a moment Putkin seems to come to a
              decision.

                                      GENERAL PUTKIN

                             (SOLEMNLY)
                        Boone?

                                        LIEUTENANT BOONE
                        Yes General?

                                      GENERAL PUTKIN
                        I'm going into the next office.

          

                                        LIEUTENANT BOONE
                        Yes sir.

          
              The General stands up, smooths down his uniform, steps
              out from behind his desk and begins to walk. Boone
              watches, with some trepidation, as the General increases
              his pace. He quickens to a jog, his face set with
              determination.

          
              He breaks into a run...

          
              Then he slams into the WALL of the office, rebounds and
              lies splayed on the floor.
              He stares up at the wall balefully.

          

                                        GENERAL PUTKIN
                        Damn it!

              General Putkin is being driven in a jeep through the vast
              military base. He has a band-aid over his injured nose.

                                       GENERAL PUTKIN (O.S.)
                         I have been having ideas,
                         gentlemen. Challenging ideas. And
                         when I thought about these ideas I
                         thought about who in the U.S Army
                         would be most receptive to my
                         challenging ideas.

          
              The Jeep pulls up at the SPECIAL FORCES COMMAND CENTRE.
              The General gets out, a brief case in his hand and
              surveys the centre.

          

                                       GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT'D) (O.S.)

                                       (CONT'D)
                         Which section of the military is
                         always straining to reach the peak
                         of their physical and mental
                         capabilities?

          

          4   INT. SPECIAL FORCES COMMAND CENTRE - DAY                       4

              General Putkin stands in front of a room full of seated

              SPECIAL FORCES OFFICERS.

                                       GENERAL PUTKIN
                         You are, gentlemen. Special
                         Forces.
              The assembled Officers nod modestly.

                                       GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT'D)
                         I want to talk to you about Mind
                         Wars, gentlemen. War...With...

                         MINDS...
              His audience stare at him. With a flourish he produces a
              BENT FORK from his briefcase.

                                       GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT'D)
                         How'd you like to be able to do
                         this? What if you could teach
                         soldiers to do this? Would you be
                         interested?
              Silence.

                                         GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT'D)
                                (changing tack)
                           Or, or let's say you have a unit
                           operating outside the protection
                           of mainline units. What happens if
                           someone gets hurt? How do you deal
                           with that?
              He surveys the blank faces.

                                         GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT'D)
                           Psychic healing! Protect the unit
                           with hands-off healing. Using the
                           mind to heal.
              Silence. Putkin senses he is not convincing his audience.

                                         GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT'D)
                           Let's talk about time! What if
                           time is not a point but a space
                           and at any one instant we can be
                           anywhere in that space! (Laughing)
                           Physicists go nuts when I say
                           that!
              Silence. He is growing desperate.

                                         GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT'D)
                           Animals! Stopping the hearts of
                           animals! This is the idea I'm
                           coming to you with. You have
                           access to animals right?
              Special Forces look like they've had enough. A tough
              looking officer - MAJOR JIM HOLTZ - stirs.

                                         MAJOR HOLTZ
                           No sir. We don't have access to
                           animals.

          

          5   EXT. SPECIAL FORCES COMMAND CENTRE - DAY                   5

              A dejected General Putkin climbs back into his jeep.
              Lieutenant Boone, in the driving seat, looks at him with
              sympathy.

                                         BOB (V.O.)
                           In 1983, when Special Forces told
                           General Putkin that they weren't
                           interested in his ideas...that was
                           a lie.

          

          6   INT. SPECIAL FORCES COMMAND CENTRE - DAY                   6

              The BENT FORK sits on the table in the EXTREME
              FOREGROUND, a window in the background.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                         BOB (V.O.)
                           And when they told him they didn't
                           have access to animals...that was
                           also a lie.
              We FOCUS on the window - a shaky ZOOM taking us towards
              an abandoned looking HOSPITAL BUILDING half hidden by
              trees.

          

          7   INT. ABANDONED HOSPITAL - DAY                               7

              We TRACK forward into the shadowy interior into a large
              space which we now see is full of...GOATS.

                                         BOB (V.O.)
                           The hundred goats in the disused
                           hospital building had been
                           secretly flown in from Central
                           America so as to avoid customs.
                           Special Forces weren't worried
                           about the General hearing the
                           goats because they'd been de-
                           bleated.
              The GOATS stare at us, their mouths silently opening and
              closing.

                                         BOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                           This is the story of those goats.
              We CLOSE ON the unblinking EYES of one GOAT, then...

              Bob sits typing at his desk in the modest office. He
              wears glasses, is attractive in a fresh-faced,
              enthusiastic kind of way. SUPERED TITLES read: Ann Arbor,

                                         BOB (V.O.)
                           My name is Bob Wilton. Imagine me
                           back in Michigan, where I was born
                           and raised. I studied journalism
                           at Western in Kalamazoo and then I
                           got a job at the Ann Arbor Daily
                           Telegram. I wrote a lot of stories
                           about competitive food eating
                           contests.
              He looks at the photograph of his wife Debora on his desk
              and up to where she stands, photocopying in DAVE the
              Editor's office. Dave is chatting to her. He has a
              PROSTHETIC ARM. Bob watches his wife, smiling.

                           Look at me. So young. "The past is
                           a different country. They...do
                           things there."
              We PAN to the next desk and Bob's over-weight colleague
              RON, who sits eating a hot-dog.

                                          BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                           This is Ron.
              Ron suddenly pitches violently forward, thudding face-
              first into his desk.

                                         BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)

          9   INT. OFFICE - LATER                                          9

              Bob is clearing Ron's desk, putting his possessions into
              a box.

                                         BOB (V.O.)
                           My wife, Debora, told me later
                           that Ron's death had been like a
                           wake-up call for her - what people
                           used to call a memento mori.
              Bob sits down, feeling a little ghoulish, at the dead
              man's desk. He notices a large INDENTATION on the leather
              in front of him - the mark left by Ron's forehead. He
              touches it, fascinated.

                                         BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                           That massive coronary had reminded
                           her that life was too short to
                           waste any chance of true
                           happiness.
              Bob rests his own forehead, experimentally, onto the
              indentation, and sits there, face down on the desk. His
              eyes wander over to where Dave and Debora are talking in
              Dave's office.
              BOB'S P.O.V - Debora's hand BRUSHES against Dave's,
              LINGERS just a fraction too long.
              Bob frowns.

                                         BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                           A week after the funeral she left
                           me for my editor.

          

                                                                       6.

          

          

          

          

          10   INT. BOB'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                 10

               Bob and Debora and Dave talking. Bob is drinking. We JUMP
               CUT to Bob crying, smashing a lamp, Debora shouting at
               him.

                                       BOB (V.O.)
                              (A sad chuckle)
                         It seemed like such a tragedy at
                         the time. We couldn't see beyond
                         our little lives to the great
                         events of history unfolding out
                         there in the world.
               JUMP CUT to Dave holding Bob in a head-lock with his one
               good arm. Debora is sitting, head in hands.

                                       BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                         I was like a child. Or a Hobbit,
                         safe in the Shire.
               JUMP CUT to Bob alone in the trashed room, exhausted and
               drunk, watching Bush's STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH on TV.

                                        BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                         Or a blonde farm boy on a distant,
                         desert planet, unaware that he was
                         already taking the first steps on
                         the path that will lead him
                         inexorably towards the heart of a
                         conflict between the forces of
                         Good and Evil.

                                       PRESIDENT BUSH
                              (on TV)
                         Americans are a resolute people,
                         who have risen to every test of
                         our time. Adversity has revealed
                         the character of our country, to
                         the world, and to ourselves...
               Bob wipes his eyes, stares at the screen.

                                       BOB (V.O.)
                         Had I known where that path would
                         lead, had a soft wind from my
                         future brought me the name of Bill
                         Django, I might never have gone.
                         But as it was, I did what so many
                         men have done throughout history
                         when a woman has broken their
                         heart... I went to war.
               We hear the opening of a period song as we...

               Bob sits on the bed talking to Debora on the phone.

                                       BOB
                         Yeah, no it's been...well, I won't
                         lie to you Debora - it's been
                         pretty damn hairy.

                                       DEBORA (O.S.)

                               would like)
                         Yeah. We've been watching it on

                            Yeah, it's not, uh... I've seen
                            things that you shouldn't, you
                            know...
               He shakes his head sadly.

                            Well I don't even know why you're
                            there. You're not exactly war
                            correspondent material are you?

                            people get an accurate picture of
                            what's...

                            What? Yeah.

                            Yeah. He says Hi.
               Bob stares out of the window, nodding, afraid he might
               start to cry.

               He BEATS his head off the wall for a moment.

                                          BOB (CONT'D)
                            Okay. Gotta go. We're moving out -
                            heading up north to cover the

               Bob walks out and puts his sunglasses on, staring around
               the quiet POOL-SIDE area. He sighs, sits down on a a
               sunlounger, starts to read his book. TITLES READ "Kuwait

               Bob is drinking coffee with two gung-ho type war
               correspondents.

                                         BOB
                         Yeah.

                         I've been stuck here. They've only
                         just given me the green-light. So
                         I'll probably head over there
                         soon. I'm just working on this
                         story about American contractors
                         coming over for the re-build.
               The Journalists look bored.

                                       BOB (CONT'D)
                         Yeah, I think they didn't want me
                         going over because I'm not
                         embedded.

                                       SECOND JOURNALIST
                         Yeah, they don't like the unilats.
                         The troops think the unilats'll
                         stab `em in the back. When you're

                         EMBEDDED
                         you form a bond with the soldiers.

                                            MAN
                            I guess.

                                          BOB
                            What's your pitch?
               The man considers this. He looks up and we see his face
               for the first time - handsome, older than Bob, tanned, a
               moustache, a slightly haunted expression. This is LYN

               CASSADY.

                                          MAN
                            Well...we're real cheap.
               Bob waits for more, but that's it. He holds out his hand.

                                            BOB
                            Bob Wilton.

                            Skip.

                                          BOB
                            Could I bum a smoke, Skip?
               Lyn shoves the packet across the table. Bob sits down
               across from him, pats himself down for a lighter, glances
               over to where the two embedded Journalists are joking
               with some Marines. Bob watches them jealously.

                                          BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                            I sat there watching those
                            reporters and realized I didn't
                            want to be me anymore. I wanted to
                            be them. I wanted to face peril
                            and stand witness to the fall and
                            rise of nations.
               Suddenly the TERRACE LIGHT above them flickers and goes
               out. Lyn and Bob sit in the dark.

                            Like the man said. I wanted a
                            mission.

                                          BOB (CONT'D)

                            Oh crap, can't find my...
               A LIGHTER ignites in Lyn's hand, eerily lighting the
               lower half of his face, his eyes hidden by the brim of
               the cap. Bob leans forward to light his cigarette and
               finds himself staring at the CONFERENCE I.D Lyn has
               pinned to his shirt. The name on the badge reads LYN S.

               CASSADY.

                         This is the home learning course
                         we're putting out, which is very

               Bob is interviewing Gus Lacey at Lacey's dining room
               table. Gus has a sun-bed tan and odd hair. His nervous
               looking MOTHER sits beside them. Gus is holding up a
               VIDEO CASE for Bob to see - the cover, illustrated with a
               picture of Gus, reads "Free To Roam - Learn E.S.P from

                         time, right here, remote viewing.

                            which it turns out is the ghost of

                            So...when did this all start for
                            you Gus?

                                          GUS LACEY
                            It started when I was a kid. I
                            used to lie on my bed and RV my
                            cousin, Irene, undressing at
                            night. Then, when I was in the
                            army I joined Bill Django's unit.
                            He trained me and the rest, as
                            they say...

                            So what did you do in the army?

                            We were Psychic Spies mainly. That
                            was our initial tasking but...once
                            they realized what they were

                            liberal. She said "Don't show him

                            bizarre instead."
               Bob looks to Gus' Mother who manages to look nervous and
               defiant at the same time. Gus stares at the blank TV,
               sips his coffee.

               Bob hurries to catch up with Lyn. He follows him around a
               corner and skids to a halt. Lyn is facing him, standing
               on one leg, hands raised above his head in an odd martial
               arts stance. He emits a threatening croon. Bob raises his
               hands nervously.

                         talk show.
               Lyn relaxes his martial arts stance, shakes his head
               ruefully.

                         Yup. That was Level Three.

                         Well...yeah, that was the goal.
                         But after a while we adapted it to
                         just finding a way of not being
                         seen. When you understand the, the
                         linkage between observation and
                         reality, you learn to dance with
                         invisibility.
               Bob tries to follow this.

                         It's not like camouflage. We also
                         practised Phasing. Crossing from
                         particle to wave, from the
                         physical realm to the plane of
                         energy. Solid objects seem to pass
                         right through you. It's starts
                         with a breathing exercise...
               Lyn makes a weird shallow PANTING SOUND.

                         Then you think black. That's the
                         nothingness.
               Bob watches him solemnly as he continues his weird
               panting.

                                       BOB
                         I don't...can I be honest, Lyn? I
                         don't know what to make of this. I
                         don't know what to say. This is

                         you...I wanna...could I write a
                         story about this?
               Lyn stops panting, takes a swig of whiskey, stares at the
               bottle, suddenly taciturn.

               They sit in silence for a moment. Lyn passes Bob the
               whiskey. He takes a swig, his mind whirring...

                         I was an American. I was Resolute.

                         wife. And to that one-armed cunt
                         Dave.
               Lyn is staring at Bob's notebook. He takes it from Bob
               and examines Bob's DRAWINGS OF EYES.

               Lyn examines Bob - something DIFFERENT IN HIS ATTITUDE.

               He considers for a moment, struggling with himself, then
               seems to reluctantly come to a decision. He reaches into
               the bag on his bed and pulls out a dog-eared BOOK. He
               hands it to Bob.
               Bob examines the book - on the cover is a picture of Da
               Vinci's Vitruvian Man and the title Pentagon Report
               92245. The New Earth Army Manual.
               Bob stares at the book. He opens the first page and

               Bill hits the ground, which is luckily mainly composed of
               MUD. He lies stunned as MORE HELICOPTERS lower around him
               and his PLATOON begin to debark. The Helicopters barely
               touch the ground before they take off again. SUPERED

               Bill gets up onto his knees and examines his M-16 - the
               barrel clogged with earth. He pokes his finger into the
               muzzle trying to clean it, then finds he can't get it
               back out again.

                                          BILL DJANGO
                            Oh, man...
               He tries to pull his finger free, glances up and FREEZES.
               Ahead of Bill and his Platoon is a WALL OF DEAD AMERICAN
               TROOPS - rotting in the sun.
               His men stand staring at the wall aghast. A PRIVATE
               beside Bill snaps and opens FIRE, yelling wildly.

               Bill grabs him with his free hand and shakes him, his M-
               16 hanging painfully from his other hand.

               THUNK. A SOLDIER standing next to Bill drops, the back of
               his head sprayed over nearby soldiers.

               SILENCE.
               Everyone stares at the dead man. Another shot rings out -
               another SOLDIER DROPS. The others flinch, scan the tree-
               line ahead of them.

               The Soldiers open fire - a deafening roar. The Woman
               keeps on running as the foliage above her head is
               shredded by bullets. NO SHOT COMES CLOSE. Bill watches
               amazed.

                            fired high. They instinctively
                            hadn't wanted to shoot another
                            person. Later Bill would come
                            across a study by General S.L.A
                            Marshall, which revealed that only
                            15-20 percent of fresh soldiers
                            shot to kill. The rest
                            aimed high, didn't fire at all, or
                            pretended to be busy doing
                            something else.
               Bullets still flying above her head, the Woman stops
               running, crouches down and RETURNS FIRE.
               Bill is SHOT, stumbles backwards and falls into the mud,
               his finger still stuck in his M-16. He lies there,
               staring up at the sky, his expression one of puzzlement,
               as a huge blood stain spreads over his chest.
               BILL'S P.O.V - the edges of our vision darken down as the
               sound FADES OUT. The darkness flows inwards, as if an

               LIGHT remains in the centre of the sky. We begin to move
               towards the light, slowly at first and then faster and
               faster. Just as we are about to reach it, a VISION OF THE
               FACE OF the VC WOMAN appears, filling the white disc.

                         What Bill hadn't told the Pentagon
                         was that he was really looking for
                         the answer to the riddle of his
                         vision. How could his men's
                         gentleness, their general lack of
                         interest in killing people, how
                         could this be turned into a
                         strength? How could love and peace
                         help win wars? Bill knew where to
                         go to find out.

                            Earth Army Manual.
               The Gates swing open and Bill passes through.

               Lyn crouches revolving a curious aluminium CONE towards
               the sun. Bob sits by the car, reading the manual. He
               looks up, watches Lyn.

                            The cone. Does it direct your
                            psychic powers or something?

                                            LYN CASSADY

               Lyn takes some BURGERS out of a cooler box and puts them
               into the cone.

               He examines the stove approvingly.

               Bob picks up the Manual and starts to read. Lyn watches
               him.

                         The New Earth Army was tasked with
                         preventing conflict. We're a force
                         of peace, not war. Bill realized

               He takes a yellow PLASTIC BLOB from his pocket with a

               Before he can finish Lyn has slipped Bob's finger into a
               hole in the middle of the blob and twisted it.

                         You see? You're mine now. The
                         Predator is completely
                         biodegradable. It's friendly to
                         the earth but it can hurt you in a
                         hundred ways.
               He takes the blob off the finger and rubs it's serrated
               edge down Bob's temple.

               Lyn sticks the Predator in Bob's ear and hauls him to his
               feet. Bob yells with pain.

                         I bought it on line. What's cool
                         about it is that you could see

               Lyn checks the meat on the stove looking pissed off. It's

                            Vietnam has crushed our soul. We
                            are traumatized and melancholic.
                            We are ashamed. That is why I have
                            brought you to this place of
                            Sanctuary. Here we can mend our
                            wounds and dream our dreams. My
                            dream is of an America that
                            will lead the world to paradise,
                            an America that no longer has an
                            exploitative view of natural
                            resources, that no longer promotes
                            consumption at all costs. I
                            believe this is America's destiny.

               Bill finishes. We TRACK along the OFFICERS' FACES -
               really not sure what to do or say. We reach one officer
               who looks like Lee Marvin. This is BRIGADIER GENERAL DEAN
               HOPGOOD. His eyes are shining with excitement.

                            Amongst Bill's audience that night
                            was Brigadier General Dean
                            Hopgood, from the Defense
                            Intelligence Agency. For some time
                            the General had been concerned
                            about information he had been
                            receiving about Soviet research
                            into psychic powers.

               Wearing trunks, the Brigadier General lounges by his

                            According to some stories the
                            Soviets were psychically
                            spying on American bases
                            and had designed "psychotronic
                            generators" - machines capable of
                            bombarding the President with
                            negative energy.

                            Well sir, it looks like they
                            heard about our attempt to
                            telepathically communicate with

                            There was no attempt, sir. It
                            seems the story was a French hoax.
                            But the Russians think the story
                            about the story being a French
                            hoax is just a story sir.

                            psi research, when in fact we

                Bob wakes, stiff and cold, in the front of the car. He
                sits up and looks around, trying to work out where he is.
                Suddenly he realizes he is ALONE. Afraid, he scans the
                landscape around him - featureless desert stretches to
                the horizon.

               He concentrates on the CLOUD again. Sure enough, it thins

               is pretty much the only vertical feature in the otherwise
               flat landscape.
               The two men stand staring at the wrecked front of the

               He tosses again.

                            Right. That's pretty...
               He stops, listening. We hear the sound of an approaching
               ENGINE. The two men turn to see a WHITE PICK-UP TRUCK
               approaching.

                                          BOB (CONT'D)

                            Oh thank Christ.
               Bob scuttles into the middle of the road, waving
               frantically. The pick-up slows and pulls over. A YOUNG
               IRAQI MAN looks out at them.

                                          BOB (CONT'D)
                            Can you help us? We drove into a
                            rock. Could you take us to a town
                            or someplace?
               Smiling, the Iraqi gestures to the back of the pick-up.

               He grabs his case and climbs up onto the back of the
               truck. Lyn stares at the driver, then, with a sigh picks
               up his bag and follows Bob.

               As the Truck bumps off down the road, Bob and Lyn sit
               down and find themselves facing TWO YOUNG IRAQI MEN.

                                          BOB
                            Hi! Hello there. Thanks so much
                            for this.
               The two Young Men smile in a friendly fashion.

                            much longer. Phew!
               One of the Young Men nods, smiling. He reaches casually
               forward and takes Lyn's BAG from him. Lyn just sits
               there, resigned as the Young Man roots through the
               contents.

                                          BOB (CONT'D)

                            huh?
               The Young Man takes out a ROCK COMPILATION CD from Lyn's
               bag and inspects it.

                                          YOUNG IRAQI

                            Purple? You like rock or, or...
               He suddenly notices the Young Iraqi is holding a HANDGUN.
               The Driver leans out the window and shouts something over
               the roar of the engine. The Young Man next to Lyn takes
               off his scarf and starts to blindfold Lyn with it.

               Bob and Lyn, their hands tied, sit on a mattress in the
               otherwise empty room, lit by a shaft of moonlight from
               the small window above them. From next door comes the
               faint sound of a period song playing. Bob is losing it.

               From the next room we hear the Young Iraqis start to sing
               along to the track, laughing. Lyn listens.

                            I don't think they're Al Qaeda.

                            Bob, there's something I have to
                            tell you. When I said I was
                            retired from the unit, that was a
                            lie. I'm on a mission. DeWitts was
                            just my cover. I've been
                            reactivated. I couldn't tell
                            you because this is a Black Op,
                            but...I think you have a part to
                            play. I think that's why you're
                            with me.
               Bob collapses face down on the mattress.

                            why I'm with you? Because I got
                            drunk. (Starting to cry a little)
                            I got drunk and I just wanted to
                            get into Iraq so I could prove to
                            my wife I wasn't...just once that
                            I...And now I'm going to die.

               He dissolves into misery. Lyn watches with sympathy.

               He unbuttons his shirt and reveals an EYE tattooed on his

               up.

                         You're missing the point.
                         (Standing up) Here let me show you
                         something. Stand up.
               Bob stands up reluctantly.

                         Choke me.

                                       BOB
                         Oh...I don't want to Lyn.

                         Choke me. What am I gonna do?
                         (pointing at his throat) Just
                         here. Choke. Choke.

                                       BOB
                         I don't think I...there's sharp
                         edges around here...

                         with his fingers) "Attack me."
               Bob stares at him, a little annoyed by this.

                                       BOB
                         What's with the quotation fingers?
                         That's like implying I'm you
                         know...only capable of ironic
                         attacking or...

                         Well, if I choose to choke you,
                         what are you going to do?

                                       LYN CASSADY
                         I'm going to interrupt your

               Bob thinks about this then raises his hands to choke Lyn.
               Lyn THROWS him - sailing through the air. He crashes
               down into the floor behind Lyn.

                         See? I hardly moved. Physics wise
                         there's not much going on. It's
                         the psychic energy that's

                         hand?
               Bob massages his back, impressed despite himself.

                                        BOB
                         Yes.

                                       LYN CASSADY
                         Would you say that level of fear
                         was abnormal for you?
               Bob thinks about this.

                                       BOB
                         I don't know. I was pretty
                         terrified anyway but the fear I
                         felt on the run-up to the choking
                         did seem, you know, unusual.

               in, smiling.

                            shit. Okay, what shall we do now?
               He stares around the men, expectantly.

                                          BILL DJANGO (CONT'D)

               The Jedis are DANCING to some rock, encouraged by Bill.

                                       BILL DJANGO
                         Okay! Give it everything you've
                         got! That's it!
               The Jedis start to dance more frenetically, eyes closed,
               jumping about the room, waving their arms...
               Bill notices Lyn, shuffling self-consciously from foot to
               foot.

                                       BILL DJANGO (CONT'D)
                         What's your name son?

                                       LYN CASSADY
                         Lyn Cassady sir.

                                       BILL DJANGO
                         Where you from?

                                       LYN CASSADY
                         Opelousas, Louisiana, sir.
               Bill stares at Lyn, taking in his orphan air, his hunted
               look.

                                       BILL DJANGO
                         Tough place to grow up?

          
               Lyn shrugs, embarrassed.   Bill nods.

                                       BILL DJANGO (CONT'D)
                         You've gotta free your feet before
                         you can free your mind, Lyn.

                                       LYN CASSADY

                              (EMBARRASSED)
                         Not much of a dancer sir.
               Bill examines Lyn's face through narrowed eyes.

                                       BILL DJANGO
                         But that isn't true is it Lyn? You
                         can dance. It's just someone told
                         you not to.

               A TWELVE YEAR OLD LYN - is dancing away to a track on
               the radio. His FATHER weaves drunkenly past the door and
               stops, watching.

               He throws his beer can at Lyn and walks on. Lyn stares
               after him, upset. The RADIO abruptly catches FIRE.

                            the dance out!
               Lyn starts to dance with a little more abandon.

                                           BILL DJANGO (CONT'D)
                            C'mon goddamit! DANCE! Let it go!
                            Let it all go!
               Lyn starts to go for it. And it's true - he CAN dance.

               The Jedi is BLINDFOLDED.

               The Jedis stare doubtfully at the bed of HOT COALS in
               front of them. One JEDI stands ready, his feet bare.

                         Okay, only when you're ready.
               The Jedi nods nervously, hesitates, starts to WALK ON THE
               COALS, almost immediately starts to SCREAM.

               music blasting - the men dancing in a variety of nerdish
               and demented ways. Their uniforms have been supplemented
               with odd, personal touches: hats, badges, sunglasses, a
               poncho...
               We find Lyn dancing in blissful, idiotic abandonment.

                            home. At last he was amongst men
                            who prided themselves on being

                            These were Golden Days for Lyn.
                            There was something so noble and
                            pure in Bill's vision that the
                            Jedis felt themselves inspired to
                            be more than soldiers. In a world
                            torn apart by greed and hate they
                            would be a force for good, for
                            peace.

               LARRY HOOPER.

               of the JEDI RECRUITS - is dancing, beaming with his new
               BRIDE. Guests - Lyn and the other Jedis amongst them -
               stand watching, clapping and cheering, a boisterous
               atmosphere of bonhomie. Larry watches the revellers with
               contempt.

                                          BOB (V.O.)
                            Right from the start he had made
                            himself unpopular with the other
                            Jedis.
               Scotty and his wife are walking off the dance floor.
               Larry stops him to shake his hand.

                                          LARRY HOOPER
                            Congratulations Scotty. I'm sorry
                            it doesn't work out for you two.
               Scotty's face falls. The other Jedis glare at Larry. One
               of them makes a move towards him but Lyn holds him back.

          

                                                                       53.

               The Jedis eat at one table. Larry sits alone and shunned
               at another table. Lyn walks over with a tray, hesitates
               seeing Larry alone.

                                       BOB (V.O.)
                         Larry made it quite clear that he
                         despised most of the other Jedis.
               Feeling sorry for him Lyn sits beside Larry. Larry
               flushes red.

                                       BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                         But Lyn - Lyn was different.
                         (Beat) He really hated Lyn.

          

          82   INT. PSI EXPERIMENT ROOM - DAY - THE PAST                 82

               Scotty, Larry and Lyn sit focusing on a wall of SMALL
               WOODEN CUPBOARDS. Each cupboard has a letter and number
               printed on its door.

                                        BILL DJANGO

                         A-9.
               The three men focus on the cupboard in question.

                                       SCOTTY
                         It's...it's something cylindrical?
                         I think it's a pencil?

                                        BILL DJANGO
                         Okay. Larry?
               Larry rolls his eyes up in his head, speaks in a high
               wavering voice with a bad cockney accent.

                                       LARRY HOOPER
                         This is Larry's Spirit Guide,
                         Maud. I'm looking into
                         the cupboard now and I'm
                         seeing...I'm seeing...a tin mug?

                                        BILL DJANGO
                         Lyn?
               Lyn stares at his hands, focused. He looks up suddenly,
               puzzled.

                                       LYN CASSADY
                         It's a man on a chair.
               Bill unlocks the little cupboard and takes a photograph
               of the Lincoln Memorial. There are murmurs of admiration
               from the watching Jedis.

                            said K, not A!
               Bill ignores him, smiles at Lyn.

                                          BILL DJANGO
                            Bravo Zulu, Lyn. Outstanding.
               Larry looks daggers at Lyn.

               Jedis watch, impressed.

               Bill is leading the Jedis in AIKIDO.

                                          BILL DJANGO
                            Aikido is a vehicle for
                            harmonizing ourselves with the
                            Universe and the Way. Look upon
                            these sessions as an opportunity
                            to discover yourself and your
                            training partner in a loving
                            environment.

               LATER
               Larry flails violently at Lyn. Lyn FLIPS him with ease.
               Larry gets up and CHARGES bellowing at Lyn who FLIPS him
               out of the frame. Bill joins Lyn.

                                           BILL DJANGO (CONT'D)

                            Notice how Lyn's circular motions
                            turned Larry's
                            aggression back upon him. Good
                            work Lyn.
               A CHAIR flies through the frame, just missing Lyn's head.

               Lyn lies on a couch drinking a beer, staring at a large
               BROWN ENVELOPE. Bill sits beside him with pad and paper.

               Lyn opens the envelope and stares at the PHOTOGRAPH of
               the NATO GENERAL inside.

                                          BOB (V.O.)
                            After a year's training, Lyn was
                            given his first tasking. A senior
                            Nato General had been kidnapped by
                            Red Brigade members in Italy. Bill
                            was unofficially
                            asked if his unit would be able to
                            help find him before it was too
                            late.

                            We're north of Verona. It's a
                            little town. There's a lake
                            nearby. I can see a Cinema. Across
                            from the Cinema is a shop or,
                            or...it's a cafe. He's in the
                            apartment above. The town is
                            called...it's something sweet.
                            (Beat) Dolce. It's called Dolce.
               Bill looks proudly over to where an important looking
               OFFICIAL watches from the next room. The Official looks
               impressed.

                                          BOB (V.O.)
                            It's true that the unit never
                            found out whether any of their
                            remote viewings were accurate or
                            not. Nevertheless from that moment
                            on Lyn's reputation soared.

                            Rank, medals...these things mean
                            little to the Jedi. But growth in
                            spirit, in wisdom, in psychic
                            power, these things earn our
                            respect.
               He presents Lyn with an EAGLE FEATHER.

                                          BILL DJANGO (CONT'D)
                            Native Americans believed that
                            when one received an Eagle
                            feather, it was the mark of love,
                            of gratitude and ultimate respect.
                            Only true Human Beings may carry
                            the Eagle feather.
               He gives the feather to a deeply moved Lyn, as the other
               Jedis applaud. Larry watches Lyn with HATE.

               Lyn lies on the couch, drinking another beer, the Eagle
               Feather on a chain around his neck. A period song is
               playing in the room.

                         The word soon got out in the
                         intelligence community that there
                         was a sergeant at Fort Bragg who
                         could find whatever you needed
                         found. It was as if Lyn could fly
                         anywhere in the world without
                         leaving his room.
               We TRACK INTO LYN'S EYE - UNTIL WE ARE INSIDE HIS MIND.
               LYN'S MIND P.O.V - We move towards the wall.

                         truly was strong with this one.
               As the song breaks into the chorus we burst through the
               wall, into freedom...

               Two MEN dressed in black with their kaffiyeh covering
               their faces stand by it staring at them. In the back seat
               of the Truck sits a blindfolded IRAQI MAN.
               The Driver of the Pick-Up crosses to the TWO INSURGENTS
               with a half-gallon bottle of WATER and passes it to them.
               They drink and confer briefly in Arabic. He turns and
               gestures to the other two Young Iraqis who push Lyn and
               Bob down from the back of the pick-up. Lyn stands still.

               The First Young Iraqi gestures more angrily at the Truck.

               One of the Insurgents stirs and says something softly in
               Arabic. The other laughs. Angrily the First Young Iraqi
               takes out a HANDGUN and levels it at Lyn.

               The Young Iraqi points the gun at Bob who starts to walk
               towards the truck.

               Bob stops.

                            We can go about our business.
               Apparently having had enough one the Insurgents pulls his
               own GUN out and aims at Lyn. The tension builds. Suddenly
               Bob remembers the phrase he was taught.

               Immediately everyone stares at Bob. The Insurgent OPENS
               FIRE at him.
               Terrified Bob, dives across the sand. The Young Iraqi
               behind him also scrambles for cover.
               Still firing, the Insurgent is suddenly aware of Lyn
               sprinting towards him. Before he can turn to aim at him,
               Lyn LEAPS into the air, spinning around, face contorted
               as he emits a bizarre SHRIEK.
               We FREEZE-FRAME ON HIM, HUNG IN MID-AIR.

                         Now at the time I thought Lyn was
                         having some kind of fit here.
                         Later I discovered what he was
                         actually doing was performing the
                         Echmeyer technique.

               CLOSE on a man who looks like WOODY ALLEN in a jungle
               hat. He has his eyes closed in IMMENSE CONCENTRATION. A
               bead of sweat runs down his face. SUPERED TITLES read:

                         Ben Echmeyer was a Vietnam vet
                         with sixty-three confirmed kills.
                         He remains the only non-Korean to
                         achieve the rank of Master in Kwa
                         Ra Do. He was one of the Jedi

                         It was said he could have a tug of
                         war with a dozen men and not move
                         an inch.
               We PAN DOWN the back of BEN and find he is NAKED from the
               waist down. A SAND BAG is somehow hanging between his
               legs.

                         He was also able to lift bags of
                         sand on hooks hung through his
                         scrotum.

               We hear the sound of an approaching engine.

                            be his undoing.
               Next second a JEEP roars straight over Ben, going at
               sixty miles an hour.
               We FREEZE FRAME on the JEEP.

               Ben leaps spastically in the air, spinning and shrieking,
               a knife held in one hand.

                            The approach was hailed by some
                            knife aficionados as revolutionary
                            but criticized by others who
                            believed that the leaping and
                            spinning might lead you to
                            accidentally stab yourself.

               We UN-FREEZE ON LYN - as he whirls and shrieks towards
               the Insurgent. Bob watches amazed from where he lies on
               the sand.

                                       BOB (V.O.)
                         Of course, Lyn didn't actually
                         have a knife with him at this
                         particular time...so I still think
                         what he did was kinda...reckless.
               The Insurgent, understandably startled, flinches
               backwards, trips over the water bottle and falls on his
               ass.
               Lyn scoops up the gallon bottle of water and begins to
               POUND the fallen man with it. The Young Iraqi moves to
               intervene but Lyn smacks him in the face with the bottle.
               The BLINDFOLDED IRAQI IN THE TRUCK manages to open the
               door and stumbles out, claws his blindfold off and races
               away over the sand.
               The second Insurgent is distracted for a moment by his
               victim's flight. When he turns back Lyn has scooped up
               the Insurgent's GUN and is aiming it at him.
               Beat. Nobody moves.

               The sun is rising as the PICK-UP TRUCK roars over the
               sand and swerves onto the road.

               INSIDE THE TRUCK
               Lyn drives. Bob is leaning out of the window, staring at
               the road behind them.

               The Truck crests a hill and we see the IRAQI MAN running
               desperately down the road ahead of us, his hands tied.

                         There he is.
               He puts his foot down and the truck roars after the
               running man.

               him.

                            We're here to help you!
               Terrified the Man sprints faster. Lyn tries to pass him,
               but the Man veers at the same time and the truck CLIPS
               him, sending him flying.

               Lyn runs over to where the MAN lies moaning on the road,
               his head bleeding.

               Bob gets out and the two lift the Iraqi Man and begin to
               carry him back towards the truck.
               They stop listening to an approaching rumble.

               They scuttle faster back towards the truck, the Iraqi Man
               dangling between them.
               Next second, two GLEAMING WHITE SUVs crest the hill and
               roar towards them. Seeing the road blocked by the truck,
               the SUVs screech to a halt and several MEN IN FLAK
               JACKETS AND SUNGLASSES tumble out in formation, aiming
               their M-16's at Lyn and Bob.

               Tigress and Euphrates towards a GLEAMING CITY rising from

               Bob and the Iraqi Man sit beside TODD NIXON - a suit. Lyn
               sits behind in between two of the PRIVATE SECURITY
               GUARDS, who are nodding along to the music playing in the
               car.
               Nixon, holding the LAPTOP for Bob to see, watches the
               screen, moved.

                            time I see it, it gets me.
               He glances over at the Iraqi Man who is holding a
               dressing to the cut on his forehead, pale and shaken.

               aiming them at the cars which swerve out of their way in

               A LONG line of cars are waiting for gas - Iraqi men,
               women and children, suffering in the heat. Many of them
               have been there for hours. The SUVs approach.

               ...as the two SUV's roar up, horns blaring, M-16's
               bristling from the windows. The lead SUV rams the car at
               the head of the line and sweeps it out of its path.
               Nixon's SUV barrels through the gap and screeches to a
               halt by the pumps. The THREE SECURITY MEN roll out
               showily, machine guns ready.

               The men fan out to the corners of the station, while the
               first SUV blocks the road and more SECURITY pile out,
               guns raised to cover the line of cars. There are howls of
               protest from the waiting Iraqis.
               Inside the SUV Bob, Lyn and Mahmud watch in astonishment.

                same flak-jackets and Oakley sunglasses but different
                color uniforms.

                             We are under attack. This is a
                             FUBAR situation. Requesting Kiowa!
                Behind him Lyn, Bob and Mahmud crawl across the station
                on their hands and knees, bullets zipping past them.

                Mahmud leads Bob and Lyn at a crouching run down the
                street, amongst the crowd of Iraqis fleeing the gunfire
                behind them. We hear the whup-whup of a helicopter as a
                Kiowa Warrior passes over head.
                Moments later we hear an EXPLOSION as the helicopter
                opens fire with a MISSILE...

                TRACKING along a wall, past a crooked WEDDING PORTRAIT -
                a smiling Mahmud and WIFE, the glass broken...

                             it turned out had been robbed in
                             his absence.
                We TRACK past a row of BULLET HOLES in the wall, a
                section of smoke damaged wall paper.

                             by a US tank. Neighbors told him
                             his wife had
                             left, they weren't sure where she
                             had gone.
                We reach Bob, Lyn and Mahmud eating at a low table. The
                windows behind them have been partially boarded up.
                Mahmud is sunk into a profound depression. Lyn looks
                tired, pale. They eat in awkward silence.

                                             LYN CASSADY
                             What is this?

                             They're really good.
                Bob nods politely. Mahmud nods, sighs.

                                           BOB (V.O.)
                             I understood he was going     through
                             a lot, but considering we     had
                             saved him from kidnappers     I still
                             thought his welcome could     have
                             been a little warmer.
                Lyn clears his throat.

                                           LYN CASSADY
                             I'm very sorry for running you
                             over, sir.
                Mahmud shrugs.

                             It was an accident.

                             detachment. Please don't think all
                             Americans are like that.
                Mahmud nods. Beat.

                          Not your fault sir. I mean we get
                          kidnappers in America too,
                          so...you know. There's always, uh,
                          bad apples, right?
                The men eat in silence for a moment. Mahmud stares
                blankly at his plate, looking crumpled and lost. Bob
                watches him, faintly irritated. Lyn tries to think of
                something comforting to say.

                          last of your sorrows.)
                Mahmud looks at him, startled perhaps by the unexpected
                Arabic phrase.

                                        LYN CASSADY (CONT'D)
                          Did I say it wrong?
                Mahmud shakes his head, moved but embarrassed.

                                        MAHMUD DAASH
                          No...that was right.

                Lyn and Bob are sharing a bed. Bob looks out of the
                window and notices a CLOUD over the moon. He concentrates
                on it, trying to "bust" it. Nothing happens. He sighs,
                looks over to Lyn who is staring at the wall, lost once
                more in dark thoughts.

                          Lyn was thinking of Larry Hooper
                          and the part he had played in the
                          destruction of the New earth Army.
                          But, in fairness, the Jedis' own
                          eccentricities hadn't exactly won
                          them many allies in the Army.
                A JEDI - TIM KOOTZ - lies on the couch in a TRANCE, Bill
                sitting beside him with pen and paper.

                          For example, there was Tim Kootz
                          who, on being asked to ascertain
                          the whereabouts of General Manuel
                          Noriega, had replied...
                Tim jerks awake from his trance.

                             Larry had been doing research into
                             the infamous CIA MK-ULTRA
                             experiments which he believed
                             could enhance his own psychic

                             safe.
                Larry, making sure Norm can't see, is pouring a massive

                Norm lies tripping on the couch, rigid, wide-eyed,
                wearing headphones, connected to the electronic device,
                which emit disturbing electronic frequencies.
                Larry stands at the light switch, turning the red bulb
                overhead on and off, eagerly watching Norm's reaction - a
                modern day Frankenstein.

                GUNSHOTS fill the room. Norm's NAKED LEGS stride past
                him.

                A NAKED AND DEMENTED NORM walks through the base, firing
                random shots at scattering soldiers with his Beretta. He
                finds Bill blocking his way.

                Norm starts to cry. Then he puts the gun into his
                mouth...

                             nothing could be proved and when

                The OFFICIALS listening register shock and dismay. Bill
                stands up, outraged.

                Bill, a broken man, is walking off the base. He reaches
                the gates and sees Lyn waiting for him.

                             ever.
                Lyn can't speak. Bill hugs him and walks off, the gates
                closing after him.

                The Jedis sit having their hair shaved with electric
                clippers. The Jedi's NEW COMMANDER - MAJOR HOLTZ - not a
                shred of New Age sympathy in his regulation heart - walks
                down the line, examining his men coldly.

                the floor.

                Bob wakes up, listening to the sound of Lyn's laboured
                breathing.
                Across the room Lyn sits, sweating with pain, preparing
                an injection. We see he has used the LAST OF THE
                MEDICINE. He injects himself, his breathing beginning to
                ease and sits staring at the empty VIAL. Bob watches for
                a moment then shuts his eyes, feigning sleep.

                Lyn and Bob are waiting on the quiet road which is
                studded with burnt out CARS.
                Mahmud drives an old Renault out of a warehouse and over
                to them. He gets out the car and hands Lyn the keys.

                stands in the middle of the road, staring at his feet.
                They drive on.

                Lyn sits staring out at the emptiness, looking, perhaps
                for the first time, worried.

                Below us the car drives off into the empty landscape,
                getting smaller and smaller. Then...
                BOOM. We see the flash of the explosion and the Renault
                is flipped like a toy car. A ribbon of black smoke rises
                into the blue sky. Silence.

                BOB's P.O.V - We are stumbling forward towards a sand
                berm. We hear the sound of heavy breathing.

                                           BOB (O.S.)

                                  (CROAKING)
                             What...what happened?
                Lyn is staggering over the sand with Bob on his back. He
                is holding his backpack. Bob has a gash on his forehead
                which is bleeding. Under the blood his face is white. In
                the distance, behind them, we can see the column of black
                smoke rising.

                                              LYN CASSADY

                             Oh Jesus.

                                           LYN CASSADY
                             You're okay Bob. It's gonna be
                             okay.

                                           BOB
                             I can't believe this. Great
                             fucking intuition Lyn. I
                             can't...put me down. I can walk.
                             Put me down.
                Lyn puts Bob down. Bob keels sideways onto the sand and
                lies there, wheezing.

                                           BOB (CONT'D)
                             Oh, Jeez. Oh, Jeez.

                             Alright, c'mon...
                He hauls Bob to his feet, puts his baseball cap on him
                and pulls him onto his back. Bob hangs there limply as
                Lyn sets off again.

                Lyn reaches up and gropes at Bob's face, removing his
                spectacles. Bob doesn't notice.

                                           BOB
                             Where are we going? We should stay
                             with the car so the army can find
                             us.

                             Fedayeen will find us first.

                             Well, I disagree. I totally
                             disagree.(Beat) The Federal what?

                             Fellas who probably laid the IED.
                             They could be on their way now.
                             Hold this Bob.
                He passes Bob his backpack. They stagger on in silence
                for a moment, Bob jogging up and down on Lyn's back. Lyn
                snaps the legs off Bob's glasses, uses them as improvised
                divining rods to scan the sand ahead.

                                           BOB

                             here. I'm checking for
                             disturbances in the telluric
                             current.

                             Are they my glasses?
                Lyn doesn't answer, keeps on walking, struggling a little
                under the weight. Beat.

                                           BOB (CONT'D)
                             Jesus, it's hot. I'm so hot.

                             keep your mouth closed, okay? You
                             can lose a lot of water through an
                             open mouth.
                He staggers on with him.

                Bob trails after Lyn, his shirt tied around his head,
                breathing hard. Lyn is still scanning the sand.

                He staggers, manages not to fall.

                          You're not bleeding to death, Bob.
                          It's shock, okay? It's just the
                          shock. It'll pass. You're gonna be

                          heart's gonna stop.
                Bob stares after him incredulously.

                Lyn walks on without answering. Bob notices the sun is
                sinking.

                Bob stares at him, stunned.

                Lyn sits staring up at the immense MOON above them.
                Bob sits watching, huddled against the cold, in the
                shelter of some rocks. Lyn gets up, stumbles back over to
                him and lies down, struggling for breath, white with
                pain.

                                        LYN CASSADY
                          It's gone Bob. I can't find him.
                          I've lost my power. It's the
                          curse.

                          They took this... beautiful thing
                          we'd been building and they
                          corrupted it. They destroyed the

                             love and peace is most certainly
                             not the business of the Army. So
                             you girls better start thinking
                             about how you CAN engage in the

                Larry stands to attention in front of Holtz, a REPORT
                held under one arm.

                                           BOB (V.O.)
                             Major Holtz regarded Larry Hooper
                             as a patriotic whistle-blower and
                             the one sound fruit in an
                             otherwise dubious barrel of
                             apples.

                             It's some scientific research I've
                             done for possible offensive psi
                             applications sir. (Beat) I did
                             show the report to Lieutenant
                             Colonel Django, but he didn't seem
                             interested.
                Holtz snorts angrily.

                                                                  (CONTINUED)

                He takes the report and begins to look through it. Pause.
                He looks up slowly at Larry.

                                           MAJOR HOLTZ (CONT'D)
                             We have men who can do this?

                Holtz ponders the report, tempted.

                             But we don't have the resources.

                The building we saw at the top of the film. A hundred
                GOATS stare silently at us.

                                           BOB (V.O.)
                             Goat Lab was originally created as
                             a clandestine laboratory to
                             provide in-the-field surgical
                             training for Special Forces
                             soldiers.
                We BOOM down to reveal that many of the goats have their
                legs in PLASTER.

                                           BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                             The goats would get shot in the
                             leg with a bolt gun and then a
                             trainee would have to dress the
                             wound successfully. Goat lab
                             actually used to be called Dog
                             Lab...

                             didn't feel good shooting dogs in
                             the leg...

                Lyn STARES. One of the goats STARES BACK. Lyn STARES. The
                goat STARES BACK. Lyn STARES.
                And the Goat falls over.

                          This was the real deal, Bob. I was

                          So, it's not that the goat fought

                             again. Only this time they
                             said...kill the goat.

                             There was no way! What had the
                             goat ever done to me? It was
                             totally against the way of the
                             Jedi. I was just going to pretend
                             to try so they would say, "okay -
                             it can't be done" and forget about
                             it. But then, as I sat there, I
                             felt this, this pulse start inside
                             of me and...I couldn't stop it.
                He turns to look at Bob, haunted.

                Grainy, flickering black and white footage of the six
                goats in the room. Suddenly one of them goes down.

          

          143   INT. ABANDONED HOSPITAL - LYN'S ROOM - THE PAST          143

                A soldier runs into the room. Holtz, Hooper and Lyn turn
                to him, the atmosphere electric with dread and
                anticipation.

                                           SOLDIER

                             The goat is dead.
                The three men stare at him.

                             it. I'd used my powers for evil
                             and it was like I brought a curse
                             upon us all. Like that poem where
                             the guy kills the seagull and they
                             make him wear it round his neck.
                             Every night
                             I'd dream of that goat in its
                             little bib, it's mouth opening and
                             closing but nothing coming out...
                Bob shakes his head, stares out into the darkness.

                             The silence of the goats.
                Lyn flicks a suspicious glance at Bob, but is reassured
                by his solemn expression.

                                           LYN CASSADY
                             I finished my tour and I quit. I
                             walked out of the unit and I never
                             went back.

                Lyn, wearing civilian clothes and holding a suitcase, is
                walking off the base. He reaches the gates and turns for
                one last look at the place that has been his home.

                                           BOB (V.O.)
                             But before he could leave Larry
                             arranged one last parting gift.
                Lyn tuns back to the gates and finds Larry Hooper
                standing in front of him, looking WIRED.

                                           LYN CASSADY
                             What do you wan...?
                Before he can finish Larry CHOPS his hand down in an odd
                blow onto Lyn's forehead. Lyn staggers back a little,
                holding his head.

                                              LYN CASSADY (CONT'D)
                             What the hell?
                Larry has already darted around him with a crazy laugh
                and is running madly back into the base. Lyn stares after
                him, stunned.

                                           LYN CASSADY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                             It was the Dim Mak.

                Bob looks at Lyn, puzzled.

                             The Dim Mak?

                             was forbidden in the New Earth

                             Jesus.

                                            LYN CASSADY
                             There's a story that Wong Wifu,
                             great Chinese martial artist, had
                             a fight with some guy and had him
                             beat when the guy gave him this
                             light tap, and Wong looked at him
                             and the guy just nodded. That was
                             it. He'd given him the death touch
                             and Wong died.

                                           BOB
                             Then and there?

                                           LYN CASSADY
                             No. Eighteen years later. That's
                             the weird thing with Dim Mak - you
                             never know when it's going to take
                             effect.
                He flops back, too tired to talk anymore. Bob watches him
                as he falls asleep.

                                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

          

          147   EXT. DESERT - MORNING                                      147

                The same horizon, the dunes now burning under the sun. We
                TRACK back and find Bob and Lyn lying asleep, lips
                cracked, dehydrated, exhausted. Faintly we hear a sound -
                a tinny BELL. It gets closer. Groggily Bob opens his eyes
                just as a GOAT walks into the frame and walks past him,
                the bell tied around its neck. Bob lies, watching it
                pass, trying to work out if it's a hallucination. He
                struggles to his feet and sets off up the berm he's been
                lying at the foot of.
                The goat walks on ahead of Bob, crests the top of the
                berm and disappears from sight.
                Bob reaches the top of the berm and stands, swaying,
                staring down at something.
                CLOSE ON BOB'S FACE - stunned.

          

                                                                        89.

                Bob is dragging a barely conscious Lyn up the berm,
                following the goat. He staggers, barely able to put one
                foot in front of the other.
                At last we crest the top of the berm and find ourselves
                looking down on a WATER-HOLE, fringed with palms. The
                goat stands drinking. It stops to look up at us.

          

          149   EXT. WATER-HOLE - DAY                                    149

                Bob and Lyn collapse into the wet mud of the hole. Bob
                manages to cup some water into Lyn's mouth and then his
                own. He rolls onto his back, stares up at the burning
                sky.
                We hear a dull roaring, muffled, growing in volume. A
                HELICOPTER is approaching...

                                                                   FADE OUT.
                In the BLACK we hear a VOICE.

                OVERHEAD SHOT - Lyn and Bob lie side by side in beds,
                both hooked up to IV's. Sunlight slants through the
                shutters on the window in the cool room. The voice is
                coming from a SPEAKER on the wall.

                Lyn opens his eyes, looks around him.

                Lyn looks at the door and for a second there's a FLASH OF
                A FACE staring in through the glass. Then it's gone.

                Over the speaker comes the sound of a period song.
                Lyn sits up, staring at the door. Bob stirs in his bed.

                Lyn walks unsteadily out of the room, towing his IV drip
                behind him.
                The door at the end of the corridor is just CLOSING. Lyn
                sets off down the corridor. Bob appears in the doorway
                behind him, towing his own IV.

                Lyn passes doors, glances into the rooms beyond...
                LYN'S P.O.V - the room seems to house a PRINTING PRESS. A
                SOLDIER stands with his back to us, watching LEAFLETS
                fire out of the press.
                We pass to the next room which seems to be a RECORDING
                STUDIO - the walls covered in shelves of CD's. A SOLDIER
                sits with headphones on playing an electronic keyboard...

          

          153   EXT. ARMY BASE BUILDING - DAY                            153

                Lyn emerges blinking into the light. He stares around
                him. The song is playing over speakers, echoing eerily
                around the base.
                A door slides shut with a clang nearby and Lyn turns to
                locate the sound.
                A trail of FOOTPRINTS leads across the sand to a HANGAR
                nearby.
                Lyn heads off across the sand, dragging the IV. Bob
                emerges behind him.

                Lyn reaches the sliding doors of the building and drags
                them open and stands staring into the gloomy interior.
                Bob catches him up.

                             I don't think we should...
                He stops following Lyn's gaze...

                INSIDE THE BUILDING
                The place is full of GOATS.
                Lyn and Bob stare at the animals. Slowly Lyn advances
                into the darkness, peering around him.
                In the shadows at the back of the building a figure
                STIRS. Lyn walks slowly forward until he can make out the
                man - old, bearded, worn and wasted by years of heavy
                drinking. It's BILL DJANGO.
                Lyn stares at him.

                             Hello Bill.
                Bill smiles hesitantly.

                                             BILL DJANGO
                             Hello Lyn.
                Lyn is too choked with emotion for a moment to answer.

                             This is Bob.

                             Hello Bob.
                Bob is too amazed to reply.

                                             LARRY HOOPER (O.S.)
                             Oh good...
                Bob and Lyn turn to find Larry Hooper standing in the
                doorway behind them.

                                           LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D)

                Bob picks up a LEAFLET.

                Lyn is staring at Bill who is looking a little vacantly
                at the racks of CD's. Larry notices.

                          Bill's been looking into

                Bob helps Lyn down the corridor. Lyn suddenly stops,
                listening. There is a faint sound of MUSIC coming from
                somewhere nearby.

                Lyn walks down the corridor, Bob following. At the end of
                the corridor is a single door with a SPY-HOLE. The loud
                music is coming from there. We can hear now that it is an
                annoying children's show song or heavy metal.
                We TRACK towards the door...
                Lyn hesitates then slides back the SPY-HOLE cover and
                peers in.

                LYN'S P.O.V -
                An IRAQI PRISONER sits huddled in the cell, illuminated
                in the flashes of a powerful STROBE LIGHT OVERHEAD.

                music the whole scene is horribly sinister.
                Lyn steps away from the spy-hole.

                Bill takes a long drink, stares at the sky. Bob watches
                him with mounting frustration.

                                           BOB (CONT'D)
                             You know, he told me all these
                             stories about Bill Django, and I
                             was pretty excited to meet you,
                             but I've gotta tell you...you're
                             one big disappointment.
                Bill doesn't react. Bob starts to walk away then turns
                back, and throws the FEATHER down at Bill's feet.

                                           BOB (CONT'D)
                             He told me to give you that back.
                             I don't know why. Its supposed to
                             be a mark of honour isn't it? I
                             don't see how you deserve that.

                cloud, focuses, desperate, hopeful...
                Bill notices and watches, curious.
                Slowly, the cloud fades and DISAPPEARS.

                          were coming over here, asked him

                             I know. He's had an idea.

          

          165   INT. CORRIDOR/KITCHEN - NIGHT                              165

                Bill and Bob head down the corridor. They pass a SOLDIER.

                                           SOLDIER

                                  (SALUTING)
                             Good evening sir.

                                           BILL DJANGO

                             Getting some ice-cream.
                They walk on and reach the doors to the KITCHENS. The two
                men hesitate, look at each other...
                Then Bob walks in.

          

          166   INT. BASE - CANTEEN - MORNING                              166

                PSIC WORKERS AND PSYOPS TROOPS are all eating breakfast
                together, talking, laughing.
                Bob and Bill sit drinking coffee. Lyn appears with a tray
                and sits down beside Bob.

          

          

          

                                                                    (CONTINUED)

          

                                                                            101.

                They eat in silence for a moment. Lyn turns to look out
                of the window to where Larry Hooper stands outside in the
                early morning sun, smoking a cigar and drinking coffee.
                He turns and notices Lyn, raises his cup, smiles. Lyn
                looks troubled. Bob suddenly leans into Lyn.

                                           BOB

                                  (SOFTLY)
                             Don't eat the jello.
                Lyn turns to Bob puzzled.

                             What?

                                           BOB
                             Don't eat the jello.
                Lyn tries to puzzle this out but is distracted by Larry
                outside who seems to have noticed something in the sand
                at his feet - a small insect of some kind. He begins to
                watch it with strange fascination. After a moment he
                sinks to his knees in order to get a better look at it.
                One of the SOLDIERS notices and starts to laugh softly.
                His neighbor looks at him as if he's crazy then begins to
                laugh himself. Lyn looks around him, sensing the strange
                atmosphere creeping through the room.

                                           LYN CASSADY
                             What's going on?

                                           BOB
                             We put LSD in the jello.
                Lyn turns to stare at him.

                                              LYN CASSADY
                             What?

                                           BOB
                             Bill showed me where Larry had
                             bottles of LSD. So we put it in
                             the jello mix last night.

                             And in the water.
                Bob turns to stare at him.

                                              BOB
                             What?

                             I put it in the main water tank as
                             well.

                Bob stares at him, aghast.

                                        BOB
                          But...we've drunk the water.

                He pours himself another coffee.

                Through the window we see Larry get on his belly to get a
                better look at the bug.

          

          167   INT. RADIO STATION - MORNING                               167

                The DJ SOLDIER has gone off script. A PRODUCER is trying
                ineffectually to pull him away from the desk.

                                         ARMY BROADCASTER

                          I'm guessing. I mean, I haven't
                          looked at the, the thing but I'd
                          say it's going to be fucking HOT!
                          Hot. Hot. Hot.
                The Producer pulls and releases the DJ's headphones so
                they slap against his head and starts giggling.

                CLOSE on a LOUDSPEAKER - blasting a period song out over
                the base. We BOOM down to where two SOLDIERS are dancing,
                tripping.

                ALL OVER THE BASE
                Soldiers are wandering around, talking, some falling to
                their knees, weak with laughter. Some stand alone,
                staring with a beatific smile at the sky.

          

          

                                                                    (CONTINUED)

                As the music plays on a STRYKER ARMORED VEHICLE drives
                around the corner of a building, a SOLDIER standing up,
                arms raised, in the gun turret.
                The Stryker screeches into a clumsy skid, the Soldier
                having to hang on. The Stryker roars off again, heading
                straight for the GATES of the base.

                                           SOLDIER
                                  (calling down into

                             You're going to hit the gates.
                             You're going to hit the gates.
                The Stryker veers left and smashes through the perimeter
                fence and out into the desert.

                desk, laughing.

                             Don't you think it might have been
                             more sensible if we hadn't drunk
                             the fucking water?

                                           BILL DJANGO
                             That might have aroused suspicion.
                             But don't worry. Over the years I
                             have built up a massive tolerance
                             to all narcotics.

                An IRAQI PRISONER looks up startled as the door to the
                cell is flung open and Bill stands, filling the doorway,
                bare-chested, wild-eyed and wild-haired.

                the goats out into the light.

                As the music continues Bob, Lyn and Bill appear leading a
                column of nervous IRAQI PRISONERS out of the building,
                towards the gates. Lyn and Bill are holding BABY GOATS in
                their ARMS. A tripping Bob is holding bunches of flowers -
                it's as close as they can get to the illustration from
                the New Earth Army Manual. Lyn holds up a hand to stop
                the procession.
                Larry stands in front of them, a GUN in his hand, his
                face blank.
                Lyn and Larry stare at each other. Then, unexpectedly,
                Larry starts to cry.

                          Give me the gun Larry.
                Larry starts to raise the gun to his mouth. Pauses.
                Scratches his head.

                                        LARRY HOOPER

                One by one the Iraqis walk out through the broken fence,
                staring around them suspiciously, expecting a trap.
                Nothing happens, no one shoots them.

                The Iraqis start to hurry away over the sand.
                Beyond them we can the Stryker, driving in circles in the
                desert, a NAKED SOLDIER stands whooping on top.

                Bob, tripping heavily, is staring with fascination at the
                sand trickling through his fingers. Suddenly we hear the
                building whine of the HELICOPTER engine starting up. Bob
                looks up, puzzled.

          

          176   HELICOPTER                                               176
                Bill and Lyn sit in the chopper, Bill at the controls.
                Lyn is holding the flowers.
                Bob appears, hurrying over.

                                           BOB

                                  (CALLING)
                             Wait! Wait for me! Where are you
                             going...what about the mission?

                                           LYN CASSADY
                                  (Over the sound of
                                   the engine)
                             You are the mission Bob! You are
                             the mission! Tell them what
                             happened!
                The helicopter begins to rise. Bob stands swaying,
                staring up. Lyn smiles sadly through the window, raises
                his hand.
                The Helicopter RISES - HIGHER AND HIGHER. Bob waves
                goodbye.

                                           BOB (V.O.)
                             At the time I was hurt that Lyn
                             hadn't taken me with him. But now
                             I know it was because he and Bill
                             had already seen what was to come.

          

                                                                         106.

                As the helicopter flies off into the blue.

                                        BOB (V.O.)
                          Nobody knows exactly what
                          happened. The official
                          story is that their helicopter
                          must have crashed, either because
                          they were hit by an RPG or
                          because...well, that's what
                          happens when you fly a helicopter
                          while you're tripping on acid. All
                          I know is they've never been seen
                          since. Like all Shaman they
                          returned to the sky.
                The helicopter disappears altogether.

                                                                DISSOLVE TO:

                concentration.

                          When I got back home I wrote the
                          story up. Everything.

                Bob sits in his car staring at his old home, across the
                road. Through the window we can see Bob's ex-wife Debora,
                eating dinner with Bob's ex-Editor - Dave.

          

                                        BOB (V.O.)
                          I sent it to the newspapers, the
                          radio stations, the TV stations,
                          because that was what Lyn wanted
                          me to do. The people needed to
                          know.

                Bob sits watching a Today style show on TV.

          

                                        BOB (V.O.)
                          I was ready for whatever they
                          would do to me. I was ready to
                          disappear. I was ready to go to
                          prison. I was a Jedi and I was
                          fighting for the New Earth Army.

                             prison. They did something much
                             worse.

                             using what some are calling a
                             cruel and unusual tool to break
                             the resistance of Iraqi POWs, and
                             many parents would agree! Some
                             prisoners are being forced to

                Bob is working for another small town newspaper. He sits
                at his desk, staring fixedly ahead at the wall.

          

                                           BOB (V.O.)
                             That was it. That was the only bit
                             of my story that ran anywhere. And
                             it was a joke. And if I ever
                             needed proof of how the Dark Side
                             have taken the beautiful dream of
                             what a nation could be and had
                             twisted it, destroyed it, that was
                             it.

          
                Bob stands up. He starts to walk down the office, his
                face set with grim determination.

                             But I won't stop. I won't give up.
                Bob quickens his pace.

                                           BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                             Because when I look at what is
                             happening in the world, I know
                             that now, more than ever, we need
                             to become ALL that we can BE.
                Bob is running.

                Bob rushes towards the WALL. Just as he is about to hit
                it we FREEZE FRAME. We hear the opening of a period song.
