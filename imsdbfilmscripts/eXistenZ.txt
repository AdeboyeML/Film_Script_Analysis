          INT. COUNTRY CHURCH - NIGHT

          The man facing us is bearded, sweating, intense,'joyous.
          Jacket and tie, jeans, fortyish. His name is Wittold Levi.
          eXistenZ.
          Levi turns to a chalkboard on a tripod and writes the word.

                         LEVI
          Written like this. One word.
          Small e. Capital X, capital Z.
          He turns back to face an as-yet-unseen audience.

                         LEVI
          eXistenZ. It's new, it's from
          Antenna Research, and it's here,
          right now.
          We now see Levi's audience, about seventy-five people, some
          standing, some sitting on plastic folding chairs. They are
          of very mixed age and type, but they all cheer and applaud
          enthusiastically.
          We are in the central playing area of a small, deconsecrated
          country church, and Levi performs on a broad, low, carpeted
          plywood dais. At the far end of the dais, a man and a woman
          - assistants to Levi - are carefully laying out about two
          dozen plastic modules that look somewhat like high-tech ski
          boots.

                         LEVI
          My name is Wittold Levi, my
          friends call me Witt - and I'm
          the project manager for eXistenZ.
          I recognize some familiar faces -
          that's all right, that's all
          right. We won't throw you out. We
          encourage consumer loyalty, and
          we want you to help us with our
          product testing. We're a team,
          Antenna and you.
          A delighted stir from the crowd.

                         LEVI
          Those of you who have come to our
          invited seminars before will know
          that I normally lead the group
          through our new games, but

          tonight, it won't be me. No, for
          the test launch of eXistenZ by
          Antenna, we have brought you a
          seminar leader who is rather
          special.
          An unbelieving, excited stir. Could it really be?

                         LEVI
          Yes, it is. The world's greatest
          game designer is here, in person,
          to lead you, the first test
          enclave, through her newest
          creation, eXistenZ by Antenna...
          The small crowd is now tremendously excited, wide-eyed,
          murmuring, one or two have actually gotten on their knees.

                         LEVI
          I give you, the Game-Pod Goddess
          herself - Allegra Geller!
          Levi moves to the edge of the crowd, works his way into it
          until he has reached a small, unobtrusive figure who up to
          now has hardly been noticed. She stands next to a security
          guard who is dressed in a suit and tie but carries an
          electronic wand of some sort. His name-tag identifies him as
          Ted Pikul (rhymes with "Michael", not with "pickle"), and we
          will see more of him later.
          As Levi takes her hand and gently leads her out of the
          crowd, her fans applaud softly, touch her hem. They part
          like water as she passes amongst them, clutching her own
          personal game-pod case with both hands. She mounts the dais
          like a blind person led by her seeing-eye dog.
          Allegra Geller, early thirties, conservatively dressed, is
          bright, acutely aware, but wary and controlled. When she
          speaks, she is deliciously, sexily shy, serious, melodic.

                         GELLER
          The world of games is in a kind
          of a trance. People are
          programmed to accept so little,
          but the possibilities are so
          great.

          tonight, we were going to test a

          at least, not in the usual sense.
          Confused, slightly disappointed mutterings.

                         GELLER
          No, no, it's going to be much
          better than you expected, because
          eXistenZ is not just a game. It's
          an entirely new game system.
          Antenna Research and I developed
          it together - the eXistenZ System
          by Antenna - and it involves a
          whole lot of new toys, which you
          are going to be the first to try
          out.
          The crowd's spirit rises again. Levi steps forward, smiling,
          playing off the renewed energy.

                         LEVI
          MetaFlesh.
          Levi turns to the chalkboard and writes the word.

          - the MetaFlesh Game-Pod, only
          from Antenna Research. It
          connects with any industry
          standard bioport, which I know
          you all have or you wouldn't be

          Levi writes the word out and then turns back to his by-now-
          salivating audience.

          But I never had anything quite so
          fun or so revolutionary to teach
          as what Allegra and I are going
          to teach you all tonight.
          With a theatrical flourish, Levi whirls around to face his
          two assistants, who have finished laying out their devices
          on the back table and are now standing crisply at attention
          at either end of it.

          Levi's face clouds slightly. The audience does not hear the
          following exchange.

          means that for our first wave
          test enclave we need twenty-one
          volunteers who will port in these
          slave units with the Game-Pod
          Goddess herself...
          Levi doesn't need to finish his pitch. Every hand is waving
          in the air, and every pair of lips is saying, "Me, me, oh
          God, please, let it be me!"
          Geller can only stand by modestly and beam at the intensity
          of the small crowd's enthusiasm.

          INT. COUNTRY CHURCH. MINUTES LATER - NIGHT

          A SHORT MONTAGE as the twenty-one volunteers mount the dais
          and are fitted with their game gear:
          The assistants undo the heavy-duty snap locks and split open
          the ski-boot-like plastic modules on the back table. Inside,
          resting in a lining of dense foam, are what look almost like
          living kidneys: the MetaFlesh Game-Pods.
          Coiled in each boot toe is the Y-shaped, multi-player
          UmbyCord that comes with each pod, a split twelve-foot
          connector cord that resembles an umbilical cord, twisted,
          translucent, blue and red veiny vessels running just below
          the surface.
          The volunteers watch in hushed reverence, as though about to
          receive communion.
          The game-pods are gingerly lifted out of their cases.
          The UmbyCords are uncoiled and plugged into ports in the
          back of the game-pods.
          The shirts, blouses, and jackets of the volunteers are
          lifted at the back to reveal their owners' bioports, which
          are small, soft-plastic, flesh-coloured permanent spinal
          jacks positioned just above the belt line.
          Twenty-two folding chairs are placed in a circle on the
          dais. As each volunteer has his UmbyCord plugged into his
          bioport, he takes one of the seats and places his quivering,
          rippling game-pod, now connected directly to his nervous
          system, on his lap.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          The last chair is taken by Allegra Geller, who is fussed
          i over and settled by Levi as she unpacks her own master game-
          pod with exaggerated delicacy and is then ported in to the
          players on either side of her.
          We END the short MONTAGE with the security guard, Pikul,
          standing with arms folded near the church's side door,
          watching the proceedings with fascination.
          A loud knocking at the door forces Pikul to turn away from
          the action on the dais. He walks over to the door and opens
          it. A hyper, exasperated fan almost tumbles into the church.
          Pikul immediately raises his electronic wand and bars his
          way.

                         PIKUL
          Hold it. Not so fast.
          In response, the fan thrusts a card at him.
          Pikul takes the card, a complex invitation card which
          includes a holographic photo of the fan under which floats
          his name, Joel Dichter. Dichter anxiously looks past Pikul
          into the depths of the church, nervously adjusting the vinyl
          case slung over his shoulder.

          Oh, god. I hope I'm not too late.

          Pikul uses his wand to scan the vinyl case, then opens the

          Yeah, well, you said it. Just

          Dichter has scanned OK. Pikul waves him into the church to
          join the spectators who will form the second wave and re-
          locks the door.
          On the dais, in the center of the circle of linked game
          players, Levi nods at Geller.

          player-in the circle as Levi steps down off the platform and
          retires to the far edge of the small, watching throng.

          I'll see you all back here in no
          time at all.
          Now the giddy laughter goes a touch nervous, uncertain, but
          it's too late. Geller depresses a nipple-like protuberance
          on the game-pod on her lap, and all the players close their
          eyes and go rigid, like members of a seance who have
          suddenly been contacted by the spirit world. The pods in
          their laps begin a rhythmic, peristaltic rippling.

          A strange, choral humming begins to fill the church. Pikul

          It's the new Antenna Research
          theme song. We thought this would
          be a good way to launch it.
          Everybody who plays eXistenZ is
          going to be very familiar with
          that tune.

          Catchy.
          Levi helps him out, and soon the whole room is humming along
          happily, warmed by the Antenna Research corporate theme
          song.
          The whole room, that is, except for Joel Dichter, who, at
          the edge of the dais, is more concerned with fumbling around
          in the vinyl pod-case hanging from his shoulder.
          In the case, we watch as Dichter tears open his obsolete
          game-pod to reveal a bizarre weapon, a pistol made of bone
          and gristle, almost like the half-decayed body of a small
          mammal - whose snout is the barrel, whose rigid hind leg is
          the trigger.
          Dichter takes his weapon out of its case, shakes off a few
          gelatinous strips of game-pod flesh, and steps up onto the
          dais.
          Pikul is the first to notice this. He glances at Levi, who's
          still blissed out and humming, then launches himself
          awkwardly through the crowd.
          Now in the middle of the circle, Dichter makes his way
          towards the blissfully unsuspecting Geller, raising his
          weapon as he goes.

          Dichter turns to see Pikul stumbling through the small
          crowd, scrambling onto the dais. Distracted, Dichter
          hurriedly raises his weapon again and fires it at Geller.
          The first shot hits her in the shoulder and spins her off
          her chair, which collapses over her and takes the second
          bullet on its seat rim.
          The circle of players on the dais moans as one, swoons and
          jostles: they are all feeling the neural surge of Geller's
          traumatized nervous system. Peeking out from under her
          folding chair, Geller's eyes are wide with fear and
          confusion. She clutches her shoulder without being aware of
          it. Blood seeps in between her fingers
          Now Levi and his two assistants scramble onto the platform
          to get at Dichter, who fires wildly, hitting two of the
          players nearest Geller. The circle of players immediately
          goes spastic, screaming and twitching and dropping to the
          ground and writhing. Many of them are clutching their
          shoulders in the same spot as Geller, sympathy pain
          transmitting through their UmbyCords.
          Pikul manages to tackle Dichter, then starts whacking at him
          with the security wand. Dichter twists around and raises his
          weapon at Pikul, who immediately backs off in terror. But
          before Dichter can pull the trigger, the two assistants
          produce small, normal pistols from hidden holsters and empty
          their clips into the prostrate Dichter. Dichter manages to
          squeeze off one last shot at the approaching Jevi, hitting
          him squarely in the chest. Levi goes down and is lost
          amongst the jostling feet.
          The watching fans pile onto the dais and begin to help the
          players unplug from the game-pods which are obviously
          causing them distress. Three of the players attack the dying
          Dichter, dragging their game-pods after them, kicking at
          whatever part of him they can find in the confused mass of
          bodies.
          in the turmoil, Pikul is knocked to the ground. Amid the
          stamping, sliding feet, he finds himself lying across the
          stricken-Levi. Levi clutches Pikul desperately.

          over the all-but-dead Dichter. He falls painfully to his
          knees, struggles up again, and finds the bizarre bone gun in
          his hand. Pikul stares at it, fascinated, horrified.
          He turns back to Levi, but Levi's eyes are rolling back as
          he loses consciousness. The two assistants are making their
          way towards them through the shoving, shuffling throng, guns
          cocked, faces set hard. Panicked, Pikul jams the bone gun
          into his suit pocket and jumps off the platform, wildly
          looking around for Geller.
          She and her chair have slipped off the dais in a heap only a
          few feet away, and she is in several kinds of agony. Pikul
          unports her, which immediately brings her some relief and a
          lot of clarity. Pikul wards off a couple of fans with one
          arm, screams at them.

          She finds the game-pod still under the folding chair, a bit
          flattened on one side but in one piece. She grabs the game-
          pod and its UmbyCord and stuffs them into her MetaFlesh pod
          case which has been knocked to the edge of the dais. As she
          clutches it to her, Pikul takes her hand and hauls her
          through the crowd, which is now spilling off the overcrowded
          dais and clutching at Geller fitfully, like Velcro. They
          head for the door, fighting everybody off as though they
          might be lethal.
          As they leave through the side door, Pikul sees five or six
          fans, shrieking like monkeys, still stomping and kicking the
          body of Dichter viciously, hysterically, while Levi's two
          assistants carry him to the safety of the church's apse.

          Pikul and Geller spew out of the doorway and find themselves
          standing alone in the weedy parking lot of the church. The
          church itself stands isolated on a country road just outside
          a town which is not much more than two gas stations and a
          crossroad.
          Pikul and Geller look around wildly. The vehicles in the
          parking lot are country, pickup trucks, rusted vans, 4x4s.
          Across the road, aloof, maybe too high-class for the parking
          lot, sits a Land Rover Defender 110, the one with the roof
          cage and the seven seats and the winch hanging off the

          off her shoulders leaving her almost naked, her shoulder
          wound livid in the 25-watt light of the night table lamp.
          Her hands twitch delicately over the surface of the pod like
          insect antennae, so delicately that we are not sure that she
          is actually touching the pod. Her eyes are half-closed, and
          she is obviously in some kind of trance-like, ecstatic

          In the heat of the summer night, game-pod case still slung

          Gas pulls the trigger on the stud-finder, then removes it
          from Pikul's back. We see a small purple flower-mark, like
          the kind that marks sides of beef, on the skin over Pikul's
          spine just above the belt line. Pikul stands up from his
          kneeling position on the wingback chair. He stretches,

          We are close on a bizarre insect which sits unsteadily on
          the chrome of a gas pump handle. Geller's hand comes into
          frame and gently eases the creature into its palm. Geller
          floats her hand closer to her face and studies the creature
          with an expression of rapture on her face.
          The insect is large, praying mantis-sized, and it has two
          heads, neither of which seems to know how to deal with the
          other one. Each time it attempts to move, it falls over in
          an awkward heap because its legs are all different sizes and
          shapes. It beats its large, papery wings wildly in order to
          pull itself upright and then begins the whole clumsy process
          all over again. Eventually, its wing action lifts it off
          Geller's hand - more by accident than will, it seems - and
          the creature disappears in the darkness surrounding the gas
          pumps.

          INT. GAS-STATION GARAGE. MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

          Wearing mechanic's work gloves, Gas fires in the bioport
          plug. Its impact knocks the breath out of Pikul, like being
          kicked in the spine; he can't even scream. When Gas pulls
          the insertion device away from Pikul's back, we see the
          glossy plastic head of the bioport plug. It's surrounded by
          a small, angry-looking volcano of rashy, irritated flesh.

                         GELLER
          That swelling doesn't last for
          long. Tomorrow, you won't even
          notice it.

                         PIKUL
          I love it. Great.
          Pikul tries to get up from the wingback chair and promptly
          collapses into the arms of Geller and Gas.

          The procedure comes with its own
          epidural, just like when you have
          a baby. Kinda like instant
          paralysis from the waist down?
          That's why it didn't hurt you.
          It'll wear off in about twenty
          minutes.
          As they ease Pikul into a sitting position in the chair, Gas
          almost drops the insertion gun which he has been holding in
          one hand. He leans it against the wingback chair, and Pikul
          notices blood and flecks of skin on Gas's work gloves.

          these days, don't they? I'm gonna
          go wash up. You two make
          yourselves at home.
          Gas strides off towards the washroom with an air of great
          satisfaction. Geller eases her game-pod out of its case and
          starts to attach its two-player, Y-shaped UmbyCord to it.

          She lifts up his shirt to reveal the new bioport. It already
          looks a bit less angry than it did before. Geller caresses
          it, prods it, plays with it. Then she takes out a little
          bottle of WD-40 and sprays it around and into the port.

          Geller gently works her UmbyJack into Pikul's bioport. She
          locks her eyes onto his, then squeezes her game-pod's ON
          teat. Instantly, her pod convulses and begins to flash and
          spark and crackle. White electronic smoke seeps from its
          crevices and a kind of bioelectronic fat sputters from its
          pores.
          Geller leaps up from the arm of the chair and rips her
          UmbyJack out of Pikul's spine. He can't feel it, but the
          furious force of her move twists him in his chair.

          INT. WORKSHOP CHALET - DAY

          In the strange atmosphere of the workshop chalet, Vinokur is
          taking Geller's pod apart. It is more like surgery on an
          alien life form than computer electronics. The room feels
          like a weird combination of a hi-tech operating room and a
          woodworking class.
          A cherubic middle-aged man - Landry - who looks more like a
          farmhand than an electronics technician, assists Vinokur as
          he works.

          INT. GUEST CHALET - NIGHT

          In their chalet, a cozy and inn-like'space, Pikul and Geller
          examine his new bioport while sitting on one of the chalet's
          twin beds. The region around the port looks swollen, bruised
          and tender.

          It's not infected. It's just
          excited. It wants action.
          She attempts to jack her pod into his port using the Y-
          shaped UmbyCord, but he twists away from her.

                         PIKUL
          But I really don't think that I
          want action. Me, I mean. The
          bearer of the excited bioport.
          What I want is... not now. Not
          here. I feel too... too exposed.
          Geller sighs, then switches into her explaining-the-facts-
          of-life-to-a-child mode. They are both aware that they are
          replaying an earlier moment.

          way I can tell if everything's OK

          melt away around them.

          INT. GAME STORE - NIGHT

          The chalet melts away and is replaced by a scruffy game
          store. A lot of kids and strange adults mill around amongst
          the dusty racks and pinball machines, examining packages of
          weird games and game devices, muttering secretively to each
          other, and it is amongst these dull rows of shelves that
          Pikul and Geller find themselves standing.
          A cashier works away behind an old-fashioned cash register
          that sits on a tall counter. The cashier, a gangly, sallow
          young man, glances at Pikul and Geller suspiciously from
          time to time.
          Pikul feels himself', his clothes, moves his arms, his
          tongue. He feels around behind him but there is no game-pod
          or UmbyCord in sight.

                         GELLER
          Look at him.
          Pikul does. Nader doesn't seem to have heard him. In fact,
          he doesn't respond at all other than to hum the Antenna
          Research corporate-song and tap his fingers repetitively,
          caught in a small behavioural loop. Geller chuckles at
          Pikul's confusion.

          He's gone into a game loop, he's
          locked up, and he won't come out
          of it until you give him a proper

          Nader immediately comes out of his loop. He chuckles.

          You're right. That is all tha

          Well, Nader, you said you had
          what we want. We're waiting.

          You're going to need these micro-
          pods to download your new
          identities. I assume that you
          both have had those industry
          standard bioports you mentioned
          installed.

          not.

          We'd better check.
          While Nader goes into game lock-up, Geller lifts up her
          shirt. Pikul takes a look. Her bioport is there, although
          slightly rougher, puckered, more organic than in non-game
          life.

                         PIKUL
          Yeah, it's there. Looks a little

          Pikul and Geller examine the pak, which bears the Cortical
          Systematics name and logo. It seems to be a miniature
          version of their real-life game-pod.

          OK. The pods are so small they
          plug directly into the bioport.
          Geller delicately twists the end of the micro-pod into

          ripples, and then slowly flows and wriggles its way into
          Pikul's bioport until it has completely disappeared.

          They change positions. Pikul ports in the micro-pod and it
          duly crawls its way into Geller's bioport. Tenderly, as
          though kissing a cut to make it better, Pikul kisses her

          anger.

          INT. TROUT FARM. ASSEMBLY LINE - DAY

          Pikul finds himself sitting at an immensely long bench in
          the process of assembling insect motherboards along with
          many other workers. Pikul can still feel the warmth of
          Geller's body, but she's nowhere to be seen. A gritty,
          narrow conveyor belt runs down the middle of the bench, upon
          which floats an endless stream of motherboard parts which
          the workers pick off as they need them. The belt begins and
          ends in the anonymous smoky innards of the building.
          The place, a high-ceilinged pre-fab, long and narrow with
          hundreds of blanked-out windows, houses a game-pod assembly
          line. Pikul looks down to find himself wearing a photo-ID
          card clipped to his shirt pocket that tells him he is
          somebody named LARRY ASHEN. He has to twist the card around
          because, of course, from his vantage point it is upside
          down.

                         NOURISH
          Tryin' to remember who you are?
          Pikul snaps his head up to see a long-haired, morose-looking
          worker sitting next to him, snickering. Mocking Pikul, he
          twists his own card around, comically bunching up his work
          shirt so he can read his own name, which is YEVGENY NOURISH.

                         NOURISH
          Hey, it works! I must be Yevgeny
          Nourish!
          Nourish leans over to squint at Pikul's name tag.

                         NOURISH
          And you... you are new to the

          Pikul looks around him. The place is humming, but Geller is
          still nowhere in sight. The workers are small-town locals o_Â°
          a wide range of ages.
          Pikul looks down at his own hands, which seem to,know what
          to do: place glue on the boards, glue them down to a resin
          frame using a template, insert needle-like electrodes into
          the bodies of certain epoxied insects. The insect boards,
          Pikul notes, are actually whole insects coated in epoxy and
          frozen together like a sick collage. At least, here in the
          game they are.
          Pikul is now automatically doing flashy moves with the odd
          materials in front of him with great dexterity. Nourish
          takes note of this.

          It surprises me more than it
          surprises you.
          Nourish moves back to the insect motherboard that he has
          been working on, then leans over again exactly as he did the
          first time. It has the effect of an instant replay, but not
          in slow-motion.

          Pikul realizes he hasn't given the right answer. He now just
          lets it come without thinking.

          All right, I'll do that.
          Nourish turns back to his task and begins to work away as
          though Pikul didn't exist.
          Pikul takes this cue to go back to his own board and is soon
          preoccupied with testing the board's circuits by porting it
          into a test UmbyCord that uncoils from the center of the
          bench. His strange reverie, watching himself work on auto-
          pilot at this bizarre task, is soon interrupted by a worker
          pushing a canvas and metal cart with bicycle wheels. The
          worker parks the cart behind Pikul and taps him on the
          shoulder.

          INT. TROUT FARM. POD ASSEMBLY BAYS - DAY

          Pikul enters the huge back wing of the Trout Farm and walks
          along a rampway, pushing his cart past the pod assembly-bay
          area. There, pods very much like the one he and Geller are
          ported into back home are being assembled - motherboards
          inserted, internal ports connected, fleshy housings like the
          corpses of small amphibians sewn up - by small teams of
          workers.
          The bays themselves are old horse stalls with straw still
          covering the dirt floors. But because the pods are primarily
          organic, the teams are more like groups of masked surgical
          workers in a series of impossibly small and filthy operating
          rooms than, let's say, auto-assembly teams in a progressive
          Saab plant.
          As Pikul wheels his cart past each stall, he digs into the
          cart's canvas bag and delivers insect boards wrapped in
          brown wax paper to the eagerly awaiting pod teams.
          In the last bay, one of the masked surgeons grabs him by the
          hand instead of taking the proferred motherboard pnd leads
          himm to an isolated corner. Her ID card says she is BARB
          BRECKEN, and her photo says she is Geller.

          assembly line say to you?
          Pikul's expression shows that there is a return game line
          welling up in his mouth, tickling his tongue, perhaps.
          Perversely, he fights it, but it comes out anyway.

          He told me where to have lunch.

          EXT. CHINESE RESTAURANT IN THE WOODS - DAY

          A ragged stream of pod-assembly workers trickles along a
          densely wooded gravel path towards a very un-Chinese
          Victorian red-brick farmhouse. A small river flows not more
          than fifty feet from the restaurant, mimicking the movement
          of the line of workers.
          The workers all file past a sign on the lawn in front of the
          building which reads, MONA ZHANG'S BEIJING CUISINE.

          INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT IN THE WOODS - DAY

          Pikul and Geller are seated at a round Formica-covered table
          with a lazy Susan serving wheel in the centre of it, all
          very Mandarin in style. Other workers sit sullenly at their
          table, wordless, suspicious.
          A restaurant dog, a mongrel with a lot a heavy, collie-like
          fur, lies basking in a pane of sunlight. in a corner.
          The waiter, a young, athletic Chinese man, comes over
          bringing rice and tea.

                         WAITER
          We have nice sea bass today.

          Pikul and Geller exchange a look. Pikul shrugs OK.

                         PIKUL
          We want the special.
          The waiter looks stunned. The others at their table look
          distressed. The waiter seems to lock up, almost freeze-
          framed.

          The special is for special

          But this is a special occasion.
          It's...
          Pikul pauses, waiting for the proper game line to
          materialize in his mouth. Finally, it does. He gestures
          towards Geller.

                         PIKUL
          It's her birthday.
          The waiter locks up for a moment, then unfreezes.

                         WAITER
          A birthday is a special occasion.
          I will therefore bring the
          special for everybody.
          The waiter walks away. The others at the table get up and
          move away, drift over to other tables with occasional
          furtive backward glances at Pikul and Geller.

          served out most of the creatures to himself and is avidly
          stripping the meat off their bones.

          doing me any good.
          Pikul is now snapping together bits and pieces of bone,
          gristle and flesh, a grotesque Lego set. When he's finished,
          he's made a gun very much like the one that was used in the
          attempted assassination in the church.

          It should be OK.
          Now Pikul reaches into his mouth, pulls out a bridge of
          three teeth - one of them gold-filled - and loads them into
          the gristly magazine.

                         GELLER
          It probably wasn't until you
          ordered the special.
          He slaps the magazine into the handle, then pulls the slide
          back and releases it so that there is now a toothy round in

          I found this in my soup and I'm
          very upset.
          Pikul fires. The tooth-bullet hits the waiter in the
          cheekbone. A chunk of the waiter's cheekbone comes off and
          his head jerks back like a fighter taking a stiff jab.
          The waiter's sweet face instantly transforms into a hideous,
          angry, snarling mask of hatred. He pulls a meat cleaver out
          of his jacket.
          Geller immediately throws her bowl of hot-and-sour soup into
          the waiter's face. The waiter screams, then wildly wipes the
          noodles and goop out of his eyes. He raises the cleaver over
          his head.
          The waiter swings and lunges across the table, managing only
          to hack the tip of the gun off. Pikul is shocked to see the
          gun begin to bleed. The waiter, sprawling across the table,
          screams as he tries to reach Geller with his cleaver. Pikul

          44.
          fires into the waiter's shrieking, open mouth - a tooth-
          bullet into teeth.
          A piece of the waiter's skull comes off like a piece of
          coconut, the gold-filled tooth now flattened and embedded in
          it. The gun is bleeding all over Pikul's hand now. He drops
          it in disgust.
          The restaurant dog comes out of nowhere, picks the gun up,
          and runs off with it under a table, where he crouches down
          and starts to gnaw on it, growling.
          Pikul stands up shakily, begins to become aware of the
          strange, tense stillness of the other patrons in the
          restaurant.

          To his surprise, the patrons actually turn back to their
          meals, albeit with a certain sinister reluctance.
          Pikul looks around wildly.

          INT. KITCHEN. CHINESE RESTAURANT - DAY

          Geller and Pikul enter the kitchen and take a look around.
          There are mutant amphibians and reptiles hung up everywhere,
          in bowls and on chopping blocks. The kitchen workers have
          all turned to look at the intruders.
          Suddenly, a cook steps forward from around the door. We can
          now see that it is Nourish in a chef's outfit.

                         NOURISH

          Yes. It was very... revealing.

          It certainly was for me. You both
          passed our little test with
          flying colours.

          Why did the Chinese waiter have
          to die?

                         NOURISH
          A waiter hears many things spoken
          when people are relaxed and
          eating. A waiter has many
          opportunities for betrayal.

                         PIKUL

          They go out a side door, and find themselves walking along
          the river that links the Chinese restaurant and the Trout
          Farm.

          EXT. THE RIVER - DAY

          The trio walk along the bank of the river that feeds the
          Trout Farm. Nourish points out a connected series of rock-
          lined, internally-lighted pools, some stagnant, like ponds,
          and some clear, with river water running through them.

                         NOURISH
          See there, the breeding pools.
          The pools are all alive with strange creatures, mutated
          fish, amphibians, and, along the small, muddy terraces that
          border the pools, reptiles. Like the dysfunctional insect at
          the gas station, these creatures do not work very well. They
          float and swim belly up, lie on their sides at the bottom of
          their pools, flop and flounder around, and in general,
          ostentatiously fail to function.

          As Pikul and Geller pretend to examine the merchandise, they
          scan the game store for Nader. The store is quite crowded -
          same style of customers, maybe even some of the same faces,
          different clothes. They don't see Nader.
          Geller goes up to the cashier, the same gangly, sallow,
          bespectacled young man who was there the first time.

          Pikul and Geller feel that they are being scutinized
          carefully by shoppers who turn their eyes away from them at
          the last moment, so that they can't be absolutely certain.
          And as for us - have we glimpsed some characters from the
          game that we have already seen? Possibly even Wittold Levi

          Pikul and Geller sit on the bed, game-pod between them,
          UmbyCord joining them to each other and to the pod. They
          look at each other. Pikul shrugs.

          uncertainly, holding a large tray.

          right, I take it?
          An awkward moment, as though Vinokur has caught the pair
          having illicit sex. Vinokur moves into the room towards the
          table.

          All four walls of the assembly bay are on fire now. The

          The cashier strides into the room and pulls her to her feet.
          She tries to pick up her pod, but the cashier tugs her away
          from it.

          The cashier unslings his submachine gun, cocks it, and blows
          the pod into streaks of slime, flesh, and slivers of insect-
          board. Geller is in shock. Pikul turns her to face him,
          speaks' forcefully right into her face, shuts everything else
          out.

          Allegra, listen to me. I think
          we're still inside the game. I
          think your real pod's out there
          somewhere, somewhere safe. I
          think it's OK to let go of this
          one, this pod. It's not the real
          one.
          A Molotov cocktail comes sailing into the room and shatters
          against the bed. The bed ignites with an explosive whump.

          The cashier leads Pikul and Geller out of the guest chalet
          and down the mountain path. The chalet next to theirs begins
          to implode as they scurry by it.
          As they flee, they realize that all the chalets are on fire.
          There are people trying to fight the fires, running
          r frantically everywhere with hand-held extinguishers. There
          is also scattered gunfire, but who's firing on whom is
          impossible to tell.

          to the ground.
          From the shadows of the trees, backlit by the fiery

          INT. COUNTRY CHURCH - NIGHT

          We melt back up into the church, which we last saw in the
          first scene. But there are many differences between then and
          now,
          Geller is sitting in her chair on the dais as before, her
          eyes just beginning to flutter open. But Pikul is sitting
          next to her, also playing the game. And next to him is
          Nourish, whom we are even more surprised to see in this
          context.
          Aad in fact, the players who are sitting in the circle of
          chairs on the dais are all characters who have been in the
          movie up to this point: Nader, the cashier, Dichter, Gas,
          Vinkokur, even Frances, the limo driver.
          The players are all emerging from a game that has just ended
          - the movie we have been watching - and they begin to stir
          in their game gear, which is nothing like the organic pod-
          technology we have just seen.
          On the contrary, the garners are wearing head-gear with
          electrodes, more like normal clunky Virtual-Reality
          equipment, and are linked by mundane wires. In their laps
          they hold, not game-pods, but sleek plastic game modules,
          each about the size of a walkman, with holes into Which
          I their left thumbs are inserted - a simpler and cruder
          version of the bioports we have become used to.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Watching the proceedings from down on the church floor are
          two security guards, neither of whom is Pikul, of course. On
          a leash, one of the security guards holds the dog that, in
          the game, picked up the gristle gun in the Chinese
          restaurant.
          Also monitoring the action are a woman, Merle, who is the
          game's actual project manager - the real-life version of the
          game-character Levi - and her two assistants.
          There is a collective sigh as the game finally releases the

          part of that process tonight.
          When we've collected all the
          head-sets and game modules, we'll
          be handing out a questionnaire to
          each of you, and I'd like your
          answers to the questions to be as
          honest, as brutal, as clear as
          you can make them. Don't hold
          back. After that, we're going to
          form a focus group where we'll
          discuss details of each of your
          experiences playing TranscendenZ.
          You've all had different but
          interlocking lives in the game,

          you hear each other's stories.

          It had a very strong, very real

          It sure didn't come from me. The
          tone of it in the game was very,
          very passionate, fanatical. And
          the atmosphere of paranoia and
          betrayal was overwhelming. The
          whole thing felt unstable,
          dangerous, volatile. But worse
          than that, there was a kind of
          industrial espionage subplot.

          ship from one game company to

          tracks, raise their hands, and start to back away as the
          place suddenly explodes in screams and pandemonium.
          As Pikul and Geller in their turn back towards the front
          exit, they glide past the young Chinese man who was the

          Now Pikul and Geller are just about to turn and follow the
          dog when the waiter unfreezes and takes a step away from the
          pillar towards them. They immediately swing their pistols
          over towards him. The waiter stops and raises his hands.

          No, wait, you don't have to shoot
          me. I just wanted to ask you a
          question. _

          Hey, tell me the truth. Are we
          still in the game?
          Pikul and Geller look at each other, then into the camera.
          The church melts down around them into blackness.
