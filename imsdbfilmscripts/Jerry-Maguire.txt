              EARTH FROM SPACE
 
              The blue marble as seen from space.  We hear the calm voice
              of Jerry Maguire, talking just to us.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                        Airight so this is the world and
                        there are five billion people on
                        it.  When I was a kid there were
                        three.  It's hard to keep up.
 
              AMERICA FROM SPACE
 
              The great continent through mist and swirling skies.
              (Satellites and other pieces of skycasting equipment float
              by.)
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                        That's better.  That's america.
                        See, America still sets the tone
                        for the world...
 
              KID ON BASKETBALL COURT
 
              A puberty-ravaged kid dribbles a basketball, stares straight
              at us.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                        In Indiana -- Clark Hodd.  13.
                        The best point guard in the
                        country. Puberty hasn't been easy.
 
              Discreetly, his hand slips into his pants and scratches.
 
              Girl on a high dive she's poised.  A faraway look in her eyes.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                               (continuing)
                        Becky Farling.  You'll see her in
                        the next Olympics.
 
              She launches her dive into mid-air, into nothingness.
 
              ON TEENAGE GIRL BOXER
 
              throwing punches toward the camera.


                                                                     2.
 
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                        Seattle, Washington.  Dallas
                        Malloy. Went to court to be
                        allowed to box professionally.
                        She's 16.
 
              ON A YOUNG BASEBALL PLAYER
 
              at bat.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                        Art Stallings, Indio, California.
                        Check out what pure joy looks like.
 
              He swats a pitch -- not out of the park, it's much sweeter
              than that.  He drills it over the first baseman's head, just
              out of reach of his glove. Art runs to first, laughing.  Pats
              the first baseman's butt.  Gotcha.
 
              ON GOLDEN BOY QUARTERBACK -- FRANK CUSHMAN
 
              A line of NFL scouts watch a dazzling pass from a future star.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                        In Odessa, Texas, the great Frank
                        Cushman.  Cush is 20.
                        Quarterback, role model, my
                        client. He'll probably go number
                        one in the draft this year.
 
              Cush turns into a closer shot.  He's a living magazine cover.
 
              A YOUNG CHAMPIONSHIP GOLFER
 
              eyeing a long but level putt.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                        There's genius everywhere, but
                        until they turn pro, it's like
                        popcorn in the pan. Some pop...
 
              The kid misses the shot, whips his club at his coach.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                               (continuing)
                        ...  some don't.
 
              Hold on the kid, he's all youthful adrenalin, breathing hard.
              Portrait of an intense young competitor.
 
                                                       SMASH CUT TO:


                                                                     3.
 
 
              INT. NFL OWNERS MEETING/PALM DESERT FOUR SEASONS -- DAY
 
              A wall of new NFL merchandise.  Television monitors blink
              with the latest endorsement films. Into frame moves JERRY
              MAGUIRE, 35.  He walks briskly and smoothly, yellow legal
              tablet in hand, at home in this lobby filled with Athletes
              and Sports Team Owners.  We hear Herb Alpert's epic
              instrumental, "The Lonely Bull."
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                        Now I'm the guy you don't usually
                        see. I'm the one behind the
                        scenes.  I'm the sports agent.
 
              INT. NFL OWNER'S MEETING LOBBY -- MINUTES LATER
 
              Jerry sits in a red leather chair, across from an agitated
              General Manager.  He cooly works out figures on a yellow
              legal tablet.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Easy now, we can spread these
                        numbers over five years...
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                        You know those photos where the
                        new player holds up the team
                        jersey and poses with the owner?

                               (continuing)
                        That's me on the left.
 
              ON ANONYMOUS NEWPORT BEACH BUILDING
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                        Inside that building, that's where
                        I work.  Sports Management
                        International.
 
              INT. SMI CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY
 
              The SMI agents are a fierce, happy bunch.  They sit in a
              carefully appointed conference room.
 
              Sports photos and posters are framed on the walls.  The signs
              of global marketing are omnipresent.  Each agent has a silver
              tray containing soft drinks and a glass pitcher of water.
              Through the glass window, we see a large office divided up
              into many cubicles.


                                                                     4.
 
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                        Thirty-three out of shape agents
                        guiding the careers of 2,120 of
                        the most finely-tuned athletes
                        alive...
 
              Near the end of the table sits Jerry Maguire.  The word
              "millions" appears often and easily in his conversation.
              Shot moves in.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                               (continuing)
                        ... in this economy, sometimes
                        emotions run a little high.
 
              INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE -- HOUSTON -- DAY
 
              An unmarked car pulls into the underground parking facility
              of the Houston Police Department.  A cluster of chattering
              media members move in on the car. ("Baja!!"  "Baja, over
              here!!")  Back doors open, and out steps Jerry Maguire with
              huge offensive lineman, BOBBY "BAJA" BRUNARD, 22.  He is
              angry, and he is handcuffed.
 
                                  WOMAN REPORTER
                        Was the girl 16 or seventeen?
 
                                  MAN REPORTER
                        Were you aiming at anyone when you
                        fired the shot in the 7/l1?
 
              Jerry whips in between Baja and the taunting media, blocking
              him off and forcing him through the glass doors into the
              police department.  Professional smile in place, Maguire
              attempts spin.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Listen, there's no proof of
                        anything except that this guy is
                        a sensational athlete.
 
              In the background, we hear baja bellowing insults at the
              press.
 
              INT. ATLANTA RED CARPET ROOM -- ANOTHER DAY
 
              Jerry now sits next to a towering white 27 year-old
              basketball player with a bad haircut. He is CALVIN NACK.
              They are signing a contract in the airport lounge. A little
              BOY approaches the player with a basketball trading card.
 
                                  LITTLE BOY
                        Are you Calvin Nack?  Could you
                        sign my card?


                                                                     5.
 
 
              Nack bends down with a kindly-looking face.
 
                                  CALVIN NACK
                        I'm sorry little fella.  I can't
                        sign that particular brand of
                        card.  I can only sign Pro-Jam
                        Blue Dot cards.
 
              The Little Boy looks confused. As Calvin Nack turns to grab
              an orange juice from a barmaid, Jerry smoothly dishes off a
              business card to the little boy.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                        Lately, it's gotten worse.
 
              INT. HOSPITAL BEDROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Hockey Player STEVE REMO, 33, is a big man in a small bed.
              He is in traction, with concussion.  DOCTOR stands nearby,
              shoots Jerry a look of concern.  Family is nearby.
 
                                  DOCTOR
                        Do you know your name?
 
                                  STEVE REMO
                        I uh... wait.  Wait, here it
                        comes. I have it.  My name is
                        Steve Remo. I play for the
                        Blackhawks.
                               (now on a roll)
                        You are my son.  This pretty lady
                        is my wife.  And you are...
 
              Jerry nods encouragingly, presents his best "familiar" face.
 
                                  STEVE REMO
                               (continuing)
                        My agent!
 
                                  JERRY
                        Yes!
 
                                  STEVE REMO
                        And I gotta play this weekend,
                        Doc. If I play in 65% of the
                        games, I make my bonus.
 
              EXT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY -- NIGHT
 
              Remo's 14 year-old SON (JESSE) confronts Jerry outside the
              hospital room. He's a hulking kid, a Pop Warner football
              player himself. His voice is in the process of changing.


                                                                     6.
 
 
                                  SON
                        This is his fourth concussion.
                        Shouldn't somebody get him to stop?
 
              As he talks, Jerry's cellular phone rings in his bag.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (glib, easy)
                        Come on -- it'd take a tank to
                        stop your dad.  It would take all
                        five Super Trooper VR Warriors,
                        right?
 
              The kid stares at Maguire.  It feels as if the kid is peering
              into his soul... and all he sees is trash.
 
                                  SON
                        Fuck you.
 
              The kid turns and exits in disgust.  He leaves Jerry standing
              in the hallway.  Devastated. Music.
 
              EXT. RENTAL CAR SHUTTLE -- DAY
 
              Jerry Maguire upset in a rental shuttle.  Passing through
              frame. Music.  Phone still ringing.
 
              INT. MIAMI HOTEL ROOM -- DAY
 
              Jerry sleeps.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                        Two nights later in Miami at our
                        corporate conference, a
                        breakthrough. Breakdown?
                        Breakthrough.
 
              Jerry's eyes open.  Breathing strangely.  Trembling, he holds
              onto the nightstand for grounding.
 
              He gets up, takes a few gulps of air, walks to mini-bar.
              Gathers some tiny ice cubes in his hand, smears them across
              his face.  This feeling is new to him.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                               (continuing)
                        It was the oddest, most unexpected
                        thing.  I began writing what they
                        call a Mission Statement for my
                        company. You know -- a Mission
                        Statement -- a suggestion for the
                        future.


                                                                     7.
 
 
              INT. MIAMI HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry types, a pot of coffee and tray of room service nearby.
              we watch his face, alive now.
 
              There is a direct line from the deepest part of him to the
              words he's typing.  His fingers fly.  Even his eyes grow
              moist.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                        What started out as one page
                        became twenty-five. Suddenly I was
                        my father's son.  I was
                        remembering the simple pleasures
                        of this job, how I ended up here
                        out of law school, the way a
                        stadium sounds when one of my
                        players performs well on the
                        field... I was remembering even
                        the words of the late Dicky Fox,
                        the original sports agent, who
                        said:
 
              SHOT OF DICKY FOX
 
                                  DICKY FOX
                        The key to this job is personal
                        relationships.
 
              As Jerry continues typing, his voice is excited now.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                        And suddenly it was all pretty
                        clear. The answer was fewer
                        clients.  Caring for them, caring
                        for ourselves, and the games too.
                        Starting our lives, really.
 
              SHOT OF SENTENCE:  We must embrace what is still virginal
              about our own enthusiasm, we must crack open the tightly
              clenched fist and give back a little for the common good, we
              must simply be the best versions of ourselves... that
              goodness will be unbeatable and the money will appear.
 
              He pauses, and wipes his eyes, still considering the sentence.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                               (continuing)
                        Hey, I'll be the first to admit
                        it. What I was writing was
                        somewhat "touchy feely."
 
              He deletes it.  And then -- zip -- he restores it and
              continues on, boldly.


                                                                     8.

                               (continuing)
                        I didn't care.  I had lost the
                        ability to bullshit.  It was the
                        me I'd always wanted to be.
 
              INT. KINKO'S COPIES -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry in T-shirt stands proudly watching copies pumped out.
              Wired college students, band guys, other Copy People of the
              Night nearby.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                        I printed it up in the middle of
                        the night, before I could re-think
                        it.
 
              Industrial, multi-pierced Kinko's copy guy examines the first
              printed copy of the Mission Statement.  He nods approvingly,
              taps his heart in tribute.  He slides a copy across the
              counter, for Jerry's approval.

                                  KINKO'S GUY
                        That's how you become great, man.
                        You hang your ba11s out there.
 
              Jerry nods.  It's 3 AM, and this guy sounds and looks like a
              prophet.  In fact, everyone in Kinko's at 3 AM does.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (self-effacing)
                        Thanks.
 
              ON MEMOS
 
              being stuffed into mail-slots.
 
              INT. HOTEL ROOM -- MORNING
 
              Jerry splashes water onto his face.  The sun is coming up.
              He looks younger, lighter.
 
              ON TV MOVIE  (JERRY WATCHING)
 
              Suddenly, dramatic movie score.  It's Dana Andrews, showing
              Gene Tierney the newspaper reports of her death in Laura.
              ("Someone was murdered in this room last night... any idea
              who it was?")  Camera whips to Jerry, standing watching as he
              packs.  A slight concern on his face.  He moves to the phone,
              and dials with urgency.


                                                                     9.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Hi, it's jerry maguire.  Uh,
                        listen did those manuscripts
                        get... Oh they did... No no no no
                        no, that's fine...
 
              INT. ELEVATOR -- DAY
 
                                  JERRY
                        Jerry in suit, alone with his
                        luggage.  Dry throat. clammy,
                        holds onto the handrail to steady
                        himself.
 
              INT. LOBBY -- DAY
 
              The lobby is filled with SMI agents.  The blue Mission
              Statement is in evidence everywhere.  Jerry inconspicuously
              turns the corner, yearns to blend in.  It's impossible, the
              recognition ripples through the lobby.  Underling agent BOB
              SUGAR, 25, is the first to grab Maguire by the shoulders.
              ("Finally, someone said it!") Suddenly another agent begins
              to clap, then reluctantly, another. Soon, the ovation rocks
              the lobby.  (In a three-shot near the front desk, we see a 26
              year-old female employee of SMI applauding with Mission
              Statement in hand, her sleepy son at her side.)  Jerry
              motions for them all to stop, but clearly he could listen
              forever. It is a watershed moment in his life.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                        I was 35.  I had started my life.
 
              Swing off Maguire to find two agents standing clapping
              enthusiastically near the elevator. One offers gum to the
              other.
 
                                  AGENT # 1 (RACHEL)
                        How long you give him?
 
                                  AGENT # 2 (CHRIS)
                        Mmmm.  A week.
 
              ON AIRPLANE WHEELS
 
              folding up into a plane, as music and credits end.
 
              INT. AIRPLANE/FIRST CLASS -- NIGHT
 
              We move past a snoring businessman, onto tired but
              adrenalized Jerry Maguire.  He sits in first-class, working
              on his laptop, a pile of newspapers and magazines nearby.
              The WOMAN PASSENGER next to him, 3oish, finishes up a spicy
              phone conversation with her boyfriend.


                                                                     10.
 
 
                                  WOMAN
                        Monkeyface... monkeyface,
                        listen... I'm not going to say it
                        here.... no...
 
              Jerry continues to work, as his laptop now beeps.  Battery's
              low.
 
                                  WOMAN
                               (continuing)
                        ...  oh listen, I got you the
                        perfect white shirt, at this out
                        of the way place... no... quit
                        trying to make me say it!
 
              Jerry shuts off his laptop and prepares for sleep.  Trying
              not to listen.
 
                                  WOMAN
                               (continuing)
                        how about if I do it and don't say
                        it... mmmm... see you soon...
 
              She laughs seductively and hangs up.  She is still buzzed
              from the conversation.  Jerry turns to her, surprising her.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I have to ask.
 
                                  WOMAN
                               (protective)
                        What --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Where'd you find the perfect white
                        shirt?
 
              She laughs, it's an infectious laugh -- two strangers
              enjoying the good life -- as we DRIFT BACK three rows, past
              the panel separating the cool comfort of first class from the
              stuffy airless and uncomfortable world of coach.
 
              We meet DOROTHY BOYD, 26.  A harried passenger on this bus in
              the sky.  Her clothes are part-contemporary, part mother-
              functional. She is never as composed or in control as she
              wants to be. Right now she is devoted to the sneezing kid in
              the wrinkled white-shirt sitting next to her.  It is RAY, her
              five-year old son.  Dorothy is covered in toys and books.
              Stuffed into the side pocket is Jerry's Mission Statement.
              The easy laughter from three rows ahead washes over her like
              cold water, as she rings again for a Flight Attendant.  The
              overworked ATTENDANT arrives, pissed, snapping off the bell.


                                                                     11.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Look, my son is allergic to the
                        material in these blankets -
 
                                  ATTENDANT
                        That's all we have.
 
              The Attendant offers a bundle of soggy cocktail napkins and
              is about to exit as Ray makes a gagging noise.  He's about to
              get sick. Both women reach for an airsick bag, and get it to
              his mouth just in time. Their faces are now inches apart.
 
                                  ATTENDANT
                               (continuing)
                        I'm sorry I was rude just then --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        It's okay.  We're in it together
                        now...
 
              The Attendant now exits helpfully with the bag.
 
                                  WOMAN'S VOICE
                        Don't take anything I say
                        seriously! I love to flirt!
 
              Dorothy, irritated, leans out into the aisle to look for the
              heads that belong to these voices.
 
              BACK TO JERRY AND WOMAN
 
                                  WOMAN
                        You're with the sports people on
                        the plane, right?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Jerry Maguire.  SMI.
 
                                  WOMAN
                        Bobbi Fallon.  BPI.  I'm producing
                        the Coke commercials for the
                        playoffs.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well.  Good luck with that --
 
              He nods, as he reaches up to shut off the light.  Politely
              stifles another yawn.  He shuts his eyes, settles into sleep.
              Bobbi leans into his darkness.
 
                                  WOMAN
                        Can I just get a quick "man's"
                        opinion from you on something?
 
                                                       DISSOLVE TO:


                                                                     12.
 
 
              INT.  FIRST CLASS SEATS -- LATER
 
              Bobbi is intense now, unburdening, as tired Jerry listens
              like a priest.
 
                                  WOMAN
                        And I can't say his name without
                        laughing I want to eat him up. I
                        want to say goodbye to every bad
                        thought I ever had about
                        relationships.  I mean, I crave
                        this guy... and yet... why... why
                        did I have that affair this
                        weekend?  Does that mean I'm not
                        in love with my boyfriend?
 
                                  JERRY
                        I think you'll know when you see
                        him at the gate.
 
                                  WOMAN
                        It's the death rattle of my
                        singlehood, right? Because I
                        finally see the white picket fence
                        looming and I love it/hate it/love
                        it/hate it/ love it... you're
                        right, I'll know when I see him.
                        Why is it so easy to talk with
                        you?!  Tell me about your fiancee.
 
              Maguire fights another yawn.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I uh... don't think we're quite at
                        your pitch yet.
 
                                  WOMAN
                        Tell me, and then you can sleep.
 
                                  JERRY
                        She's an NFL publicist... amazing
                        sense of style... former
                        athlete... volleyball... world
                        class... really knows how to live
                        every moment of her life, which is
                        why I should take a nap now...
 
              BACK TO DOROTHY
 
              Her sleeping son now silent, she can't help but listen.

                               (impatient)
                        Oh, tell the story.

                        --so our first date, she told me
                        about her favorite place in the
                        world, the seven pools of Hana on
                        the island of Maui...
 
                                  WOMAN
                        Gorgeous.
 
                                  JERRY
                        A year-and-a-half later, we were
                        both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl.
                        Now I've always hit a wall at 18
                        months.  Every serious girlfriend
                        lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka-
                        boom.  The curse of 18 months.
 
                                  WOMAN
                        That's when you need to cement,
                        and define define define.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Exactly.  And the world does not
                        need another 35 year-old bachelor.
                        I knew I wanted to propose, so I
                        took her there.
 
                                  WOMAN
                        To the pools?
 
                                  JERRY
                        To the pools.  Now she's Miss Rock
                        Climber, and I'm more the Non-Rock
                        Climber, but we're hiking up
                        through the pools and there's a
                        fine mist in the air, and I have
                        the ring in my pocket, and I'm a
                        little nervous, I'm lagging
                        behind, and she says to me, get
                        this -- "Hurry up, klutz."
 
                                  WOMAN
                        Oh no --


                                                                     14.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, it bothered me somewhat.
                        And I got quiet.  And now she's
                        quiet and we're both pouting a
                        little, you know.  And I decide
                        I'm not going to propose.  The
                        mood is not right. Why be
                        impulsive? Now at this point I
                        know she knows that I was going to
                        propose and didn't.  And she knows
                        I know.  So the entire sixty mile
                        ride back to the airport, we don't
                        speak. And we're both good at
                        that.  We fly to Honolulu in
                        silence.  We check into the Pro
                        Bowl hotel --
 
                                  WOMAN
                        How sad --
 
                                  JERRY
                        But wait...
 
              BACK TO DOROTHY
 
              She is now craning out into the aisle to hear this story.
              The plane is now quieter.  She listens to the easy sound of
              Jerry discussing his charmed life.
 
                                  RAY
                               (waking up)
                        Mama --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Shhh.  Mommy's eavesdropping.
 
              He sneezes, three big ones in a row.  She hands him more
              kleenex, riveted on the story.  And listens.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                        Now little do I know that my
                        assistant. has assumed that I've
                        now proposed. So she has gotten
                        the lounge band to actually play
                        "Here Comes The Bride" when we
                        walk back in.
 
              Dorothy laughs to herself, somewhat derisively.  She tries to
              share the laugh with her son, who stares at her.


                                                                     15.
 
 
              BACK TO JERRY -- LATER
 
                                  JERRY
                        Which they do.  And we're standing
                        there. All the football guys are
                        in the lobby, watching, there's
                        even an ESPN crew.  So I turn to
                        her and sort of grandly say,
                        "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking
                        you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to
                        marry me." And I took out the
                        ring, and I don't much like big
                        scenes, but she said "yes" right
                        there in the lobby and some of the
                        toughest men in football wept like
                        babies.  We're getting married in
                        February.
 
                                  WOMAN
                        Jerry.  You two will be together
                        forever.
 
              BACK TO DOROTHY
 
              She takes one of her son's kleenex sheets, as an elegant
              Flight Attendant shuts the curtain to first class. Dorothy
              blows her nose, moved against her will.
 
                                  RAY
                        What's wrong, mom?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        First class is what's wrong.  It
                        used to be a better meal.  Now
                        it's a better life.
 
              She pulls out the Mission Statement,  aware that she's been
              listening to its author.  She opens it and begins to read.
 
              INT. LAX AIRPORT TERMINAL -- MORNING
 
              Jerry Maguire exits the plane a few steps behind Bobbi Fallon.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (quietly, like a
                                coach)
                        You'll know when you see him.
                        You'll know when you see him.
 
              Bobbi scans the crowd. She spots Monkeyface, large and burly
              in tiger-print sweats.  He looks like Mickey Dolenz.  He
              holds flowers.


                                                                     16.
 
 
                                  WOMAN
                        Oh my God, you're right.  I know.
                               (Jerry smiles)
                        He's not The One.  He's not the
                        One.
 
              Jerry's face falls.  Bobbi Fallon moves into the embrace,
              faking it.  Jerry moves ahead, turning back to see the doomed
              couple. Melancholy now, he continues forward through the
              crowded airport and the expectant faces of those waiting for
              loved ones.  Music.
 
              INT. LUGGAGE AREA -- MORNING
 
              Dorothy looks through the rubber flaps of the luggage
              conveyor belt.  She clutches a cup of coffee.  In the
              background, other SMI agents' grab their bags and exit.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Ray! Ray!
 
              Maguire enters picture, joining her as she looks into the
              dark depths behind the flaps.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Can I help?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office.
                        I was on the junket to the
                        conference. I'm --
 
                                  JERRY
                        I know who y6u are.  You're
                        Dorothy Boyd.  You're in...
                        wait... you're in Accounts.  You
                        have the middle cubicle toward the
                        back with that poster of Albert
                        Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0
                        Neal's body.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (surprised)
                        Hmm.  Pretty good.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Now what did you lose?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        My son... my mind...
 
              Over her shoulder, Maguire sees Ray rounding the corner,
              riding the luggage conveyor belt like Washington crossing the
              Delaware.


                                                                     17.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, while I go look for him, why
                        don't you hang onto this curious
                        gentleman behind you --
 
              Dorothy turns, is greatly relieved to see Ray, and snatches
              him off the belt.  She bends down into his face.  She speaks
              softly but intensely, with no frills.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Remember "imagination?"...
                        remember what that means?  Well,
                        this is one of my bosses so you
                        will now IMAGINE me screaming at
                        you right now. Do NOT do that
                        again.  Ever ever EVER.
 
              She rises, shifting back to being a somewhat relaxed young
              woman of 26.  It's a transition she makes, oh, 500 times a
              day.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        Well, thanks.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, take care.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        And have fun at your bachelor
                        party.
 
              Jerry pauses just a moment, but it's long enough.  Dorothy
              freezes.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        Oh no.
 
                                  JERRY
                        No no. I knew.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (slow sigh)
                        Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.
 
                                  JERRY
                        No, I'm just... anxiously looking
                        past it.  I already had my
                        bachelor party.  It was called "my
                        twenties." See you later.
 
              Jerry takes off.


                                                                     18.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I loved your memo, by the way.
 
              He stops.  Turns.  She flashes the well-thumbed copy in her
              purse. Jerry takes a step closer, interested and flattered.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Thanks... actually, it was just a
                        "Mission Statement."
 
              Ray has taken Jerry's free hand, and begun swinging on him.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I think in this age, optimism like
                        that... it's a revolutionary act.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (eager for feedback)
                        You think so?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Oh tsht. Yes.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I appreciate that, because some of
                        that stuff... you know, it was two
                        in the morning and...
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        -- the part about "we should
                        embrace what it is still virginal
                        about our enthusiasm" --
 
              Jerry looks slightly edgy at the naked vulnerability of his
              words.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        -- "and we should all force open
                        the tightly-clenched fist of
                        commerce, and give a little back
                        for the greater good.". I mean, I
                        was inspired, and I'm an
                        accountant.  Ray, don't spill my
                        coffee.
 
              Jerry looks more nervous, as Ray has now taken his mother's
              hand. He is now swinging on both of them.
 
                                  RAY
                        One-two-three... swing.


                                                                     19.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Hey.  To respect yourself enough
                        to say it out loud, to put
                        yourself out there, so openly...
                               (shakes her head)
                        ... I don't know, it got me.
 
              Now Jerry looks concerned, as Ray continues swinging happily.
 
                                  RAY
                        One-two-three, swing.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Thanks.  May I offer you both a
                        ride?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Oh no.  I'm sure it would just
                        make your day to drive us all the
                        way to Manhattan Beach, taking
                        that left down to little tiny
                        Waterloo street where you have to
                        play chicken with oncoming
                        traffic, and your life flashes
                        before your eyes, but -- hey, I've
                        obviously had too much coffee and
                        all -- here's my sister Laurel to
                        pick us up.  Thanks, though. Bye.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (amused)
                        Dorothy.  Ray.  A pleasure.
 
                                  RAY
                        One-two...
 
              Jerry lets Ray down easy.  The kid is a little disappointed.
              But Maguire bows, always courtly, and exits to get his bag.
              He then realizes something amiss and returns quickly, pulling
              Ray's hand up again and completing the swing.
 
                                  JERRY
                        ... three, swing.
 
              Ray is now happy, in love even, as Jerry exits.  Dorothy
              laughs, as her sister arrives. LAUREL BOYD is 36. No make-up,
              no bullshit. Laurel has a pin on her sweater, which catches
              on dorothy's shirt as they hug.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Come on, I'm double-parked.
 
              Dorothy returns to the world of motherhood, bending down,
              gathering Ray's toys.  She wipes at Ray's hair.


                                                                     20.
 
 
              ("Don't put food in your hair.")   She is surprised that
              she's a little jazzed from her encounter with Jerry Maguire.
              She can't help but look back at Jerry, who catches her
              looking.   He salutes her, with mock circumstance.  She
              returns it with a guilty smile.  He disappears, and she finds
              herself oddly short of breath.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (to herself)
                        Hmmph.  Whoever snagged him must
                        be some classy babe --
 
              INT. AVERY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
 
              AVERY BISHOR, 29, makes love to Jerry Maguire at fever pitch.
              They are standing on the bed, which is in the corner.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Don't ever stop fucking me!
 
                                  JERRY
                        Sooner... or later... I'll have to
                        stop.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Oh Gawd, oh yes, it's never been
                        better. Never BETTER!!
 
              Nearby, a large and sleepy German Shepard yawns.
 
                                  AVERY
                               (continuing)
                        Never BETTER!!
 
              The dog snaps awake, a little shook.  Avery suddenly yanks
              away. Breathing hard, she just looks at Jerry. Sex is a very
              serious business with Avery.
 
                                  AVERY
                               (continuing)
                        Open your eyes.
                               (he does)
                        If you ever want me to be with
                        another woman for you, I would do
                        it.  I'm not interested in it.
                        There was a time, yes, it felt
                        normal for me, but it was a phase,
                        a college thing, like torn Levi's
                        or law school for you... people
                        change, but if you ever feel like
                        being adventurous in that way, I
                        would do it for you.  You want
                        anything from the kitchen I'm
                        going to get some fruit --


                                                                     21.
 
 
              She skips off like a colt.  Jerry digests what he's just been
              told.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (to the next room)
                        You know.  I don't think we need
                        to do the thing where we tell each
                        other everything!
 
                                  AVERY (O.S.)
                               (laughing)
                        Jerry, this is what intimacy is!
 
              Jerry rubs his face, as he does often when processing complex
              information.
 
                                  AVERY (0.5.)
                        Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we
                        have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
 
                                  JERRY (0.5.)
                        I know about the bachelor party.
 
              Avery returns.  Her robo body, half-lit now in the hallway,
              is a glorious life-long project.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Who told you?
 
                                  JERRY
                        One of the accountants.
 
              She makes a pissed-off sound.  She then walks over, taking
              his shoulders and bending them forward.  She is an expert at
              body manipulation, loosening him as she talks.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Jerry.  Your buddy Dooler worked
                        his ass off to make you a tribute
                        film. All those guys from the
                        office are coming.  Everybody
                        loves you.  Just calm down, relax,
                        act surprised, and have an amazing
                        time.  And you'll never guess who
                        narrates your bachelor movie.
 
              INT. FANCY HOTEL SUITE -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry enters the hotel suite and over-acts surprise.  He
              falls down, clutching his heart, feigning an attack. He looks
              around for a bigger reaction than he actually gets.
 
              THE FILM -- SHOWN ON BIG-SCREEN T.V.
 
              It is hosted by MICHAEL JORDAN.


                                                                     22.
 
 
                                  MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I have often wondered where my
                        career would have been had Jerry
                        Maguire been my agent.  The
                        answer -- Yugoslavia.
 
              Tepid laughs, as many of the agents turn and grab furtive
              looks at Maguire, who stands at the back of the room with his
              friend BILL DOOLER.  Dooler, husky, 30, looks like a beatnik
              on steroids.
 
                                  DOOLER
                        You hear those courtesy laughs,
                        Jerry? There is a seething
                        wrongness at the edges of this
                        party.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Oh come on --
 
                                  DOOLER
                        This is fuckin Michael Jordan,
                        man! They should be screaming.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (eying crowd)
                        You're imagining it.
 
              They are joined by unctuous agent Bob Sugar.  Sugar is a
              Maguire wannabee.  Puts an arm on Jerry's shoulder.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        We still having lunch tomorrow,
                        Jerry?  Looks like Carl Denton
                        tested positive for marijuana.
                        That moves Cush solidly up to
                        numero uno in the draft.
 
                                  DOOLER
                        Oh, that'll really help this
                        party! Let's all talk business!
 
                                  JERRY
                        Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (smoothly)
                        The best commercial director in
                        the business.  I hail you.
 
                                  DOOLER
                        Sorry I yelled.  You have
                        exquisite taste.


                                                                     23.
 
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Everybody's having a great time.
                        You're both nuts -- the movie's
                        great.
 
              Sugar moves on, cheerfully.
 
                                  DOOLER
                        I like that guy.
 
              (The movie, which plays simultaneously with the conversation,
              is a Hi-8 confessional of Jerry's former girlfriends.
              MICHAEL JORDAN is cut into this, nodding, as if he were
              actually interviewing.  The effect is funny, but the
              confessions are brutally honest.  There is The One He Was Too
              Good For, The One He Wasn't Good Enough For ("He hated being
              alone.") The Still in Love Girlfriend, The Punk Rock
              girlfriend ("Sports makes me ill"), The Now Married With Kids
              Girlfriend, The Cynical Girlfriend ("Beneath the cute
              exterior, more cute exterior.") The Purely Sexual Girlfriend,
              The Brainy Girlfriend, ("Great at friendship, bad at
              intimacy") and even the Girlfriend Who Does A Great Jerry
              Imitation (rubbing her face, she does a flawless Jerry-on-his-
              way-to-the-airport).  All seem to agree on some basic points
              (and if necessary maybe Jordan narrates the following
              information to underscore it.)  Jerry always has a
              girlfriend, and many met him on the first day he'd broken up
              with the last one.  The relationship always competes with his
              job, and the job always wins.  The final confrontation
              happens somewhere around the 18-month mark. Sequence ends
              with Avery in character, wielding a blowtorch, threatening to
              burn all these old phone numbers.)
 
                                  JERRY
                               (wounded good sport)
                        ... this is... uh... too funny...
 
                                  DOOLER
                        They ain't laughing, man.
                        Something's wrong.
 
              Jerry nods, takes a swig of beer.  He knows the response is
              little more than polite.  None of the other agents can keep
              eye contact with him.  Dooler is right.  On the screen, the
              finale features a good-humored collage of Jerry photos, cut
              to music.
 
              INT. SMI OFFICE -- DAY
 
              Elevator doors open.  Maguire is now paranoid.  He walks
              through the buzzing SMI headquarters, heading for his corner
              office.  He is like an FBI man searching treetops and corners
              for the Gunman. Everywhere he looks is a potential Grassy
              Knoll.


                                                                     24.
 
 
              He passes Fellow Agents, always smiling, giving a word of
              encouragement to an Agent having an emotional hallway
              conversation with an Athlete, even bends down to check the
              sheet of slides being approved by a very large but seated
              Basketball Player. Moving forward. There is trouble in the
              air, but only he seems to sense it.  He turns corner and is
              met by assistant WENDY, who hands him a long list of calls.
              The sheet flaps against his leg as she moves with him toward
              his back office.
 
                                  WENDY
                               (as in 'get ready')
                        Marcee's here.  She's already in
                        your office.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Thanks, Wendy.
 
              INT. JERRY MAGUIRE'S OFFICE -- DAY
 
              Jerry enters his corner office overlooking both the shiny
              waters of Newport Beach and a large mall parking lot. Already
              standing, reading the mail on his desk is lively MARCEE
              TIDWELL, 25. African-American, gorgeous, a heat-seeking
              smartbomb.  She is also five months pregnant.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Marcee.  How's my favorite
                        player's wife?
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Jerry, Rod is very very upset.
                        Tyson, no!
 
              Across the room, 4 year-old menace TYSON ceases trying to pry
              a plexiglass case off the wall.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Tyson, hello.
 
              Tyson just stares at Jerry.  Jerry has little luck with kids.
              He gives Marcee a quick peck and heads for the fridge.  He
              grabs a two-pint bottle of orange Gatorade -- another
              habit -- and sits down at his desk.  He slips into crisis
              mode like an old shirt.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        How can I make your life better?
 
                                  MARCEE
                        I know you say to take the Arizona
                        offer, but my husband needs more
                        recognition.
                                  (more)


                                                                     25.
 
 
                                  MARCEE (cont'd)
                        He is the biggest, fastest,
                        raddest wide-receiver in the
                        league.  Now I don't know what you
                        do for your four-percent
 
              --The door opens, Bob Sugar pokes his head in.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Cronin's okay for lunch?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Marcee -- this is one of our
                        agents. This is Bob Sugar, who
                        needs to learn to knock.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Pleasure.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        You've called our house, right?
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Sorry to interrupt you guys.
 
              Sugar exits.  Marcee resumes at the exact point, at the exact
              level of intensity.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Now I don't know what you do for
                        your five-percent, but this man,
                        my husband has a whole plan, an
                        image... we majored in marketing,
                        Jerry, and when you put him in a
                        Waterbed Warehouse commercial,
                        excuse me, you are making him
                        common.  He is pure gold and
                        you're giving him "Waterbed
                        Warehouse" when he deserves the
                        big four -- shoe, car, clothing-
                        line, soft-drink.  The four jewels
                        of the celebrity endorsement
                        dollar.
 
              Jerry finds himself admiring her drive, and she commands the
              best in him.  The desk buzzes, and Jerry ignores it.
 
                                  MARCEE
                               (continuing)
                        You gonna get that --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Not a chance.
 
              She smiles.

                                                                     26.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Marcee, things are changing around
                        here.  You and Rod will have my
                        total personal attention.
 
                                  MARCEE
                               (upping the ante)
                        Damn right, and you can start by
                        taking Rod's poster and putting it
                        where people can see it!
 
                                  JERRY
                               (it's infectious)
                        Damn right.
 
              He climbs up on the edge of his sofa, and reaches for the
              poster with his hanging device. True to Marcee's complaint,
              the poster hangs in the upper Siberian region of his wall.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Look at that handsome man, trying
                        to build a life up there by the
                        air-conditioner. We're coming to
                        get ya, darlin!  We are so close
                        to having it all!
 
              ON THE POSTER -- CLOSE
 
              It is the kind of poster that is strictly the domain of
              second-tier players. Commanding wide-receiver ROD TIDWELL,
              27, stands shirtless, hands on hips, looking vaguelyl
              uncomfortable. Emplazoned above his head: IN ROD WE TRUST.
              Elsewhere in the room, we hear the inevitable crash
              ("Tyson!").
 
              EXT. CRONIN'S GRILL -- AFTERNOON
 
              Crowded outdoor restaurant in the business district. Jerry
              sits down opposite Bob Sugar, still making a few notes.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Gimme a second here... Tidwell...
                        Arizona contract... new glass
                        cabinet...
 
                                  SUGAR
                        You okay?
 
                                  JERRY
                               (looking up)
                        I'm fine.  What's up?
 
                                  SUGAR
                        I came here to let you go.


                                                                     27.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Pardon me?
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Came here to fire you, Jerry.
 
              For a long moment there is only silence.  They study each
              other. These are two smart boys, each one anticipating the
              other's next three or four moves.
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (continuing)
                        It's real, Jerry.  You... you
                        should say something.
 
              Suddenly he's flushed, a little embarrassed.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Aw shit...the crowded
                        restaurant... so there's no
                        scene...
 
                                  SUGAR
                        I know.  It sucks.  I suck.
 
              In a back room, the waiters are singing the restaurant's
              "Birthday Song" to someone else. Jerry is dying.
 
                                  JERRY
                        You...
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (razor sharp)
                        You did this to yourself.  You
                        said "fewer clients."  You put it
                        all on paper.  Scully was very
                        upset.  Heart attacks make some
                        people sweeter, but not him.  You
                        did this to yourself --
 
              Jerry's mouth opens to finish his sentence, but before he can
              speak, Sugar continues.
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (continuing)
                        -- although I do gotta hand it to
                        you.  For about five minutes you
                        had everyone applauding smaller
                        revenues.
 
              Quietly, Maguire finishes the sentence he started earlier.
 
                                  JERRY
                        You... ungrateful... unctuous...


                                                                     28.
 
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (unctuous)
                        ... dick?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Dick.
 
              Maguire reaches for water.  The sound of the ice cubes
              jangling is suddenly very loud to him. He is drowning.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Give me a little credit for doing
                        this face-to-face!  What I went
                        through knowing I was going to do
                        this to my mentor!  Can you get
                        past yourself for a second?
 
                                  JERRY
                        You'll lose.
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (musically)
                        You wanted smaller.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'm over it.  Now I want all my
                        clients and yours too.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Jerry --
 
                                  JERRY
                        -- and I'll get 'em.
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (patronizing)
                        You'll always be my hero, Jerry.
                        Always always always.  We're
                        bringing other elements in, we're
                        focusing on endorsements -- it's
                        not about handholding anymore.
                        We're no longer babysitters --
 
              Jerry fights the desire to use his fists.  Hangs onto the
              table. He's starting to freak out now. Trying to calm down.
              Sugar's mouth keeps moving, but we hear the music in Jerry's
              mind.  Rising percussive music.
 
              EXT. STREET -- DAY
 
              Jerry tries to move briskly down the street, through the
              lunchtime businessmen traffic. Back to the office.


                                                                     29.
 
 
              INT. CRONIN'S -- DAY
 
              Sugar dines alone now.  Casually whips out a portable phone.
 
              INT. SMI ELEVATOR -- DAY
 
              Jerry in the elevator, eyes wide, mind racing.  Dorothy Boyd
              sees him, raises a hand to say hello.  Decides this is not a
              good time.
 
              INT. SMI OFFICE -- DAY
 
              Close on Maguire as he moves through the office, heading to
              the back office.  Music
 
              INT. JERRY'S OFFICE -- DAY
 
              Maguire rolls the fax machine over to his desk.  He takes a
              breath, and begins to go to work. From within his bottom
              drawer, he withdraws a Powerbook.  Then from another drawer,
              a phone book. And then from his inner jacket pocket, a third
              smaller phone book. They are lined in front of him now, as he
              dials.
 
              INT. CUSHMAN HOME/ODESSA -- DAY
 
              Frank "Cush" Cushman picks up the phone.  Today, the young
              football God wears a yellow scarf on his head. He's still
              playing NBA Jam on his Gameboy' as he talks.
 
              EXT. CRONIN'S -- DAY
 
              Sugar at the table.  Chameleon-like, he adopts the
              personality of whomever he talks to.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Cush.  Hey Dudeboy!  It's Bob
                        Sugar. Listen, I'm callin' ya
                        first 'cause you're the most
                        important guy in sports...
 
              INT. JERRY'S OFFICE -- DAY
 
              Maguire on the telephone, fighting hard, as he feeds a fax
              into the machine at the same time.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Carla, right now you're paying 25%
                        of your endorsments to SMI, I
                        would cut my commission by 7%...
 
              As he talks, he takes a stack of his Mission Statements, once
              proudly set on his desk, and sentences them to the bottom
              drawer.


                                                                     30.
 
 
              EXT. STREET -- DAY
 
              Sugar strolls back to the office, talking on the portable.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        You read that memo I snuck to you,
                        the guy's tired of the job.  Tired
                        of making you money.
 
              INT. JERRY'S OFFICE -- DAY
 
              Maguire feeds a fax, types another fax on his Powerbook, all
              while he talks quickly on the phone.
 
                                  JERRY
                        And when I got you that big
                        contract in Chicago, and the fan
                        poll in the Sun-Times was 93%
                        against you, who went and found
                        you that sympathetic journalist

              Dorothy walks the center hallway with some contracts.  To the
              right and left of her are the phones are ringing.


                                                                     31.
 
 
              Something is amiss. She stops at the desk of fellow Accounts

                        They fired Jerry Maguire.  Did it
                        at Cronin's.
 
              Dorothy groans softly, as she lowers herself into her seat.
              She is strangely affected by the news. She scoots back on her
              roller chair, and looks down the hallway to Maguire's office
              door.

              KATHY SANDERS, 22 year-old figure skater, sits on a couch.
              Nearby are cardboard stand-ups, souvenirs of past
              endorsements. Also, the famous gold-medal shot from the
              Olympics. Kathy's adoring Mom and Dad sit next to her,
              listening in on the extension.  The Mission Statement is
              folded open on Dad's lap.  Kathy chokes on every other word,
              such is her anguish.

                        Jerry I want to cry for what they
                        did to you at SMI.  You helped me

              There is a click on the line.  She is pained and outraged.

              ROD TIDWELL, 27, begins this conversation in the kitchen.  He
              is a powerful physical presence, and he holds a hot new
              cellular phone. He fixes young son Tyson a bowl of cereal as
              he talks.  In the background, monitoring the crisis is Marcee
              Tidwell.
 
                                  ROD TIDWELL
                        "How am I doing?"  I'll tell you.

              minutes on each call.

              He covers the phone, as another agent hands him a cellular
              with another call on it.

              Back to the other call.

              Tidwell walks down the hallway, past clippings and citations
              from his career. Marcee follows, always listening.

                        commodity.  I go across the
                        middle. I see the ball and a dude
                        coming right at me, wanting to
                        kill me, I tell my brain "get

              We meet the messy-haired and slightly overweight brother of
              Tidwell, TEE PEE, 24.  Tee Pee, who lives free of charge in
              Rod's house, is a nakedly jealous and more political version
              of his brother.  He says into the phone:
 
                                  TEE PEE
                        Hello Jerry Maguire.

              Tidwell takes the phone back, and continues through the
              house, with Tee Pee now following the procession of family
              monitoring the important call.

                        to be a "superstar," man!  Are you

                        agent.
 
              Tidwell hangs up.  Feeling good about the decision, he enters
              his closet and adds today's shoes to an enormous shoe
              collection. Nearby, Tee Pee shakes his head.

                        An African-American man running
                        with a little ball, working for
                        white owners and white agents.
                        It's the iconography of rascism...
                               (off Tidwell's
                                dismissive look)
                        ... but I woulda stayed at the
                        bigger company.
 
              INT. SUGAR'S OFFICE -- DAY
 
              Sugar crosses the last call off his sheet, and throws himself
              on the sofa.  He lands in reclining mode with a soft pooof.
              The younger turks watch their new leader.  Victory is his.
 
              INT. JERRY'S OFFICE -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry stands at the door, holding some belongings.  He looks
              back and symbolically flips the light switch off.
              Unfortunately he hasn't realized the lights are already off.
              So, in his final gesture, surprising himself, he has weirdly
              turned the lights on.
 
              EXT. CORNER OFFICE -- NIGHT
 
              Bam.  Jerry's door opens.  He exits his office with box.  He
              is now in a state of advancing melancholy, slightly unhinged.
              Many of the other agents now try not to watch him leaving.


                                                                     37.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, don't worry!  I'm not going
                        to do what you think I'm going to
                        do, which is FLIP OUT!
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
 
              Jerry goes to a water dispenser, calming himself, and fills
              a small Dixie cup.  Downs it and fills it again, rubbing his
              face..
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        But let me just say, as I ease out
                        of the office I helped build --
                        sorry, but it's a fact --
 
              ON DOROTHY -- WATCHING
 
              from her cubicle.
 
                                  JERRY
                        -- that there is such a thing as
                        manners.  A way of treating
                        people...
 
              He notices the fish tank nearby. He attemps to be profound.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        These fish have manners!  They
                        have manners.
 
              And now Jerry feels bravado, mixed with a wave of anger.
              Another cup of water as he finds power.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        In fact.  They're coming with me!
                        I'm starting a new company, and
                        the fish will come with me and...
                        you can call me sentimental.
 
              He begins dipping into the tank, grabbing the one exotic fish
              that failed to escape his cup. It's a fire-tailed Peruvian
              beauty.  He grabs a baggie from an assistant's desk, shakes
              out some crumbs, and dumps the fish inside.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing; to fish)
                        it's okay... it's okay...
 
              Nearby, a Xerox Repair Guy watches the human train wreck.


                                                                     38.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        But if anybody else wants to come
                        with me, this moment will be the
                        ground floor of something real and
                        fun and inspiring and true in this
                        godforsaken business and we will
                        do it together!  Who's coming with
                        me besides... "Flipper" here?
 
              But clearly even Flipper is not happy with the new
              arrangement. Panicked, he whips around the small baggie.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Anybody going with me?
 
              Silence, someone coughs, as agents and office personnel look
              on with equal parts pity and embarrassment. Jerry downs
              another small cup of water. His lid is blowing off with each
              second.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Wendy?  Shall we?
 
              Assistant Wendy looks at Maguire.  Painfully polite:
 
                                  WENDY
                        I'm three months away from the pay
                        increase, Jerry.  I have to, uh...
                        you know, stay.
 
              Jerry absorbs the blow, and takes the keys from the top of
              her desk.  She can't look at him.  Jerry stands alone, the
              blue Mission Statement on Wendy's desk sits accusingly in
              frame.  There is only silence now, the loudest kind.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Okay, anybody else?
 
              ON DOROTHY
 
              She looks around.  Doesn't anybody believe in the very thing
              they were applauding three days ago?  She has an odd
              reaction, a muscle twitch of the soul.   Before she knows it,
              she stands boldly, unfortunately knocking a cup of coffee
              onto herself in the process.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I'll go with you.
                               (quietly, on her
                                coffee mess)
                        Wonderful...


                                                                     39.
 
 
              She dabs at her pants.  Next to her, Cleo looks on sadly.
 
              ON JERRY
 
              halfway across the office.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Dorothy Boyd!  Thank you!
 
              She gathers her things, increasingly aware of what she's done.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        We will see you all again.  Sleep
                        tight!
 
              He walks to Dorothy, and together they exit down the hallway
              corridor, past the framed posters and awards.
 
              WIDE-SHOT
 
              rising over the huge office.  For the first time, we see the
              full expanse of the huge SMI headquarters.  And down in the
              corner of the frame, two small figures leave carrying boxes.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (to Dorothy)
                        Let's see how they do without us.
 
              A beat of silence, then noise returns to its normal
              commercial roar.  A couple of fleas have been swatted off the
              carcass of an immense beast.
 
              INT. ELEVATOR -- NIGHT
 
              The tragic-sounding beep of the elevator passing floors.
              Jerry Maguire stands with Dorothy, both still charged with
              adrenalin. And then the first pangs of dread. There is
              silence.  The elevator stops.  A young, amorous Couple
              enters.  Both are about 24, and the Guy presses a number five
              flights down.  In a moment, we realize they are deaf.  They
              sign to each other, murmuring noises of love. And then the
              Guy signs something, obviously powerful, because the Girl
              emits a delighted gasp, as does Dorothy.  The Couple are
              truly in their own world.  They kiss before exiting on their
              floor.  And suddenly the elevator seems empty without them.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Wonder what he said.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        My favorite aunt is hearing
                        impaired. He said "you complete
                        me."


                                                                     40.
 
 
              They continue on in silence.
 
              INT. BUILDING LOBBY -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry and Dorothy pass through another office's party.  Loud
              music. It's a pre-Easter party thrown for the building
              employees and their children.  Jerry and Dorothy squeeze
              through with boxes and fish.
 
              EXT. SMI PARKING LOT -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry and Dorothy walk to their cars.  Music in distance.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        So I know this is a bad time,
                        but -- you will have a medical
                        program, right?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know.
 
              He spaces out for a moment.  Awkwardly, she touches him
              briefly.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        And I guess we didn't talk about
                        money.  So, I'll just dive in --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Give me your number.  I'll call
                        tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm
                        a little insane right now.
                               (off her look)
                        But it's going to be great.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        No no, I know --
 
              They arrive at her red Camry.  She writes her number on the
              back of a business card.
 
                                  JERRY
                        But I mean really... wonderfully...
                               (out of steam)
                        great.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (unsure)
                        Absolutely.
 
              She climbs into her car, rolls down the window.
 
                                  JERRY
                        And when you think about what
                        you've done later, don't panic.


                                                                     41.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Me?  No.  My sister -- it's a good
                        bet.
 
              She starts the engine.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        That took guts.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Same to you.
 
              She salutes him as she drives off.  His own move, played back
              to him.  Camera moves away from Jerry, as he stands alone in
              the parking lot.  Salutes her in return.  Herb Alpert.  "The
              Lonely Bull." Stripped of power, his once mighty theme now
              seems puny.
 
                                                       FADE TO
 
              EXT. DOROTHY'S HOME -- NIGHT
 
              Lights glow inside this small-but-cozy home on a side street
              in Manhattan Beach. Windows open.  The sound of women's
              voices.
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              A living room filled with ten earnest, talkative Divorced
              Women. This is their talk group.  We meet JAN, 30, who speaks
              shyly, thoughtfully, covering her braces often as she speaks.
              She holds a too-full glass of red wine.  (Much of the talk in
              this Women's Group will be improved by our cast of actresses)
 
                                  JAN
                        I love men.  I respect men.  But
                        that doesn't change the fact that
                        most of them belong in cages...
 
              The other nine women nod with deep understanding.
 
              INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT
 
              Dorothy does the dishes.  Across the room, Laurel has her
              nightly cigarette, blowing smoke out the window.  She is a no-
              frills woman. She has some time ago shut off those aspects of
              her life spent pursuing the opposite sex.  They are in mid-
              argument.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        What about medical?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Of course, medical!


                                                                     42.
 
 
                                  LAUREL
                               (unconvinced)
                        You are a single mother.  You have
                        given up the right to be frivolous.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (irritated)
                        If you'd read what he wrote, you
                        would have left with him too.
 
                                  LAUREL
                               (more irritated)
                        You know how much those Well Child

                                  DOROTHY
                               (overlapping)
                        Of course I know --
 
                                  LAUREL/DOROTHY
                        A hundred and fifty dollars.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        And that's just when he's well --
 
              They talk over each other arguing for a moment and then:
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Wait. Where is he?
 
                                  LAUREL
                        He's in the living room asleep.
 
              Dorothy dries her hands, flicking in a hurry.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Wonderful.  Next time you lecture
                        me, don't leave my little boy in
                        a room with your Divorced Women's
                        Group...
 
              She exits in a hurry, as Laurel throws her cigarette into the
              garbage disposal.  She has a hard time saying this, so she
              says it so nobody can hear:
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Sorry.
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Ray dreams sweetly in the middle of this rockbed of Women's
              Woes. Dorothy strokes his head, as she plucks him up.  In
              frame another woman, ALICE, 50, speaks passionately to the
              group.


                                                                     43.
 
 
                                  ALICE
                        Okay I've finally, finally, gotten
                        my anger straight here.  I'm going
                        to visualize Carl being here and
                        finally tell him --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Shhhh!
 
              Dorothy exits, protectively stroking her son's head.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        Come on, buddy, we're going to bed.
 
              INT. HALLWAY-- NIGHT
 
              She stops for a moment, little boy in her hands.  The
              enormity of the day arrives with a thud.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (to herself)
                        What did I do?
 
              INT. JERRY'S CONDO -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry is quickly packing for a road trip.  Avery looks on.
              They are both in a manic state.
 
                                  JERRY
                        The power move is to go
                        unannounced.
                               (sotto)
                        Black suit, right?
 
                                  AVERY
                               (sotto)
                        And the egyptian cotton shirt that
                        works with or without the jacket.
                               (full volume)
                        Tell me again, how was it left
                        with Cush?
 
                                  JERRY
                               (perfect imitation)
                        "Dad says we gwan sleep on it.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Ugh!
 
                                  JERRY
                               (turns, with clothes)
                        Seventy-two clients.  ONE stayed.
                               (sotto)
                        Jacket on, tie in pocket.


                                                                     44.
 
 
                                  AVERY
                               (sotta)
                        Good.
                               (full volume)
                        They're all heatseekers!  All of
                        them, everybody. You keep one
                        superstar and they'll all follow.
                        There's no real loyalty, and the
                        first person who told me that,
                        Jerry Maguire, was you.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I think I was trying to sleep with
                        you at the time.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Well, it worked, and I will not
                        let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma-
                        fuckin-guire.
 
                                  JERRY
                        That's right.
 
                                  AVERY
                        King of the Housecalls! Master of
                        the Living Room!
 
                                  JERRY
                        Okay, this is working.
 
                                  AVERY
                        You are not a loser.
 
              Jerry stops, turns.  The way she says "loser" is the most
              elegant of disses. She wraps her lips around it like a cheap
              hot dog.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Who said anything about "loser?"
                        Where do you get this word "loser?"
 
                                  AVERY
                        I'm sorry.  I was on a roll.  I
                        meant something else.  When do you
                        want to leave?
 
              Jerry zips his brown travel bag shut.  He is packed and ready.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Now.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Let's go.  I'll drive you.


                                                                     45.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (stops, an odd
                                thought)
                        What if I don't get him?
 
              Avery takes his bag, heads for the door.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Function function function.
                        Forward motion is everything.
                        Cush saves all.
 
              Jerry takes a breath, exits.  Music.
 
              AIRPLANE WHEELS
 
              folding up.  Music continues.
 
              INT. RENT-A-CAR -- MORNING
 
              Jerry drives the bumpiest Texas backroad ever.
 
              Music continues.
 
              EXT. CUSHMAN DOOR -- DAY
 
              Jerry exits car.  Adjusts the jacket.  Takes the tie off too,
              returns to the car and tosses it inside.  He walks to the
              front door with purpose.  Suddenly an intercom crackles,
              jolting him with a booming and cheerful voice:
 
                                  MATT CUSHMAN'S VOICE
                        No sports agents allowed!  Ha ha.
 
              Jerry spots the small electronic camera pointed at him from
              the upper-corner of this rustic home.  The door buzzes.
 
              INT. CUSHMAN HALLWAY/DEN -- DAY
 
              Jerry  follows the voice down a hallway  loaded with Cush
              memorabilia.  Righteous indignation building.
 
                                  MATT CUSHMAN'S VOICE
                        I'm in the back den, Jerry.
 
              He moves into the den, finding MATT CUSHMAN, 40, who stands
              at the living room bar. Two framed game jerseys on the wall.
              A large draped American flag above the bar.  He is a J. Crew
              cowboy.
 
                                  MATT
                        You like a Bloody Beer, Jerry?
                        Beer and tomato juice --


                                                                     46.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        No thanks.
 
              Maguire takes a breath, and sharply begins his pitch.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Matt, I came here because in all
                        honesty your son is just another
                        piece of cattle to SMI.  But to
                        me --
 
                                  MATT
                               (overlapping)
                        We decided to stay with you.
 
              On pure instinct, he hugs Matt Cushman.  The move surprises
              them both.  And somewhere out of nowhere, come a few
              surprising tears of relief.  He has been spared.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Oh, thank you.
 
                                  MATT
                        Told myself -- if he shows up,
                        we'll stick with him.
 
                                  JERRY
                        You know, I'm not a hugger and
                        yet... I can't let go.
 
              Matt laughs, as Cush lopes in from the kitchen.  Little
              brother KEITH, 14, enters with him.
 
                                  CUSH
                        Hey, Jerry, what's been going on?
 
              INT. DEN -- LATER DAY -- HANDHELD
 
              Cush, Matt and Jerry brainstorm around the ceremonial "wagon-
              wheel table" where decisions are made in this house.  Jerry
              is giddy, charged up, a part of the human race again.
 
                                  MATT
                        I want him to go number one in the
                        draft, and I want him to play.
 
                                  JERRY
                        It's either going to be Denver or
                        San Diego trading up to take him.
 
                                  CUSH
                               (big grin)
                        Hell, I'll either surf or ski. I
                        don't care.


                                                                     47.
 
 
                                  MATT
                        Denver is where he should be.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'll give it everything.
 
                                  MATT
                        You know I don't do "contracts."
                        But'cha do have my word, and it's
                        stronger than oak.
 
              Jerry toasts Matt with a bloody beer.  A good day.
 
              INT. RENT-A-CAR/TEXAS -- DAY
 
              Jerry drives back on the same bumpy road.  On the radio, it's
              the Rolling Stones.  He wants to sing along.  He thinks he
              knows the words, but...
 
                                  JERRY
                               (sings)
                        Feelin...
 
              He realizes he doesn't know the words at all. He switches
              channels. Finds a Rush song, with ornate lyrics.  No one will
              ever know what the words are.  He switches again and finds
              "Let's Groove Tonight" by Earth, Wind and Fire. Excellent.
              He begins singing nonsense noises, passionately.  Switches
              again.  All he wants is to sing along with a song he knows.
              Finally he finds Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' "Refugee."
              He drives through the countryside, singing the call and
              response of the song, like a happy idiot.
 
              INT. DALLAS/FT. WORTH AIRPORT -- DAY
 
              Jerry turns into shot.  He's on the pay-phone.  He's jacked.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Dorothy? Jerry Maguire!  Is Avery
                        there? Where can I reach her?
 
                                                       INTERCUT
 
 
 
              INT. DOROTHY/LAUREL'S HOUSE -- DAY
 
              Dorothy is at her home work desk.  Curious and nervous about
              the new arrangement.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Uh, she had to fly to Atlanta,
                        didn't leave me her hotel number.


                                                                     48.
 
 
              Through the back kitchen door comes CHAD THE NANNY, 29, red
              hair cropped above the ear. Baggy overalls.  Slipping through
              life with little turbulence.  He's with Ray, who holds pieces
              of wood and a hammer.
 
                                  CHAD
                        The new playhouse rocks, Dotty.
 
                                  RAY
                               (jumping)
                        Yeah!
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Honey -- later, okay?
                               (Ray jumps on her)
                        Whoop.  Wait.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Hello?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (back to phone)
                        Sorry, that's my son and the
                        nanny. I had the calls transferred
                        to my home so I could go over your
                        stuff.
 
              Chad now notices the slight excited tone in her demeanor.  He
              sits down nearby and listens to her talk to Maguire.
 
                                  JERRY
                        No, that's fine.  What calls came
                        in today?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Wait.  That's yesterday, from the
                        other office. Today is...
 
              She flips the call record from yesterday --150 calls -- to
              today, which is blank.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        ... light.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Shit, it's just so frustrating to
                        not be able to talk to Avery --
 
                                  AVERY
                        Wait a minute, it has to be one of
                        the NFL hotels we do business
                        with -- let me look -- but in the
                        meantime, about this job --


                                                                     49.
 
 
              She reaches over Ray to get to her laptop and buzzes through
              a list of phone numbers.  Jerry can't help but share the qood
              news:
 
                                  JERRY
                               (importantly)
                        Dorothy, let me tell you
                        something, we are back. We are so
                        very very back.  I re-signed Cush.
                        We're set.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        We are?
 
                                  JERRY
                        It's all going to work.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I just got goosebumps.
 
              She examines her own skin with surprise.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (manic, quiet)
                        It's all going to work.  We're
                        going to save the world.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Well, I'm happy for you.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Happy for us.
 
              Oddly, the phrase affects her physically.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Happy for us... okay.  Here's the
                        number. 404-453-2222.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Thanks.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Call me later, hon.
 
              She hangs up, and looks over to Laurel and Chad. Both of them
              stare at her.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        Wait.  Did I just say "hon" to him?
 
                                  CHAD
                               (laughing)
                        Yeah, Dotty. You did.


                                                                     50.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Twenty six years old.  I'm already
                        saying "hon". Hug your mother
                        quickly --
 
              Chad looks at her, something is different about Dorothy.
              Laurel walks away, sharing a look with Chad.
 
              INT. DALLAS AIRPORT -- DAY
 
              Jerry is now teeming with energy, professional and sexual.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Avery, I signed Cush.  Again.
 
                                                       INTERCUT
 
              INT. ATLANTA HOTEL SUITE -- DAY
 
              Avery in mid-conference with four other NFL men in background.
 
                                  AVERY
                        YA-HOOOO-SIE!
 
              It is the victory call of the competitive girl, and she falls
              back into a chair, kicking her expensive shoes onto the bed.
              In the b.g. we see the hungry look of her male co-workers.
              Part of them lusts after her.  The larger part knows she
              would demolish them, and pick her teeth with their bones.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I know.  Sorry I threw a scare
                        into our lives there --
 
                                  AVERY
                        Don't worry about it -- I never
                        told you what I thought of that
                        memo either --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, no you didn't --
 
                                  AVERY
                        You lost your head, it happens.
                               (quickly)
                        I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen.
                        I'm going to have to fly to
                        Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we
                        meet in the Dallas airport and we
                        all fly into New York together for
                        the draft?
 
                                  JERRY
                        It's a plan --  --


                                                                     51.
 
 
                                  AVERY
                        I'll set it up with your girl.
                        Woo!  This is when it's good,
                        Jerry. Enjoy it. Live it.  Love
                        it.  And when I see you, I'm going
                        to give you the best blow job of
                        your life.
 
              He hangs up, staring at the phone. In the room with Avery,
              the co-workers look at each other. She is far, far out of
              their league.
 
              INT. DOROTHY'S CAR -- LATER MORNING -- DRIVING
 
              Dorothy Boyd speeds Jerry to the airport, the electricity
              fills the car. On the radio, a sports station debates the
              future of Cushman. as Jerry whips through a stack of sports
              pages.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Avery'll meet you at the B gate at
                        4:15.  Don't be late. Tidwell will
                        already be there.
 
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (nods to Ray)
                        Hey, man, you know they have big
                        balloons built into cars?
 
                                  RAY
                        No.
 
                                  JERRY
                        They do, my brother.
 
                                  RAY
                               (giggling)
                        I'm not your brother!
 
              Dorothy continues, business on her mind.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        ... I put Tidwell on the same
                        floor at the Marriott Marquis.  I
                        think it's great you're taking him
                        to the draft. He doesn't smoke,
                        right? I have no idea.


                                                                     52.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        I have no idea.
                               (continuing to Ray)
                        So Ray, if there's an accident or
                        something, it goes pwoooooooof --
                               (simulates air-bag)
                        -- and you go booooong.  And
                        you're safe.
 
              Jerry bounces against the imaginary balloon.  Ray is
              delighted by Jerry.   Dorothy notes that he's great with her
              son.  She pats Jerry on the shoulder.  Her hand lingers
              perhaps a millisecond too long.  She pulls away quickly,
              always feeling on the edge or embarrassing herself around
              this guy.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Okay, have we gone over
                        everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Yep.  Have a good time at school,
                        Ray.  Wish me luck.
 
                           DOROTHY                       RAY
                   Luck.                         LUCK!
 
              Jerry nods and exits.  They watch as Jerry inches into the
              crowded airport.  Into frame, obscuring their view of Jerry,
              enters another Couple, who embrace each other and their small
              girl.   It's a genuinely sweet goodbye, and we linger on
              Dorothy and Ray who both watch with private fantasies of the
              goodbye they didn't get. Mother and son look at each other,
              communicating volumes. They pull back into traffic.
 
              INT. DALLAS AIRPORT -- DAY
 
              Jerry struggles through the Dallas airport, is the last, of
              his party to arrive at the B gate in Dallas.  Avery, tall and
              cool in plaid skirt and shades, is in combat mode.   Nearby,
              Cush is surrounded by fans and fawning Airline Employees.
              ("Where do you think you're gonna end up, Cush?"  "You gonna
              be rich, dude!") Tidwell looks jealous and ingnored as he
              leans against the airline counter, unnoticed.  A lone kid
              approaches Tidwell.
 
                                  KID
                        Are you Hootie?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (irritated)
                        No man, I'm not Hootie.
 
              Kid leaves disappointed. Tidwell sinks lower. Doesn't anyone
              know his stardom, his essence, his power?


                                                                     53.
 
 
                                  BOARDING ANNOUNCEMENT
                        All those disabled, and Frank
                        Cushman can board now...
 
              INT. AIRPLANE -- DAY
 
              Jerry sits next to Cushman, who is reading Bukowski's Notes
              of a Dirty Old Man.  Across the aisle is Tidwell, who sits
              next to Avery.  They are a small family, and Jerry feels at
              home with his operation.  Cush looks up suddenly.
 
                                  CUSH
                               (a big thought)
                        Jerry.  Why does God sometimes
                        reward the evil and punish the
                        good?
 
              Jerry shares a look with Avery, who is on the other side of
              Cush. Her stockings swish as she crosses her legs.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Let me think about that.  Want
                        something to drink?
 
                                  CUSH
                               (thoughtful pause)
                        I see what you're saying.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Wait.  What do you mean?
 
              The two men have now totally confused each other. Tidwell
              leans across the aisle to Cush, attempting comraderie.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Hey man, I wish I had a
                        quarterback like you in Arizona.
                        You're the shit.
 
              Cush looks up.  Compliments blow off him like a summer breeze.
 
                                  CUSH
                        Thank ya.
 
              Tidwell waits for a compliment of his own, but Cush doesn't
              offer one.  He returns to the book.  Tidwell feels slighted.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (loud mumble)
                        Well you ain't that mothafuckin
                        good.
 
                                  CUSH
                        Say what?


                                                                     54.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I said -- last I heard, Jesus
                        Christ was still in heaven.  And
                        you ain't even played in the NFL.
 
              Cush throws his book away, ready for anything, as Tidwell
              rises. Nearby passengers begin to panic.
 
                                  JERRY
                        This can't be happening to me.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Jerry!  Do something --
 
              Jerry throws himself in front of Cushman.
 
                                  JERRY
                        HEY.  Knock it off.  What are you,
                        five years old?  Am I taking the
                        kids to Chuck E. Cheese here? Grow
                        up, both of you!  We are a family.
                        And we go to the draft in an
                        ORDERLY FASHION.
 
              Beat. Jerry wonders if he's pushed his mealtickets around too
              much.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Hey, man, I dig Check E. Cheese.
 
                                  CUSH
                        Me too, dude.  Especially that big
                        old singin' Elvis Monkey.  That's
                        just insanity, man.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Heard that.
 
              Tidwell reaches over, he and Cush exchange a fingertips five.
              Briefly, the two clients bond. Past Tidwell, Avery smiles
              engagingly at Jerry.  He handled the situation well.  She
              crosses her legs, stockings swishing.  The workplace excites
              her.
 
              EXT. MARRIOTT MARQUIS -- NIGHT
 
              The headquarters for the NFL draft is buzzing with activity.
              Limo doors open and out pours Maguire and company.  Media
              lights flick on, bathing Cush.  Reporters chatter. ("Is it
              San Diego or Denver, Cush?N  "Cush!")  Fans at the outskirts
              are calling out to the young star ("Go get the big chi-ching,
              Cush!") Avery smoothly pulls ESPN into the front position.
              Telegenic Cush shrugs and smiles. ("I'll either surf or
              ski.")  Jerry admires his fiancee.  There is nothing more
              attractive than a person burningly efficient at their job.


                                                                     55.
 
 
              Shot drifts off this media bubble to find Tidwell watching at
              the outskirts.  He turns and exits unnoticed.
 
              INT. GIFT SHOP -- NIGHT -- LATER
 
              Tidwell hides out in the gift shop, thumbing through
              magazines. The chip on his shoulder grows by the minute.
              Elsewhere in the gift shop, he sees the very real and
              emotional scene of a young athlete and his mother.  Both wear
              self-promoting colorful homemade t-shirts with the young
              athlete's face on it.  Something about them, their pure
              enthusiasm, rubs Tidwell in an odd way.  He almost cries, for
              himself, for humanity, as Jerry enters.  Tidwell is
              embarrassed to have been caught in this misty state.
 
                                  JERRY
                        At last I find you.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (sharply)
                        Why the fuck am I here?  I feel
                        like I'm five years late for the
                        Prom.
 
              In a look, Jerry sizes up the situation.  With a hand on
              Tidwell's large shoulder, he smoothly pumps up the big man's
              ego.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Come on.  Come with me.  We're
                        going to take a walk through this
                        lobby. I want every media guy,
                        every player rep, everybody to see
                        you for what you are.  The best-
                        kept secret in the NFL. The
                        biggest wide-receiver in the game.
                        Let 'em see ya, Rod.  And Whatever
                        you do, don't sit down. Let 'em
                        see how big you are.  You ready?
                        Let's do it.
 
              He is privately thrilled, but offers only:
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (begrudgingly)
                        A'right.  Let's walk.
 
              We hear the ripping guitar explosion of The Who's "Magic Bus"
              from Live at Leeds.


                                                                     56.
 
 
              INT. MARRIOTT LOBBY -- NIGHT
 
              Maguire and Tidwell move through the brightly-lit lobby, past
              the reporters, the competing agents, the team
              representatives, the already blasted Jets fans, past even a
              Nike crew filming an NFL spot in the lobby.  Portable phones
              everywhere, in every hand.
 
              There is a heavy white media light bathing everything -- as
              if life had become a t.v. show, and everything within it
              concerned making other t.v. shows.  Jerry works hard,
              introduces Tidwell around. And Tidwell is natural, polite and
              charming, as they move through the pre-draft crowd.  He does
              not sit down.  Music continues.
 
              INT. MARRIOTT BAR -- DAY
 
              Tough red-headed beat reporter PATRICIA LOGAN watches Maguire
              and Tidwell from the opposite corner.
 
                                  PATRICIA
                        Dennis, try not to laugh.  Jerry
                        Maguire brought Rod Tidwell to the
                        draft...
 
              INT. ARIZONA CARDINALS WAR ROOM PHOENIX) -- NIGHT
 
              Arizona General Manager DENNIS WILBURN, 48, is on the phone
              here in the command center for the Arizona Cardinals.  All
              around him, we see the boards and graphs for their upcoming
              draft selections.
 
                                  WILBURN
                        Good, I hope he unloads him so I
                        can buy a decent quarterback.
                        Who's he talking to?
 
                                  PATRICIA
                        Right now, Dallas.  Ha ha.
 
                                  WILBURN
                        They don't look interested do they?
 
                                  PATRICIA
                        Actually...
 
              Wilburn looks concerned.
 
              INT. MARRIOTT ESCALATOR -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry and Tidwell rise triumphantly to the mezzanine level
              above the bright-white lobby.  Maguire looks down at the
              scene.  He breathes in the commotion.  In another twelve
              hours, he will be at the very epicenter with Cushman.


                                                                     57.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I came all the way here for that?
                        To walk the lobby?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Yeah.  And it might have even
                        worked too.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Let's do it again.
 
              Jerry doesn't respond.  Down in the lobby, Jerry catches a
              glimpse of a familiar-looking agent.  It's Sugar. Jerry is
              consumed with a thousand other thoughts, but Tidwell
              continues talking.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (continuing)
                        You believe they're shooting a
                        Nike ad down there?  Did I ever
                        tell you my Nike story?
 
                                  JERRY
                        I gotta get back to Cushman.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Okay, I understand.  I'll boil it
                        down for ya.  Fuck Nike.  All they
                        do is ignore me...
 
              Jerry turns to Tidwell, finally focusing totally on him.
 
                                  JERRY
                        You know what was great about you
                        down there?  For about five
                        minutes, you unloaded that rather
                        expansive, let me just say "large"
                        chip that resides right there on
                        your shoulder, and you know what?
                        You were brilliant.  Take care.
 
              Jerry starts to exit.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        You're loving me now, aren't ya?
 
                                  JERRY
                               (mock serious)
                        I'm not about love -- I'm about
                        "showing you the money."
 
              Tidwell nods deeply, respectfully.


                                                                     58.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Good.  I was just testing ya.
                               (beat)
                        But just you saying that? Makes me
                        love ya.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Get some sleep.  See you tomorrow.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Sure you don't want to go out and
                        find some karoake?  I'm a very
                        good singer, man --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Call me tomorrow.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I might call you later!
 
              Tidwell moves off, still feeling good about the walk.  A
              small pack of diehard Jets fans pass, looking for autographs.
 
              INT. CUSH'S SUITE -- NIGHT
 
              We glide into Frank Cushman's suite overlooking Times Square.
              It's filled with NFL swag -- free t-shirts, athletic bags,
              sweatpants, and more.  Half-finished room service food
              abounds.  Matt, Keith and Cush's stylish college girlfriend
              ANNE-LOUISE mill about the room, basking in the glow of the
              man of the moment.  Cush, who holds a guitar in his lap,
              wears the odd combination of a Nirvana t-shirt and a NFL
              jacket.  He signs for more room service and continues
              strumming the only song he knows on guitar, Cobain's
              "Something In The Way."  Jerry enters on a rush of adrenalin.
 
                                  CUSH
                               (to hotel waiter)
                        Hey, what size are you?
 
                                  WAITER
                        Eleven.
 
                                  CUSH
                               (grandly)
                        Why don't you grab a couple pairs
                        of them new Nikes by the door --
 
              Waiter spots a very tall stack of new Nikes by the door.
 
                                  WAITER
                        Dude, you're like a God.


                                                                     59.
 
 
                                  CUSH
                               (immediately)
                        God, you're like a dude.
 
              It's a great line, and the room breaks up.  This is charisma,
              the future of the NFL.  Waiter exits, as Cush continues
              strumming. And now Jerry speaks, importantly.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Cush, Matt -- we have a decision
                        to make.
 
                                  CUSH
                        "It's okay to eat fish, 'cause
                        they Don't have any feelings...
 
                                  JERRY
                        Okay. San Diego just came in with
                        a last-minute scenario.  It's big.
 
                                  CUSH
                        "Something in the way.  Yeah."
 
                                  MATT
                        Well, he's gotta go number one.
 
                                  CUSH
                        "Ooooooo."
 
                                  JERRY
                        He still goes number one, but San
                        Diego wants to trade up with New
                        England -- they want him bad.
 
              Cush turns to his curiously ambivalent father, who walks to
              the window and looks out at the big Jumbotron with Keith.
 
                                  MATT
                        What happened to Denver?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Denver got very silent about a day
                        ago.  San Diego's got a fever for
                        Cush.  This stuff tends to happen
                        the night before a draft.  People
                        get crazy.  And San Diego, you
                        should know, is crazy to the tune
                        of seven years for thirty. Signing

              Anne-Louise whistles loudly.  She is instantly embarrassed,
              and puts a hand up.  Sorry.  In the next room, the phone is
              ringing.


                                                                     60.
 
 
                                  MATT
                        I don't know, Jerry.
 
                                  KEITH
                        Should I unplug the phone?
 
                                  CUSH
                        Reporters, Jerry.  They been
                        callin' all night.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Just be friendly and say "no
                        comment."
 
                                  CUSH
                        Talking and saying nothing, man,
                        it's an art I have not mastered.
 
              Jerry holds up a finger -- watch me.  Jerry picks up the
              ringing phone. He offers a near-perfect imitation.
 
                                  JERRY
                        "This is Cush."
 
              Suddenly, everyone is, laughing.  The room lightens.
 
              INT. BOB SUGAR'S HOTEL ROOM -- DAY
 
              Bob Sugar talks on his hotel phone.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        It's Sugar.  He must be there,
                        right? Just sniff or something if
                        he's there.
                               (Jerry sniffs,
                                panicked)
                        Alright, buddydude.  Just
                        remember. You're swimming with the
                        big boys now. You let your dad do
                        all the talking.  I'm the one who
                        got you the deal you needed.  This
                        is business not friendship. Be
                        strong.  You're global now.
 
              Sugar hangs up.
 
                                  JERRY
                        "No comment.
 
              Jerry hangs up.  The room is still laughing.  His head is
              spinning.
 
                                  KEITH
                        Hey, it's Cush on the big t.v.
                        again!


                                                                     61.
 
 
                                  CUSH
                        Hell, I'm already sick of me. I
                        got "Cushlash."
 
              More laughs. Jerry sits across from Matt, reeling quietly. He
              speaks casually, directly.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Look, before I go back to Denver.
                        I think we should put something
                        down on paper.  Something that
                        says, "hey, I'm with Jerry
                        Maguire."
 
              He pulls out a yellow legal tablet.  He scribbles a few
              lines, as Matt looks increasingly nervous.
 
                                  MATT
                        Not right now, Jerry.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Do I know everything there is to
                        know here?
                               (silent beat)
                        You fellas aren't talking with Bob
                        Sugar, are you?
 
              More silence.
 
                                  MATT
                        Apparently, Denver wanted to deal
                        with him instead of you.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (quickly)
                        Said who?  Sugar?
 
                                  MATT
                        Hey, I'm learning as I go.
 
                                  JERRY
                        So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal
                        with Denver behind my back?
 
                                  MATT
                        I'm sorry, I --
 
                                  JERRY
                        I brought Denver to twenty
                        million. Denver deals with me all
                        the time. You listened to Sugar?
                        You let that snake in the door.
 
              Jerry touches the coffee table.  Calms himself.


                                                                     62.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        It's okay.  You want Denver. I'll
                        fix this up.  You didn't sign
                        anything with Sugar, right?
 
              Another rough silence is broken by little brother Keith.
 
                                  KEITH
                               (blurts)
                        Mr. Maguire, someday I'm gonna be
                        a famous athlete and I'm gonna
                        sign with you'.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Shut up!
                               (beat)
                        I'm sorry... sorry.
 
                                  KEITH
                               (sympathy for Jerry)
                        S' cool.
 
              Shot moves in on Jerry.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Now.  Wait.  You didn't actually
                        sign with Sugar, did you? Tell me
                        you didn't sign.
                               (beat)
                        Because I'm still sort of moved by
                        your "my word is stronger'n oak"
                        thing --
 
                                  MATT
                        We signed an hour ago.  You were
                        in the lobby with the black fella.
 
              Jerry moans. Silently, he rises and begins to gather his
              things. Cush hangs on to his guitar.
 
                                  CUSH
                        I'm sorry, Jerry.
 
                                  MATT
                        They say it's show "business,"
                        Jerry, not show friends.
 
              Jerry takes a breath before he exits. He surveys the room,
              settling on Cush.  Visible behind Maguire is Times Square, in
              all it's neon logo glory.


                                                                     63.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well. Okay. Of course. You're
                        twenty years old, and I'm just
                        another guy in a suit.  It's all
                        business. It didn't work out.  You
                        didn't buy my product, which is,
                        unfortunately, mm. Let me see,
                        there's a speech that I'm supposed
                        to make -- right! -- "I'll be out
                        there cheering for you." "The door
                        is always open!"  See? I'm a class
                        act.
                               (breath, directly)
                        But maybe this would have all
                        worked, us being real human
                        beings, coming through for each
                        other, really, and now I'll never
                        know. You'll never know. Weren't
                        you curious?
                               (they aren't)
                        No.  Okay, well, I'll be fine.
                        And you'll be fine.  And Keith I
                        bope you do call me.
 
              Flushed and embarrassed, he exits.  We hang a beat on the
              silent Cushman hotel livingroom, as Cush now continues on
              guitar.
 
              INT. LOBBY -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry exits elevator dazed, at full trot.  The Marriott lobby
              is packed.  He is looking for Avery.  Beat reporter Patricia
              Logan reappears.  She relishes asking brutal questions,
              innocently.
 
                                  PATRICIA LOGAN
                        Jerry, is it true that Tidwell's
                        had three concussions?
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'm sorry... excuse me...
 
              INT. BALLROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry enters the grand ballroom, looking for Avery.
              Endorsement placards in evidence everywhere.  NFL reps and
              media workers move tables and work out camera and seating
              arrangements.  Elevated in a open ESPN booth six feet off the
              ground, host Chris Berman records voice-overs for tomorrow's
              draft.  Fans heckle him by singing the ESPN theme.  He rolls
              with it, expertly.  Jerry spots Avery across the empty
              ballroom, moving fast, passing out media packets on the empty
              tables.


                                                                     64.
 
 
              INT. ADJACENT BUFFET ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry finally catches up with Avery in the empty side-room.
 
                                  AVERY
                        I just heard.
 
                                  JERRY
                        What do I do?  How do I spin this?
 
                                  AVERY
                        Oh honey.  It's spun.
 
              She keeps moving, adding an extra snap to the packets.
 
                                  JERRY
                        What did I do to you?
 
              She is furious with his question.  Doesn't he know?
 
                                  AVERY
                        It's all about you, isn't it?
                        Soothe me, save me, love me --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Could you just stop moving?
 
                                  AVERY
                        I have to finish my job --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Everything's on the fucking run!
                        Everything --
 
              She stops.  Walks to him, framed by a bank of t.v. monitors.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Jerry.  You and I are salespeople.
                        We sell --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Look, I don't want a --
 
                                  AVERY
                        It's not "love me."  It's not
                        "trust my handshake."  It's make
                        the sale. Get it signed.  There
                        shouldn't be "confusion" about
                        that.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Go ahead.  Jump right on into my
                        nightmare.  The water's warm.


                                                                     65.
 
 
                                  AVERY
                        So honesty is outlawed here, I
                        can't be honest?
 
              She turns and exits again.  He follows.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Tell you what -- I'd prefer
                        loyalty..
 
                                  AVERY
                        What was our deal when we first
                        got together?  Brutal truth,
                        remember?
 
                                  JERRY
                        I think you added the "brutal."
 
              She stops, slaps down another media packet.  Blows a
              troublesome piece of hair out of her face.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Jerry, there is a "sensitivity"
                        thing that some people have.  I
                        don't have it.  I don't cry at
                        movies.  I don't gush over babies.
                        I don't start celebrating
                        Christmas five months early, and
                        I don't tell a man who just
                        screwed up both of our lives --
                        'oh, poor baby.'  That's me.  For
                        better or worse.  But I do love
                        you.
 
              Jerry looks at his fiancee.  Standing here, watching Avery
              coldly clasping her media packs to her chest, she looks
              different to him.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Avery --
 
              She knows what's coming.  She moves fast to avoid him.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Don't say it.  We're both ragged
                        out right now.
 
                                  JERRY
                        -- stop --
 
              She exits back into the main ballroom.  For a moment, she
              stops. They face off.  This is it.  They are quickly
              interrupted by overweight, talk-show voiced CURTIS WEINTRAUB,
              45.


                                                                     66.
 
 
                                  CURTIS WEINTRAUB
                        Hey!  Curtis Weintraub from the
                        Sports Popper!  Haven't seen you
                        two since the Cuervo Gold Rock 'n
                        Sock Charity Six Flags Budfest!
                        Hello!
 
              Neither look at him, they remain fixed on each other.  Curtis
              gets a whiff of what he walked into.
 
                                  CURTIS WEINTRAUB
                               (continuing; exiting
                                quickly)
                        Goodbye!
 
                                  AVERY
                        I'm warning you.  Don't say it.
                        You won't have another chance.
 
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Listen to me!
 
                                  AVERY
                        No.
 
                                  JERRY
                        It's over --
 
              She continues moving into the next room.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Didn't hear it.
 
                                  JERRY
                        There is something missing here.
 
                                  AVERY
                        You've never been alone and you
                        can't be alone --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Listen to me, it's over.
 
              She can barely believe it.  She blinks.
 
                                  AVERY
                        No one has ever dumped me.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'm not trying to make history.


                                                                     67.
 
 
                                  AVERY
                        I did the 23 hour nose-route to
                        the top of El Capitan in 6 hours!
                        I can make this work.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (it slips out)
                        No.
 
              She takes a breath.  It sinks in.  From somewhere, the small
              voice of her vulnerability.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Oh Jerry.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (steps closer)
                        You know I didn't ever want to
                        hurt you.
 
              She gets an odd look, shaking her head.  Starts to step away,
              then thinks better of it.  She WALLOPS him in the face with
              the back of her hand.  Jerry stands like a woozy boxer. She
              hits him again with a fist, then again in the chest.  He
              sinks to the floor, sagging. backwards.  She straddles him,
              addresses him fully, right in his bruised face.
 
                                  AVERY
                        I won't let you hurt me, Jerry.
                        I'm too strong for you.  Loser.
 
              INT. JFK AIRPORT -- NEXT MORNING
 
              Jerry moves through the crowded airport with Rod Tidwell.
              Both wear sunglasses.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        You love me now, don't you?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Very much.
 
              ON TV MONITOR -- ROY FIRESTONE
 
              is leaning forward, expressively, talking with a weepy
              athlete.
 
              INT. RED CARPET LOUNGE -- DAY
 
              Tidwell watches next to Jerry, as they wait for the flight.
              Jerry nurses a stiff drink.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Everybody on this show cries now.


                                                                     68.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Rod --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (off t.v. )
                        You feel bad you tested positive?
                        Quit doing blow!  You feel bad
                        about your baby girl? Why did you
                        leave the mother?
 
                                  JERRY
                        What are you doing with me, Rod?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Huh?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Don't you even see -- I'm
                        finished. I'm fucked. Twenty-four
                        hours ago, I was hot. Now... I'm
                        a cautionary tale!
 
              Tidwell looks at Jerry, impassive.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        See this jacket I'm wearing?  You
                        like it?  I don't really need it,
                        because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE.
                        I lost the number one draft pick
                        the night before the draft. They
                        will teach my story to other
                        agents on "do not do this" day in
                        agent school. Why? Let's recap.
                        Because a hockey player's kid made
                        me feel like a superficial jerk,
                        I had two slices of bad pizza,
                        went to bed, grew a conscience and
                        wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom!
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
 
                                  JERRY
                        The least you could do is nod and
                        act sympathetic --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (shaking head)
                        No.
 
                                  JERRY
                        It's a quality that might come in
                        handy for a commercial sometime.


                                                                     69.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        You are not allowed to act this
                        way.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Why not?
 
              INT. AIRPLANE -- LATER DAY
 
              They sit together. Jerry holds another drink.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Man, I got a shelf life of ten
                        years, tops!  My next contract's
                        gotta bring me the dollars that'11
                        last me and mine a very long time.
                        I'm out of this sport in five
                        years.  What's my family gonna
                        live on? What you get me.  So I
                        don't want to hear about ya shit,
                        your "nya nya nya."
 
                                  JERRY
                               (ruefully, to
                                attendant)
                        Another drink please.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Anybody else would have left you
                        by now, but I'm sticking with you.
                        I said I would. And if I got to
                        ride your ass like Zorro, you're
                        gonna show me the money.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (the hell that never
                                ends)
                        Oh my God.
 
              He looks straight ahead, at the airphone in front of him.
 
              EXT. PORCH -- NIGHT
 
              Dorothy finds Laurel on their small porch.  There is only
              room for a miniature garden and one comfortable seat. Laurel
              sits in it.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        He's coming over.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        At eleven at night?


                                                                     70.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        He just lost his best client.  He
                        called from the plane.  I invited
                        the guy over.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This
                        is a "syndrome."  It's called
                        Early Midlife, About-To-Marry,
                        Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear-
                        God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll-
                        Call-My-Newly Long-suffering-
                        Assistant-Without Medical-For-
                        Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing
                        all that, you still allow him to
                        come over, more power to you.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Honey, he's engaged.  And for the
                        first time in my professional
                        life, I'm a part of something I
                        believe in.
 
              Dorothy exits.  Laurel shakes her head, calls to next room.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Okay, but he better not be good
                        looking!
 
              INT. RAY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Dorothy puts Ray to bed.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        'Night buddy.  This is my favorite
                        part of your head.
 
              She kisses the corner of his forehead, rising up into the
              mirror.
 
              She checks her look, in spite of herself. Visible on the wall
              above Ray's bed, is her ex-husband's photo. Music.
 
              INT. CAB -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry in back of a cab, wearing sunglasses, three drinks
              later, post-flight, rolling with anything.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Okay, turn here!  Sharp right
                        turn. 8831 3/4 Waterloo.
 
              The cab turns onto a very small street.  Cars parked on both
              sides. Down the street, another pair of headlights.


                                                                     71.
 
 
              Jerry's cab refuses to give in, in fact he floors it.  Same
              with the oncoming car.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Yes, good, floor it, kill us!!
 
              EXT. DOROTHY'S FRONT PORCH -- NIGHT
 
              Door opens to reveal Jerry Maguire with brown bag, shoulder
              hang-up bag, disheveled hair and sunglasses.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'm Jerry Maguire.
 
                                  LAUREL
                               (super pleasant)
                        You seem just the way I pictured
                        you. I'm her disapproving sister
                        Laurel.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Honesty.  Thank you.
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM
 
              Jerry enters, as Dorothy rounds the corner.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Hey you.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Hi.
 
              The lights are low and his glasses are very dark.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Thanks for inviting me over.
                        Where's the little guy?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        He's asleep.  Watch out for that
                        lamp.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'm glad you're home.  That
                        "alone" thing is... not my
                        specialty...
 
              He ducks the lamp, barely. Laurel exits through his shot,
              miming "drinking" behind his back. Jerry takes off his
              glasses, revealing a welt and a cut below his eye.


                                                                     72.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Oh my God.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Yeah.  That too.  I broke up with
                        Avery.
 
              Dorothy's entire body chemistry changes in ways she doesn't
              quite understand.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Too bad.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Better now than later.  We'll
                        still be friends. I'm dying here.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
 
                                  JERRY
                        And just think if I got her the
                        ring she really wanted.
 
              Dorothy laughs.  He looks at her strangely.  Suddenly she
              feels very nervous, as he sets down his bags.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Sorry.  Uh, let me see, have a
                        seat. I'll get you some aloe vera
                        for that cut too.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Do you have something to drink?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Sure --
 
              She moves to the kitchen door.  She is about to exit, when
              Jerry begins to unburden.
 
                                  JERRY
                        My brother works for the White
                        House. He pretends he's an
                        intellectual.  He pretends he's
                        from the east coast.
 
              She turns, not quite sure what his point is.  She waits
              politely for Jerry to finish before exiting into the kitchen.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        I was supposed to be the
                        successful one.
                                  (more)


                                                                     73.
 
 
                                  JERRY (cont'd)
                        But I don't want to talk about it.
                        And yet!  My family.  I grew up
                        with repression as a... a
                        religion --you don't bitch.  No
                        moaning!  Head down.  Do it,
                        whatever "it" may be. My dad... he
                        worked for the United Way for 38
                        years!  You know what he said when
                        he retired? He said, "I wish I'd
                        had a more comfortable chair." 38
                        years he sat in it!  Do you know
                        what I'm saying, Dorothy?
                        Repression as a religion. I'm
                        almost as old as his chair.
 
              He rubs his face.  She looks at him, and the situation
              slightly overwhems her. Here he is, wide-open, ripe for the
              taking.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Beer okay?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Yeah, thanks.
 
              INT. KITCHEN
 
              Laurel smokes a cigarette and blows it out the window.
              Dorothy goes for the refrigerator, finds a couple beers.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        I heard.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        No kidding.  I looked over and saw
                        the shadow of two curious shoes in
                        the doorway of the kitchen.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        This guy would go home with a
                        gardening tool right now if it
                        showed interest.
                               (off Dorothy's look)
                        Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (surprised)
                        Thank you.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Look, here's some of that chicken
                        with salsa too, I warmed it up --


                                                                     74.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        That's the girl I love.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        But you just gotta hear me out on
                        one thing.  You're very
                        responsible with Ray and you know
                        it's not right for a little boy to
                        hear some strange man's voice in
                        the house.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        As opposed to twenty angry women?
 
              Dorothy turns quickly and the beer, sisters and chicken
              collide in the small kitchen.  Dorothy deftly catches the
              food in her t-shirt, and dumps it back onto the plate.  But
              her shirt is now stained. She starts to quietly implode, and
              Laurel takes command.  They know each other well.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Come on, let's get you another
                        top --
 
              They exit to nearby laundry room.
 
              EXT. HOUSE/WINDOW OUTSIDE LAUNDRY ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Now camera starts to move around the house, from this window
              showing the two sisters in the laundry room, to the living
              room where Jerry sits alone.  We see Ray wander into the room
              and stare at Jerry.
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry, who is playing with a kaleidoscope on the table, looks
              up to see Ray.
 
                                  RAY
                        Hi.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Hi Ray.
 
              INT. LAUNDRY ROOM -- SAME TIME
 
                                  LAUREL
                        All I'm saying.  You don't have
                        the luxury of falling for some
                        drowning man.  Be practical.  Now.
                        Which top?
 
              She holds up two tops.  One is sexier with a dipped down
              front. The other is striped, cute, functional.


                                                                     75.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Okay, you want to talk about
                        practical? Let's talk about my
                        wonderful life. Do you know what
                        most other women my age are doing
                        right now? They are partying in
                        clubs, trying to act stupid,
                        trying to get a man, trying to
                        keep a man... not me. I'm trying
                        to RAISE a man.
 
              She grabs the sexier top, and puts it on.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        I've got a 24 hour a day reminder
                        of Roger, for the rest of my life.
                        I have had three lovers in four
                        years, all boring, all achingly
                        self-sufficient all friends of
                        yours I might add, and all of them
                        running a distant second to a warm
                        bath.  Look at me, Laurel, look at
                        me.  I'm the oldest 26 year old in
                        the world!  How do I look?
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Good.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Thanks.
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry and Ray have a great conversation, playing tug with a
              piece of rope.
 
                                  RAY
                        And then my dad died and my mom
                        took me to the zoo and I love the
                        zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you
                        love the zoo?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Wait.  I want to tell you more
                        about my dad.
 
                                  RAY
                        Let's go the zoo.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Okay.  I've been hogging it.
                        You're right.
                                  (more)


                                                                     76.
 
 
                                  JERRY (cont'd)
                        All my life I've been trying to
                        talk, really talk, and no one
                        wants to listen.  You know that
                        feeling?
 
              Ray nods vigorously.
 
                                  RAY
                        Let's go right now.  Let's go to
                        the zoo.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Aw, the fucking thing... I mean,
                        the zoo is closed.
 
                                  RAY
                        You said "fuck".
 
                                  JERRY
                        Yeah I know.  I did.
 
              Ray loves this guy.  He pats Jerry's knee.
 
                                  RAY
                        I won't tell.
 
                                  JERRY
                        We'll go to the zoo sometime.
                        Okay? I think I might have some
                        time on my hands.
 
              Ray looks at Jerry's hands.
 
                                  RAY
                        I don't see any.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (points respectfully)
                        Funny.
 
                                  RAY
                        Funny...
                               (imitates him)
                               (hears mom
                                approaching)
                        I better go to bed.
 
              Ray hugs Jerry and exits.  Jerry sits contemplating the kid
              for a moment.  The door swings open and a harried Dorothy
              appears in the sexier top, but with a distinctly less sexy
              attitude, and a tray.


                                                                     77.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Drinks.  Food.  Plus, I called you
                        a cab.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (slightly confused)
                        Good idea.  Thank you.
 
              And we should keep our voices down a little.  I have a little
              boy asleep.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Right.  Of course.
 
              Jerry tries to twist open the beer, ripping at his palm. It's
              not a twist-off.  She hands him an opener.  He opens it,
              inelegantly.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        So.  Our company.
 
              She watches the drunken man, who drinks. Then coughs a
              little. Then stands.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Okay.  Lil' speech before I go.
 
              He gets up, woozy, but loose.  Powerfully:
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Do.  Not.  Worry.  About.  Your.
                        Job.
                               (beat)
                        Our company is in good shape. You
                        and your son... we... are just
                        fine.  You still have a job. I
                        want you to feel confident!  In.
                        Me.  And I have a problem with
                        people who talk about themselves
                        in the third person, but let me
                        tell you something about Jerry
                        Maguire.
 
              His confidence nicely fueled, Jerry reaches for a fireplace
              poker. He begins to joust with an imaginary opponent.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Come after me and you will lose I
                        am a survivor!  Do not
                        underestimate Jerry Maguire!  I've
                        got wits!
                                  (more)


                                                                     78.
 
 
                                  JERRY (cont'd)
                        I've got the instincts of a
                        panther!
                               (joust)
                        I've got Dorothy Boyd on my side!
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Don't worry about me.  I can get
                        jobs --
 
                                  JERRY
                        We will be fine!
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        -- especially one like this.
 
                                  JERRY
                        And I am...
 
              He becomes very aware of himself. Acting out in a virtual
              stranger's small-but-comfortable living room.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        I am drunk.
 
              He collapses onto the sofa, embarrassed.  Shaking his head.
              Dorothy scoots closer in an adjacent chair.  She breaks the
              personal barrier, carefully touching his wound with the wet
              tip of the aloe vera plant.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Truth?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Sure.
 
              Dorothy turns to see that Laurel's two shoes are still very
              visible at the kitchen door.  Decides to ignore them.  She
              gets closer.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Sure, I care about the job.  Of
                        course.  But mostly...
                               (very honest)
                        ...  I want to be inspired.
 
              There is something inspiring about the way she says the word
              "inspiring."
 
                                  JERRY
                        Me too.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        What you wrote inspired me.


                                                                     79.
 
 
              He is catching a scent of that most ancient elixer.  A
              woman's affection.  Their heads inch closer together.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        I'm working with you because of
                        that memo...
 
                                  JERRY
                        Mission... statement...
 
              They kiss.  It turns rather passionate.  She places a cool
              hand on his cheek.   He places a hand on her breast.  The
              taxi beeps outside.  She pulls away.  Both regard the hand on
              her breast.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Well.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Sorry about this hand.
                               (he rises unsteadily)
                        You know that feeling -- you're
                        not completely embarrassed yet,
                        but you glimpe tomorrow's
                        embarrassment?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Don't worry about it, boss.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Oh shit.  You said "boss."
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Yeah, I did.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        No.  No don't feel like Clarence
                        Thomas.
 
                                  JERRY
                        No, I do.  I feel like Clarence
                        Thomas.
                               (the worst day ever)
                        I'm like... harrassing you...
                        right now.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I may not sue.
 
              He laughs a little.  Music.  Unsure what more to say, Jerry
              rubs his face.  And then:


                                                                     80.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, good evening.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Good evening.
 
              He stands, returns the fireplace poker to her, and exits.
              Stumbling slightly on the first step leading down from the
              front porch, he recovers with style.
 
                                  JERRY
                        We'll be okay.  And I'm going to
                        take my... one client and we're
                        gonna go all the way.
 
              He takes a few more steps, re-balancing bags, coughs a
              little.  He is a mess, and he knows it.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing; loving
                                the dark humor)
                        Hey. I'm back.
 
              She laughs, waves, and exits back into the kitchen.  She
              regards the poker still in her hand. Laurel watches her
              conflicted, slightly lovesick sister.
 
              INT. CAB -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry in the back of the cab.  He turns for a moment, looking
              back at the warm house he's just left. Something is
              scratching at his soul, trying to get in. Music continues. He
              was strangely comfortable there, as the house disappears from
              his view.
 
                                                       FADE TO
 
              EXT. TEMPE PRACTICE AREA -- DAY
 
              Rod Tidwell races to catch up to a wobbly, overthrown pass.
              He snags it out of the air, and moves gracefully downfield.
              He turns back to shout at the quarterback for the wobbly
              pass, and slams into a padding post.  Dennis Wilburn, the GM
              we met earlier, crosses in front of Maguire, giving him a
              look.  Maguire forges ahead anyway.
 
                                  JERRY
                        We gotta talk about his contract,
                        Dennis.
 
                                  WILBURN
                        Your timing is impeccable,
                        Maguire. Gee, I can't imagine how
                        you ever lost Cush...


                                                                     81.
 
 
              Wilburn moves on, scoffing loudly.
 
              INT. LOCKER ROOM SHOWER AREA -- DAY
 
              Jerry stands in pre-season locker-room.   Off-stage we hear
              a shower.  In the b.g., one of those locker-room psych-up
              signs like: Injuries happen first in the mind.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I started talking with Dennis
                        Wilburn about your renegotation.
 
              Rod emerges naked, dripping wet, pissed.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Did you tell him about the "ten
                        million for four years?"
 
                                  JERRY
                        Uh, not today, but --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        John Taylor.  J.J. Stokes.  Andre
                        Rison.  I SMOKE all these fools,
                        and yet they're making the big
                        sweet dollars. They're making the
                        money, and I got an agent that
                        ain't even put the number on the
                        table.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I understand your anxiety.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Maybe you don't.  Because it's not
                        just the money I deserve.  It's
                        not just the "coin."  It's the...
 
              He says this next word royally, as if it's fine silk.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (continuing)
                        --  the kwan.
 
                                  JERRY
                        That's your word?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Yeah, man, it means love, respect,
                        community... and the dollars too.
                        The package.  The kwan.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (impressed)
                        But how did you get "kwan?"


                                                                     82.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (irritated)
                        I got there from "coin," dude.
                        Coin, coin... kwaaaan.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Great word.  Towel?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        No, I air-dry.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Rod, I say this with great
                        respect, but those players you
                        mentioned are marquee players
                        and --
 
              A portable phone beeps.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Is that your porty or mine?
 
                                  JERRY
                        You.
 
              Tidwell rummages in his bag.  Finds one of two porties and
              answers the one with a Polaroid of Marcee taped to it.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Hi baby. Yeah, I'm just breakin'
                        in the new agent.  He says I'm not
                        marquee.  I know... I know...
 
              Tidwell holds up the phone so Jerry can hear the sound of
              Marcee going off.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (continuing)
                        My wife is upset with you.
 
              INT. LOCKER ROOM MIRROR -- DAY
 
              The conversation continues as Tidwell fixes hair in the
              mirror. Jerry  speaks  to  the  reflection,  taking  him  on,
              gesturing passionately.  Tidwell, still naked, may or may not
              be listening.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Here's what I'm saying.  This is
                        a renegotiation.  We want more
                        from them, so let's show them more
                        from us. Let's show them your pure
                        joy of the game, let's bury the
                        Attitude a little, let's show
                        them --


                                                                     83.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (irritated)
                        You're telling me to dance.
 
                                  JERRY
                        No, I'm saying to be --
 
              He mimes a dainty little showboat-touchdown dance.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (little voice)
                        "Love me love me love me... put me
                        on t.v."
                               (pissed)
                        That's the iconography of rascism,
                        man!
 
                                  JERRY
                        Rod, I'm not a rascist.  I'm
                        telling you to be the best version
                        of you, to get back to the guy who
                        first started playing this game.
                        Way back when you were a kid.  It
                        wasn't just about the money, was
                        it?
 
              Tidwell gives him a look.  Money was always a factor.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Do your job, man, don't tell me to
                        dance.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Fine.
 
              He begins gathering his things.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I'm an athlete, not an
                        entertainer. These are the ABC's
                        of ME.  Get it? I don't dance.
 
              Jerry rubs face.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (continuing)
                        What's wrong.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Forget it.  Forget it.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        No tell me.


                                                                     84.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'm out here for you!  You don't
                        know what it's like to be me out
                        here for you. It is an up-at-dawn
                        pride-swallowing seige that I will
                        never fully tell you about! Okay?!
                        Help me help you help me help you.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        You're hanging by a very thin
                        thread, dude.  And I dig that
                        about you.
 
              Jerry has had enough for one day.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (loopy, punch-drunk,
                                arms flailing)
                        Hey.  I'm happy to entertain you!
                        I'll see you in L.A.!
 
              Tidwell watches his agent lurch off, muttering and swaying.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        See, man, that's the difference.
                        between us.  You think we're
                        fighting, I think we're finally
                        talking!
 
              INT. LAX AIRPORT -- DAY
 
              Jerry moves slowly through crowded airport, preoccupied with
              thought.
 
              INT. JERRY'S HOME OFFICE -- LATER DAY
 
              Jerry enters, carrying bags, weary.  Dorothy greets him. They
              are stuck in his small condo, and the scent of their previous
              encounter is still in the air.  She hands him a list of his
              calls.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona
                        to say he's faxing in the new
                        Tidwell offer on Thursday morning,
                        and you'll be happy.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (jolted into
                                happiness)
                        Happy. He said "happy?"
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Actually he said "glad."


                                                                     85.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Good.  Good.  Glad is good.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Plus, you could use that
                        commission.
 
              She hands him a financial report she's done.  He takes a
              quick look, seeing the thorough work she's already done.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I sunk most of what I had into
                        this condo, which devalued, and --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        You don't have to explain.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Look, the other night, I want to
                        apologize.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (can't read her)
                        Yeah, what happened there.
 
                                  JERRY
                        We're two people working together
                        and we can't have an atmosphere.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I'm relieved you said that.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I mean, the other night was... I
                        felt like you understood something
                        I could barely even say, something
                        way down deep in the murk --
                               (beat)
                        -- but we have a company here to
                        think about.  I won't ever take
                        advantage of you in that way again.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (evenly)
                        Oh good.
 
                                  JERRY
                        You walked out on a job for me,
                        and I won't ruin that.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Exactly because I know this is a
                        time when you need to be alone
                        with your thoughts.
                                  (more)


                                                                     86.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY (cont'd)
                        Think about everything that's gone
                        wrong, how to fix them, and just
                        be... alone, alone, alone.
 
              Dorothy in the background of the shot, watching his reaction.
 
                                  JERRY
                        You want to go out to dinner?
 
              INT. DOROTHY'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY
 
              Dorothy looks for a jacket as Laurel helms the Divorced
              Women's group in the living room.  Jan speaks through her
              whistly braces, gesturing with a too-full glass of red wine.
 
                                  JAN
                        I broke up with the Cowboy. And
                        now he's stalking me...
 
                                  ALICE
                        What's the current definition of
                        stalking?
 
                                  WOMAN # 1
                        Coming over uninvited.
 
                                  JAN
                               (thoughtful)
                        So Romeo under the trellis... was
                        a stalker.
 
              Meaningful sounds of revelation, as Dorothy finds the jacket.
 
              INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT
 
              Dorothy stops in the hallway to see that Jerry Maguire has
              arrived at the back-kitchen door.  She watches unseen as
              Maguire shakes hands with Chad the Nanny and is hit suddenly
              by a flying hug from Ray.  He gives the kid an athletic bag,
              which is filled with state-of-the-art promotional athletic
              wear, etc. ("Brought you some swag.")  Ray continues hugging
              Jerry.
 
              INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry is a little embarrassed by the affections of the kid.
              Dorothy enters.  Expertly breezy.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Hey, looks like you've got a fan.


                                                                     87.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (outdressed)
                        Wow.  That's more than a dress.
                        That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Yeah -- guess I got revved up at
                        the idea of an evening among
                        adults -- no offense buster.
                               (then)
                        You meet Chad the nanny?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Yeah, I did -- am I dressed okay?
                        I guess I didn't realize we were...
 
              He doesn't finish the words "going out on a date."  The
              cacaphony of the Boyd home swirls around Maguire.  It's a new
              sensation for this bachelor.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Don't let him stay up too late.
 
                                  CHAD
                               (grandly)
                        Hey, man, tonight I'm going to
                        teach Ray about jazz.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Good, that'll put him to sleep
                        early. No offense.
 
              She twirls toward the door, grabbing her purse.
 
                                  CHAD
                        You know, you people have a jazz
                        problem in this house.
 
              Laurel enters, adding to the chaos, adlibbing hellos.
 
                                  RAY
                        I wanna go too.
 
              Laurel gives Ray a look.  Ray backs down, as Jerry hears
              snatches of the Women's group going full blast in the living
              room.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Bye you guys.


                                                                     88.
 
 
              Ray extends his arms, he wants a hug.  Jerry bends down
              awkwardly to give him one, and Ray plants a kiss on Jerry's
              cheek.  All are surprised, especially Jerry.  Dorothy is
              struck and moved.  Shot falls on Ray who watches Jerry exit
              with wonder. Even at his age, he knows a prize when he sees
              one.
 
              INT. KITCHEN-- NIGHT
 
              Laurel looks out the window, watches her sister exiting. She
              is equal parts jealous and protective.  She spots keys on
              counter. She grabs them and runs out to catch her sister on
              the lawn. "All Shook Down."  Replacements.
 
              EXT. DOROTHY'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry and Dorothy exit through the many cars which we now see
              are parked on the street and the front lawn.  The sound of
              the Women's group is heard in the warmly glowing house behind
              them.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Hey!
 
              As Jerry moves ahead to the car, Dorothy retreats so she can
              have privacy with her sister.
 
                                  LAUREL
                               (continuing)
                        Forgot your keys --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (privately)
                        That's the first time I ever saw
                        him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't
                        that just... thrilling?
                               (eyes tear up)
                        I mean, he must have been needing
                        that.
 
              Women's group laughter in the distance as Laurel attempts to
              glue her emotional sister back together.  She holds her arm.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        No no.  Don't cry at the beginning
                        of the date.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (laughing, wiping
                                tear)
                        Oh, knock it off!


                                                                     89.
 
 
                                  LAUREL
                               (can't help it)
                        And don't be a shoulder for him to
                        cry on either.
 
              We stay with Laurel as she watches her sister exit.   Music
              continues.  Lit by streetlight, Dorothy runs like a young
              girl, across the lawns of this car-filled neighborhood,
              slapping away the leaves of a tree, running to Jerry down the
              street.
 
              INT. ANTONIO'S RESTAURANT -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry and Dorothy sit at the table of this Mexican
              restaurant. In the background, Mariachis play.
 
                                  JERRY
                        It was laziness1 my whole breakup
                        with Avery. You know that thing
                        you say, "it's nobody's fault."
                        It's one of the great lies, right?
                        Someone is always to blame -- if
                        you go for it, go for it like you
                        do a job, work at it --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Maybe love shouldn't be such hard
                        work. I know, but --
 
              Mariachis approach the table.
 
                                  HEAD MARIACHI
                        A song for the lovers?
 
                                  JERRY/DOROTHY
                               (too quickly)
                        No.  No thanks.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        We work together.
 
              Jerry slips the guy a few bucks to go away. They do so,
              reluctantly.
 
                                  JERRY
                        See, you choose. If you fall for
                        someone, if you make a commitment,
                        you should make it work.  It's
                        only when "options" entered the
                        picture that things got bad. I'm
                        speaking historically now.  It's
                        a modern day concept,
                        nueroticism -- how do I feeeeeel?
                        -- I think the only good thing to
                                  (more)


                                                                     90.
 
 
                                  JERRY (cont'd)
                        come from this period in history
                        is probably the movie "Annie Hall."
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (evenly)
                        Maybe you should call her.
 
                                  JERRY
                        No no no.  I just underestimated
                        her...
                               (touches wound)
                        her temper, I guess.  Why are we
                        even talking about this?
 
              A FLOWER GIRL approaches the table with an armful of roses.
 
                                  FLOWER GIRL
                        A rose for the lady.
 
                                  JERRY
                        You want a --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        (   (scoffs)
                        No.  No way.
 
              Jerry gives her few bucks, she exits.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        Yeah.  It wasn't like my marriage
                        to Roger was so great, even
                        before --
                               (stops herself)
                        Jerry?
 
                                  JERRY
                        What?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (simply)
                        Let's not tell our sad stories.
 
              Jerry laughs to himself. He admires her directness.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        I'll be right back. Quit thinking
                        those murky thoughts, okay? We're
                        young, we're semi-successful. Life
                        is good.
 
              She exits and we hang on him for a moment.


                                                                     91.
 
 
              INT. BATHROOM -- NIGHT -- MINUTES LATER
 
              Dorothy on the phone outside the bathroom.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        No, now... come on... let Chad
                        catch the bee in a glass.  He
                        won't hurt it. Aw, buddy, you got
                        such a good heart. I love you,
                        I'll be home soon.  Can't wait to
                        see you.
 
              EXT. BATHROOM
 
              Sbe exits the bathroom and stops at the sight of what is
              happening at the table. Jerry, hand on face, is
              embarrassingly being serenaded by the Mariachis, who now play
              a mournful "Tears in Heaven."  She smiles at the image, in
              fact the poetry charms her. Dorothy moves forward, grinning,
              fishes some bucks out of her pocket, and sends the Mariachis
              in another direction.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Come on, let's take a walk.
 
              INT. DOROTHY'S PORCH -- NIGHT
 
              Music feathers into sounds of night.  A bug buzzing from the
              nearby light, Jerry swats it away.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well -- this would be goodnight.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Good night.
 
              They don't kiss.  They take great care not to touch too much.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'll see you tomorrow.
 
              They don't move. On impulse, she grabs him and pulls him
              close. Kisses him.  It's a good one.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Good night.
 
              But they don't move.  He pulls her closer by her straps.
              They break.  She holds them up, nervous now. His lips travel
              down. He kisses her upper chest. She sighs deeply, she's
              missed this feeling.  Jerry rises to kiss her lips again,
              tying her straps back on. Her expression says there is a
              decision to make. She concentrates on the styrofoam container
              she's brought back from the restaurant.


                                                                     92.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing; breath)
                        I think you should not come in, or
                        come in depending on how you feel.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Same to you.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        No.  I have to go in.  I live here.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Right.  I'll come in.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Okay. Wait here a second.
                               (beat, then)
                        Do we really want to do this?
 
                                  JERRY
                               (half-unsure)
                        Oh hell yes.
 
              She exits, as shot lingers on Jerry.  That odd moment when
              you've crossed the line.  He takes a breath.
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Dorothy enters to find Chad watching t.v.  The house is now
              quiet, the remains of the Divorced Women's group is still in
              evidence.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        He's asleep, right?
 
                                  CHAD
                        Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Still going.
 
              Chad raises his eyebrows.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        Shhh.
 
              EXT. PORCH -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry on the porch, as Chad exits.  Chad now fully plays the
              part of friend with seniority.  Looks the taller Jerry up and
              down.
 
                                  CHAD
                        Treat her right, man.  She's...


                                                                     93.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (self-conscious)
                        Yeah... well...
 
                                  CHAD
                        She's great.  And I know this is
                        a little awkward, but I want you
                        to use this.
 
              Chad ruumages in bag for a moment.  Jerry is somewhat
              horrified at what Chad might be giving him.  Out comes a
              cassette tape.
 
                                  CHAD
                               (continuing; intense)
                        This... is Miles Davis and John
                        Coltrane. Stockholm.  1963... two
                        masters of freedom, playing in a
                        time before their art was
                        corrupted by a zillion cocktail
                        lounge performers who destroyed
                        the legacy of the only American
                        artform -- JAZZ.
 
              Jerry takes the tape, as the front door squeaks open.
              Dorothy shoos Chad away, quietly leads Jerry inside.
 
              INT. BEDROOM-- NIGHT
 
              Fierce, driving jazz. Dorothy and Jerry making out on bed.
              Getting hotter. The music gets wilder. Finally it is
              impossible to ignore, and Jerry collapses backwards on the
              bed laughing.  She is left frozen, her arms open but he is
              gone.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        What is this MUSIC?
 
              They both crack up, and she kisses him as the music plays. He
              looks at her. She turns away, then back again, he's still
              looking at her. It's a powerful moment for her.  Laughter
              continues, the music is ridiculous. (Their sex is a big
              difference from the let's-be-intense sex with Avery.)
 
              INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT -- SAME TIME
 
              Laurel just home from work in nurse uniform, has a late-night
              joint and carefully blows the smoke out the window.  Laughter
              from the next room.  She pops open the styrofoam appetizers
              her sister brought back from dinner.
 
                                                       DISSOLVE TO:


                                                                     94.
 
 
              INT. DOROTHY'S BEDROOM -- MORNING
 
              Radio clicks on.  It's still dark.  Only the glow of the
              digital lamp.  Jerry alone in bed.  He gets up, coughs, pulls
              on some pants.  Manuevers through a strange bedroom, steps on
              toys.
 
              INT. KITCHEN -- MORNING
 
              Dorothy and Laurel in the kitchen, waiting far the first
              possible drops of coffee.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I'm getting him up, don't worry.'
                        Ray will never see his mother's
                        raging physical needs.
 
              She starts to exit, but Laurel pulls her back far a second.

                        First you gotta tell me something.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        No--
 
              INT. HALLWAY -- MORNING
 
              Jerry moving dawn the hallway, hears voices.

                                  LAUREL
                        Because I'm worried that you're
                        putting your faith in this guy
                        who, because of the way things are
                        going, may not have an emotional
                        marble in his head.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Please, if I start talking --

                        Guys are just different people
                        when they're hanging onto the

              ON JERRY
 
              listening.  Pinned to the wall, listening to the kind of
              honesty an agent rarely hears.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        ... so what am I, for taking the
                        opportunity, Laurel?

                                  DOROTHY (cont'd)
                        Maybe I am taking advantage.  Am
                        I a bad person? All I know is that
                        I found someone who was charming
                        and popular and not-so-nice to
                        me -- and he died.  Okay?  So why
                        should I let this guy go, when
                        everything in my body says This
                        One is The One.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Easy, hon, I was just looking for
                        fun details --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Oh, well, why didn't you say so?
                        And oh, I don't know if you're
                        interested in this detail, but I
                        was just about to tell you that I
                        love him.  I love him, and I don't
                        care what you think.  I love him
                        for the guy he wants to be, and I
                        love him for the guy he almost is.
                        I love him.
 
              They look at each other. The cat is way, way out of the bag.
 
              ON JERRY
 
              rubbing his face.
 
                                  RAY
                        Hi Jerry!
 
              Dorothy leans into the hallway now, sees Jerry standing
              there, well within earshot.  As Ray pounds down the hallway
              in his new over-sized shirt, brought by Jerry, Dorothy begins
              to crumble. The lack of control in her life is overwhelming
              her.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Oh God.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Easy, easy --
 
              Jerry enters the kitchen, stands near Laurel.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        I could pretend I didn't hear, but
                        I won't, I heard everything.
                               (to Laurel)
                        Thank you for your honesty, as
                        always.


                                                                     96.

                               (frozen polite)
                        Coffee, Jerry?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Oh, no thanks.  We bottom-feeders
                        prefer cereal first --
 
                                  RAY
                        Let's have Apple Jacks!
 
              Apple Jacks it is.  Dorothy, good morning, darling. He kisses
              her on the cheek, in full view of Ray.  Dorothy, still
              embarrassed, not sure what is going on, reaches for cereal.
              Jerry sits down for breakfast.  They are an odd, but fairly
              complete-looking family.
 
                                  RAY
                               (continuing)
                        What's going on, Jerry?
 
                                  JERRY
                        A lot.  We got a big fax today...
                        we need this commission, buddy.
 
              The sisters look at each other.  Ray looks around, he feels
              happy, but there is something else in the room.  He shrugs
              and continues to feel happy.
 
              INT. JERRY'S HOME OFFICE -- LATER DAY
 
              Jerry and Dorothy prepare for the Tidwells, cleaning up the
              cramped office, unstacking chairs and making room.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        That was great of you this morning.
 
              The Tidwells honk, arriving in the driveway.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (friendly, dismissive)
                        Look, let's just root for a big
                        offer so we can move out of this
                        room to a real office.
 
              She feels slightly slapped down, but covers.  She opens a
              window quickly, and busies herself with the clutter at hand.
 
              ON FAX
 
              Connecting.


                                                                     97.
 
 
              FOUR FACES
 
              waiting for the results.  Everybody has a stake in this fax.
              Lives are very clearly hanging on this results.  Marcee shuts
              her eyes.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Read it to me, and don't say
                        anything unless it's over nine.
 
              There is a stunning disappointment on the fax.  Jerry's heart
              sinks.  His face slackens.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Aw shit --
 
              Rod turns away.  Dorothy shuts her eyes, as Marcee opens hers.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        One-point-seven for three years.
                        That's below average.  We owe more
                        than that...
 
              It is so very painful for her, as Tidwell slinks off to sit
              in a seat too small for him.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'll go back to them.
 
                                  MARCEE
                               (explodes)
                        And say what?  "Please remove your
                        dick from my ass?!"
 
              Both men look at her. The outburst has surprised even Marcee.
 
                                  MARCEE
                               (continuing)
                        I'm sorry.  I'm a little pregnant
                        right now.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I feel like crying.  I feel like
                        breaking the room up.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Okay, we don't take this
                        emotionally. We roll with this
                        problem.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        What are you talking about --
                        "don't get emotional." If you ask
                        me, you haven't gotten emotional
                        ENOUGH about this man.


                                                                     98.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Marcee --
 
                                  MARCEE
                        What DO you stand for???
 
              Dorothy looks right and left, can't hold back.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        How about a little piece of
                        integrity in this world that is so
                        filled with greed and a lack of
                        honorability that I don't know
                        what to tell my kid except take a
                        look at a guy who isn't shouting
                        "show me the money," he's quietly
                        broke and working for you for free!
                               (off Jerry's pained
                                look)
                        Well, I'm sorry, I'm not as good
                        at the insults as she is.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        No, that was pretty good.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (impressed)
                        No shit.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        In fact, you should read something
                        that meant the world to me...
 
              She opens a drawer, and withdraws the Mission Statement. She
              is headed across the room to give it to Marcee, when Jerry
              swiftly intercepts it.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Another time, okay Dorothy?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Fine, I just --
 
                                  JERRY
                        And I appreciate that impulse.
 
              Jerry throws the Mission Statement into a bottom drawer.
              Camera moves to Tidwell, and we see him for the first time
              without his protective shield of attitude.  Scared.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Tell me what to do, Jerry.  You
                        tell me to eat lima beans, I'll
                        eat lima beans.

                                  TIDWELL (cont'd)
                        If you say take the shitty deal,
                        that's all we can get --
 
                                  MARCEE
                        "All we can get?"
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Can I SPEAK with my agent here?
 
              Marcee is passionate.  Focused on Rod.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        You know what you're qonna do,
                        Rodney. You're gonna reject this
                        shitty contract. You're gonna play
                        out your existihg shitty contract
                        and go be a free agent next year
                        and the hell with Arizona. This is
                        us, and we determine our worth.
                        You're a fine, proud, surviving,
                        splendid black man.
 
              Beat.  Truer words...  The big man looks into his wife's eyes.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Honey, you are just --
 
              No one else in the world exists.  They are focused totally on
              each other.  Jerry and Dorothy in the background, just
              watching the intricate machinery of this marriage.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (continuing)
                        -- the shit.
 
              She caresses the back of his neck.  He pulls her to him.  He
              gives her a small kiss.  Dorothy and Jerry look at the
              couple, fascinated and somewhat uncomfortable.  There is a
              palpable forcefield around the Tidwells.  They are a couple
              in every passionate sense of the word.  After a beat:
 
                                  JERRY
                        If you get injured, you get
                        nothing.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Won't happen.  I'm strong in my
                        mind.
 
                                  JERRY
                        It's a risk.
 
              Jerry looks over to Dorothy, who grits her teeth at the
              implications of the decision.


                                                                     100.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Bet on me, dude.  Bet on me like
                        I bet on you.
 
              Tidwell puts his hand out.  Maguire is conflicted, but he
              takes a breath and shakes.
 
              EXT. JERRY'S HOME OFFICE -- LATE AFTERNOON
 
              Tidwell and Marcee exit.  Dorothy and Jerry on the lawn.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'll get you some quick work --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Good deal, man.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        I'm sorry what I said back there.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Don't be silly.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        My husband believes in you.  We're
                        gonna make it.  Bye bye Dorothy.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Take care you guys.
 
              Tidwells exit.  Finally, Dorothy and Jerry are alone.  The
              Tidwell situation has left an ominious feeling in the air.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        Look...  I was up for a job in San
                        Diego before I left SMI. It's with
                        the Chargers.

              touching down.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Don't even talk about that yet.
                        I'll find something fast for
                        Tidwell. We'll stay afloat.
 
              EXT. COMMERCIAL SET/TAYLOR CHEVROLET/ARIZONA -- DAY
 
              Tidwell stands on the set of a regional Arizona car
              commercial. It is a hot day.  Three other bored, large
              Arizona athletes wait by a coffee machine, as Jerry's friend,
              director Bill Dooler appears ready to implode.  Dooler is
              arguing with Tidwell.


                                                                     101.
 
 
              Maguire stands slightly away, acting as referee.  Nearby, a
              camel.
 
                                  DOOLER
                        Look, Rod, just get on the camel!
 
                                  JERRY
                        Bill, Rod, wait --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Dude, know your art form.  If you
                        put the camera down here, looking
                        up, I look more powerful.  There's
                        no need for a camel... you got ME.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Rod, get on the camel.
 
                                  DOOLER
                               (shoots look to Jerry)
                        The sponsor wants a camel --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Jerry, back me up.  It's either
                        the camel or me...
 
              Tidwell waves his arms, spooking the camel, who spits and
              stormps. Several crew members scatter in various directions.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (takes the bullet)
                        Airight.  Enough.  I'm pulling him
                        out of this.  This isn't what I
                        had in mind anyway.
 
                                  DOOLER
                        Then you shouldn't have begged me
                        to hire him.
 
              EXT. SET -- LATER
 
              Jerry and Tidwell walk quickly from the set.  In the
              background, another athlete rides the camel.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        There you go, dude.  You're
                        learning how to represent me.  We
                        ain't gonna bring Nike to their
                        knees with some regional camel
                        ad --
 
              Jerry rubs his face.


                                                                     102.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Can I ask you a question totally
                        unrelated to your career?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Oh, we gonna be friends now?
 
                                  JERRY
                        What do you know about dating a
                        single mother?
 
              Tidwell warms to the personal question.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Oh I know plenty.  I was raised by
                        a single mother.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Tell me, because it's been a
                        month, and she's about to take
                        another job in San Diego.
 
              Tidwell is always happy to hold forth.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        First, single mothers don't
                        "date." They have been to the
                        circus, you know what I'm saying?
                        They have been to the puppet show
                        and they have seen the strings.
                        You love her?
 
                                  JERRY
                        How do I know?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        You know when you know.  It makes
                        you shivver, it eats at your
                        insides. You know?
 
                                  JERRY
                        No, I don't know.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Then you gotta have The Talk.
 
                                  JERRY
                        But I sure don't like that she's
                        leaving.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Well, that ain't fair to her.  A
                        single mother, that's a sacred
                        thing, man.


                                                                     103.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        The kid is amazing.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (shaking head)
                        No.  A real man does not shoplift
                        the "pooty" from a single mom.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I didn't "shoplift the pooty."  We
                        were thrown together and -- I mean
                        it's two mutual people who --
                               (a look)
                        Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Shame on you.  SHAME on you.
 
              INT. ZOO -- DAY
 
              Jerry, Dorothy and Ray at the zoo.  Ray straining at Jerry's
              arm. Life-changing decisions in the air.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        They offered me everything I asked
                        for, it's only 2 hours away. I
                        think it's good for us.
 
              Jerry feels tugged in many directions, and not just by Ray.
              They approach the reptile house.
 
                                  RAY
                        Show me the animal, Jerry!
 
                                  JERRY
                        Right up ahead, buddy --
 
              They approach the Reptile House, where a small crowd is
              gathered.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        -- I give you my favorite animal
                        in the zoo.  Are you ready for the
                        weirdness, the strange perfection
                        and truth of...
 
                                  RAY
                        I'm scared.  What is it?
 
                                  JERRY
                        It's in a cage.  Do not be scared
                        of...
 
              A few people peel away, revealing...


                                                                     104.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        The Two-Headed Corn Snake.
 
              THE TWO-HEADED CORN SNAKE
 
              A friendly but confused looking reptile.  The snake has two
              heads, both identical, both twisting and battling each other
              for direction.  Aw-ed chatter around the animal ranges from
              "weird" and "wow" to "mira mira!  Dos cabezas!"  Few can turn
              away.
 
                                  RAY
                        Whoa.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (quietly)
                        Two heads.  My God...
 
              Jerry is happy to play tour-guide.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Both heads have brains.  Both
                        heads eat, both heads battle for
                        direction all day long.
                               (meaningful)
                        Man, can I relate.
 
              The odd animal moves forward, fighting itself constantly.
 
                                  RAY
                        Me too.
 
              Dorothy just looks at the two men in her life.  She turns to
              Anonymous Man standing nearby, staring at the animal.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Is this a guy thing?
 
                                  ANONYMOUS MAN
                        It is, and it isn't.
 
              ON THE TWO-HEADED CORN SNAKE
 
              strangely endearing, jittering and moving around the cage.
 
              EXT. DOROTHY'S FRONT YARD -- DAY
 
              A U-Haul is parked in the driveway.  Inside the cab, a very
              sad Ray.  Jerry approaches carefully.  Ray does not look at
              him.  He opens the door, scoots the kid over, and sits next
              to him.


                                                                     105.
 
 
              EXT. DOROTHY'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY
 
              Laurel and Dorothy say goodbye.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        You're doing the right thing. I
                        mean, come on.  You need to start
                        your life and he... he needs a
                        warm body to cushion the fall.
                        Check out exhibit A on the front
                        lawn --
 
              POV -- THE SISTERS
 
              We see Jerry, following Chad back to the house, saying
              goodbye too many times. He's anxious not to be left alone.
              Finally Chad grabs him by the shoulders, says goodbye, as a
              sad Ray trudges to the cab of the U-Haul.  Jerry now follows
              Ray to the car.
 
              EXT. DOROTHY'S PLACE -- DAY
 
              Jerry scoots a very sad Ray over, and talks to him in the car.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'm not good at this.
 
              Ray begins to cry. Jerry is incapable of dealing with it.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        I'll see you this weekend, okay?
                        Promise.
 
              Ray wails.  Jerry squeezes his shoulder, it does nothing, so
              he exits. He rises and faces Dorothy, keys in hand.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Sure you're okay to drive this?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        This rig? Phht.  No problem.
 
                                  JERRY
                        So I'll see you this weekend.
 
              She accepts it casually, with a shrug.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Airight, so goodbye and --
                               (simple, with shrug)
                        I love you.
 
              Jerry blinks.


                                                                     106.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (too quick, weirdly)
                        ... I love you too, you know.
 
              She reacts with an odd look.  The words don't sound right,
              and he knows that she knows.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        What --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Look, just in case this weekend
                        becomes next month and next month
                        becomes... whatever...
                               (beat)
                        Don't make a joke of your life.
                        Go back and read what you wrote.
                        You're better than the rest of
                        them, better than the Bob Sugars,
                        and don't forget it.
 
              He shudders a little with the intimacy of her words.  She
              kisses him, and moves quickly toward the car, leaving him
              alone in frame. He grows increasingly uncomfortable.  He
              watches her leave.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Wait a second.
 
              ON DOROTHY
 
              moving to her car.  She hears him.  It's not loud enough for
              her.
 
                                  JERRY
                        WAIT A SECOND!
 
              She stops, smiling very slightly to herself , biting her lip.
              She turns and he is now close to her.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        I know a way to s... to save on
                        Medical and rent and... look...
 
              He grips one hand with the other.  Dorothy looks at his
              strange behavior.  He looks over to the cab, where Ray is
              making a sad face at him through the window.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        ...  what if we stayed together?
                        What if we uh... got married.


                                                                     107.
 
 
              She looks at him.  It's an odd proposal.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        If I said that, would you stay?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say
                        that if you don't...
 
                                  JERRY
                        Will you marry me?
 
              She looks at him, full of love, dabbing at her mascara.
 
              EXT. DOROTHY'S BACKYARD -- DAY
 
              Rod Tidwell sings Marvin Gaye's "What's Going On" at the
              wedding for assorted guests gathered here in the backyard.
              Contrary to his own belief, Rod is not a gifted singer.  In
              the wedding band, standing on a small stage in the corner,
              are Chad and Dooler.
 
              ON JERRY
 
              who stands watching, smile pasted on, with stoic FATHER and
              well-dressed BROTHER.
 
                                  BROTHER
                        Where are all your friends?
 
                                  JERRY
                               (looking around)
                        In the band.
 
              INT. DOROTHY'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              We are close on Ray now as we hear the sound of a Reverend
              reading wedding vows.  Ray holds the ring, and waits for his
              cue to offer it.  But he has forgotten the cue.  And every
              time the Reverend pauses, he starts to offer the ring.
 
              Dorothy's leg and hand are visible in frame.  She calms him
              with a hand on the shoulder.  And finally the cue comes and
              he offers the ring.
 
              INT. DOROTHY'S HALLWAY/KITCHEN -- NIGHT
 
              The bride and groom catch each other, post-wedding, in the
              hallway of the small home where the event has taken place.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Wow.  We actually --


                                                                     108.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Yeah, we did.
 
              Giddy, Dorothy heads into the living room where Friends and
              relatives watch the video of the wedding. And now the
              enormity is evident on Jerry's face. Warm laughter in the
              b.g.  More laughter and family noise in the background now.
              He holds onto a table for a moment, steadies himself.  Jerry
              takes a breath and moves into the kitchen.  Finds a beer.  He
              turns and finds himself alone with Laurel, for the first
              time.  She raises her beer.  They toast, warily.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        If you fuck this up, I'll kill you.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (as she exits)
                        Glad we had this talk!
 
              Nearby, Tidwell watches all.  He moves to Jerry.
              Confidentially:
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        You never had The Talk, did you?
 
                                  JERRY
                        No.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Well, this was another way to go.
 
              Jerry smiles.  Dorothy brings Jerry a Poloraid someone took,
              and for a moment the couple stands awkwardly together.
              Tidwell rubs Jerry's shoulders a little, announcing to the
              room:
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (continuing)
                        This is my agent, man!  And we're
                        all gonna have a great season!
 
              He pounds Jerry on the back, hard, shaking him like a pinata.
 
                                                       FADE TO
 
              EXT. PHILADELPHIA PLAYING FIELD -- DAY
 
              Tidwell catches the ball, takes a vicious hit. The season is
              on.
 
              INT. PHILADELPHIA PRESS BOX -- DAY
 
              Across the room, he sees GM Dennis Wilburn standing with
              Avery.


                                                                     109.
 
 
              He turns away, passing a monitor where elsewhere in the
              country, Frank Cushman is having another sensational Sunday.
 
              INT. TIDWELL LIVING ROOM/PHOENIX -- DAY
 
              This is the Tidwell family ritual of watching Rod's games on
              the big-screen home t.v.  At the center is Marcee Tidwell.
              Everything flows from her.  Next to her is Tyson, and then
              the cousins, the neighborhood friends.  At this particular
              moment, they are all screaming for Rod, who is taking a
              beating, but is having a hell of a game.  In front of the
              t.v., Tyson does the "Daddy Dance," a dance of pure joy.
 
                                  TYSON
                               (proudly, to family)
                        That's my motherfucker!
 
              Marcee reaches out and collars her dancing son.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Why don't you be the first man in
                        your family not to say that word?
                        And then we'll let you live.
 
              Tyson nods, wide-eyed.
 
                                  MARCEE
                               (continuing)
                        Now go kiss your daddy, quick.
 
                                  TEE PEE
                               (cooly)
                        That's why they cheer, you know.
                        The white man sending the black
                        man into battle...
 
              Marcee shoots him a look, as Tidwell takes another rough hit.
 
              INT. STADIUM HALLWAY -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry stands waiting.  Bob Sugar nearby, greeting quarterback
              JOHN SWENSON.  Still no Tidwell.
 
              EXT. PHILADELPHIA LOCKER ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Finally, here comes Tidwell, moving very slowly with garmet
              bag.
 
                                  JERRY
                        How's your head? Bubblicious.


                                                                     110.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Tidwell moves to a tan in a
                        wheelchair, signs an autograph and
                        moves on.  Jerry alongside. The
                        quarterback sucks, man.  He's
                        gonna get me killed.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'm a little worried --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I'm worried too.  I'm worried that
                        the only reason I'm here getting
                        my brains blown loose is that you
                        weren't asshole enough to get my
                        ten million three months ago.
 
                                  INSANE FAN
                               (interrupting loudly)
                        FUCKIN ROD TIDWELL YOU RULE YOU
                        RULE!  I WON A FUCKIN, A FUCKIN
                        MUG ON YOU IN MY ROTISS...
                        ROTLISS...
 
              With great skill, Tidwell pats the fan and moves him along to
              other tired players.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Peace, my drunken brother.  Ahd
                        don't discuss gambling with me.
 
              Insane fan moves to another player.  Jerry proceeds carefully.
 
                                  JERRY
                        We can still take the offer, Rod.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (stops)
                        No.
 
              Jerry regards his slightly befuddled friend.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, just stay healthy. I will
                        show you the kwan.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (irritated)
                        Hey, that's my word, okay?
 
              Tidwell wearily heads for the bus.  Jerry stands in the
              parking lot.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'll see you in Arizona.


                                                                     111.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I'm gonna have the game of my life
                        on Monday Night Football, and show
                        all these motherfuckers.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Take care, okay? You're my entire
                        client roster.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Don't I know.  Now go home to your
                        wife.
 
                                  JERRY
                        What's that supposed to mean?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Why are you even here, man? You
                        could have told me all this over
                        the phone.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I don't know -- how's "dedication"
                        for an answer?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        You don't want to go home, do you?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I'm asking you a question --
 
                                  JERRY
                        No, you're --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I'm trying to talk to you.  How's
                        your marriage?
 
              Jerry looks at Rod for a moment.  It is the simplest
              question, and one in which he has no quick answer.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Not everyone has what you have.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Then why'd you get married?  I'm
                        asking you as a friend.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (shaking his head)
                        You're jabbing at me.


                                                                     112.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I'm sorry I asked.
 
                                  JERRY
                        No, I'm going to answer you.  You
                        want an answer?  I'll give it to
                        you.

                        Everything grew from there.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        That's an answer.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Damn right.

                               (jab)
                        For loyalty, you buy a dog.  For
                        love, you get married.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Look.  I'm happy to entertain you,
                        as always, but I have a question
                        for you.  Are we really "friends?"
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Why not --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, friends can tell each other
                        anything, right? If we have our
                        "friends" hats on --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (wary)
                        I think so.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (intense)
                        Airight.  Here's why you don't
                        have your ten million dollars yet.
                        You are a paycheck player.  You
                        play with your head.  Not your
                        heart.  In your personal life?
                               (points)

                        wide-angle lenses and who fucked
                        you over and who owes you for it.
                        That's not what inspires people.
                        I'm sorry, but that's the truth,
                        can you handle it? Just a
                        "question," Rod.  Between friends.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I don't want to be friends anymore.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Fine.

                        Only 'cause my wife likes your
                        wife!
 
              Jerry exits.  Tidwell is pissed.  And hurt.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (continuing)
                        "No heart."  "No heart?"

                        I'm all heart, motherfucker!

              INT. CRAB RESTAURANT -- NIGHT
 
              The Tidwells and the Maguires.  Tyson and Ray run around the
              table of this family-style restaurant. Marcee is very very
              pregnant. They crack crabs for each other, seasoning for each
              other, feeding each other like one many-armed and loving body.

                        attractions. All black films, all
                        violent, I'm talking about
                        brothers shooting brothers, Wesley
                        Snipes with guns the size of our

                        cars crashing... blood blood blood
                        blood. Is this all they think we
                        want to see? Come on!  I enjoyed
                        Shindler's List.  Give me a little

              Sitting across the table, stunned, just watching this
              intricate and perfect marriage.
 
              SHOT OF MARCEE
 
              She takes a breath and gets a weird look.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        What baby?
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Baby.  Baby.  Baby...
 
              INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Marcee gives birth, Rod assisting.  Jerry and Dorothy watch
              from behind thick glass.  She hangs her arm on his shoulder,
              looks at him.  Jerry stares straight ahead. Mortified, with
              dry throat.
 
              INT. DOROTHY AND JERRY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry and Dorothy exhausted, alone, getting ready for bed.
              Dorothy sits down near him on the bed.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        What were you thinking tonight?
                        Watching them go through the
                        complete human emotional
                        experience?


                                                                     115.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        I was thinking I hope he doesn't
                        get injured. I felt responsible.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Sometimes I can't tell at all,
                        what's going through that head of
                        yours.
 
              He makes a noise. As in -- it's no big mystery.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        And I really don't know your
                        noises yet.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, when you wonder, ask me.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (unsatisfied)

                                  JERRY
                        Why do you love me?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Why do you love me?
 
              It is, of course, the better question.  And before he can
              answer, there is a pounding at the door.
 
                                  RAY
                        Jerry, can I come in and watch
                        t.v.?
 
                           DOROTHY                       JERRY
                   I'll come visit you in a      Just for a few minutes,
                   second --                     buddy --
 
              The door flies open and Ray comes bounding in, onto the bed,
              stations himself in the center and begins wrestling Jerry for
              the remote control.  Dorothy watches, disconnected.  A
              steeliness comes over her that we have not yet seen.
 
              INT. PRESCHOOL -- NEXT DAY
 
              Dorothy drops Ray at preschool, and stands in the doorway of
              the playroom.  She watches the boys and girls playing
              together in a room full of bright colors and games.  Music.

              EXT. RAY'S PLAYHOUSE -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry sits finishing a phone call to an advertising account
              exec. He has come here, to Ray's playhouse for privacy.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Tonight.  Yeah, the red-eye, I'll
                        be in Arizona on Monday...
 
              Jerry adlibs some salesmanship on Tidwell's behalf.   Dorothy
              approaches.  She gives him a few phone messages, sits down.
              Beat of silence.  He sees a look on her face that is
              unfamiliar.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        It's my fault.

                                  DOROTHY
                        I took advantage of you and worst
                        of all, I'm not alone. I did this
                        with a kid.  I was just on some
                        ride where I thought I was in 1ove
                        enough for both of us.  I did
                        this.  And at least I can do
                        something about it now.

                               (damage control)
                        Well -- I'm not the guy who's
                        going to run.  I stick.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I don't need you to "stick."

                        mean, come on.  It's the theme of

                        I know.  I watched it.  I sort of
                        know it by heart.

                        I don't like to give up.

                        Oh please.  My need to make the
                        best of things, and your need to
                        be what, "responsible"... if one
                        of us doesn't say something now we
                        might lose ten years being polite
                        about it. Why don't we call this
                        next road trip what it is.  A nice
                        long break.
 
                                  JERRY
                        What about Ray?
 
              She notes the only real glimpse of ache, in that question.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        There's no question you'll be
                        friends. Of course you'll be
                        friends.
 
                                  JERRY
                        So this break... is a break-up.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Come on, Jerry.  You know this
                        isn't easy for me.

                                                                     118.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY (cont'd)
                        I mean, on the surface, you'd
                        almost think everything was fine.
                        See, I've got this great guy who
                        loves my kid --
                               (resolute, no tears)
                        -- and he sure does like me a lot.
 
              Jerry Maguire, a man who speaks for a living, has nothing to
              say.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        I can't live that way.  It's not
                        the way I'm "built."
 
              He moves to embrace her.  She pulls away first.
 
              INT. RAY'S ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry kisses sleepy Ray goodbye.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Don't wake up...
 
              And then faces the exotic fish who now resides on Ray's
              table.  He once lived in a tank the size of a Cadillac.  The
              fish now hangs in a too-small bowl, looking at him.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing;
                                defensive)
                        ...  it was just a Mission
                        Statement...
 
              INT. AIRPORT --  DAY
 
              Jerry Maguire stretches his arms out.  A security wand passes
              over him.  Deadness in his eyes. The glaze of the road on
              him.  Music.
 
              EXT. SUN DEVIL STADIUM -- ARIZONA
 
              We are hovering in the sky, just above Sun Devil Stadium.
 
              The classic Monday Night Football shot from the blimp.
 
              INT. TIDWELL LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Tidwell's family in the living room.  A buzz in the air.  The
              pregame show is on, sound-muted. Old-school on the stereo.
              Everybody is happy.  Marcee sits in the position of honor,
              her new baby KAYDEE in her arms.   She is a tired mother, and
              the family celebrates her.


                                                                     119.
 
 
                                  TEE PEE
                        He'd better not mess up on Monday
                        Night Football.
 
              Marcee shoots Tee Pee a look.
 
                                  TEE PEE
                               (continuing)
                        What did I say?  He gets nervous
                        for the t.v. games... it's not a
                        secret.
 
              INT. TUNNEL AREA/PRE-GAME -- NIGHT
 
              Nervous Tidwell chews a toothpick as he stands checking out
              the field.  Nearby, some cheerleaders and a man in a Pickle
              suit.
 
                                  PICKLE MAN
                        Nothing like Monday Night, huh?
                        What is it, 2 billion viewers?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (irritated)
                        Shouldn't you be out there doing
                        some pickle dance or something --
                        Pickle Man nods and goes out to
                        dance for the crowd.
 
                                  VOICE
                        Hey Rod -- hey Buddydude --
 
              Tidwell turns.  It's Bob Sugar approaching. Laser-like, ready
              to feed on his insecurity.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Listen, I spoke to your
                        quarterback. He's my client, you
                        know.  And I said, "take care to
                        get those passes down, let Tidwell
                        look good on t.v."
 
              Tidwell looks at him, chews his toothpick.
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (continuing)
                        You should let me do more for you.
                        I would have had you your deal by
                        tonight.  Al Michaels is a friend
                        of mine. I would have had him on
                        the air, talking about you,
                        tonight, when it counts.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Get outta here.  Go.


                                                                     120.
 
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Where's your agent tonight?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Don't know.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Rod.  I know this is "uncool" to
                        do this now, but you belong with
                        the big boys.  You belong with the
                        money. You belong with --
 
              Here comes Jerry Maguire.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Get the fuck away from my guy,
                        Sugar.
 
              Tidwell can't help it.  He beams as he sees his agent
              approach.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Jerry!  You made it --
 
                                  JERRY
                               (off Sugar)
                        Go.  Flee.
 
              Sugar retreats, offering one final look to Rod, think about
              what I said.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Thanks for coming.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (bittersweet)
                        I missed ya.  What can I say?
 
              INT. TIDWELL HOME -- NIGHT
 
              They watch the game.
 
                                  GIFFORD (ON T.V.)
                        It's a bruiser out there tonight.
 
                                  MICHAELS (ON T.V.)
                        Arizona refusing to go into the
                        quiet night of this rough football
                        season. Come on, I'm trying to be
                        poetic here.
 
              Tidwell takes a rough hit, and they respond loudly.


                                                                     121.
 
 
                                  DIERDORF (ON T.V.)
                        Ooof.  Another rough hit across
                        the middle on Rod Tidwell.
                        Nothing poetic about that.
 
              INT. PRESS BOX -- NIGHT
 
              Maguire moves through the box.
 
              INT. FIELD -- NIGHT
 
              Tidwell takes a hit.  Hangs onto the ball.
 
              INT. TIDWELL LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              The Tidwell clan are banging on t.v. trays and whooping
              loudly. But in the middle of the cheers, Marcee sees the
              unsettled look on young Tyson's face.   She pulls him over to
              her, giving him preference over baby Kaydee.  He is the only
              thing in her world, as she says:
 
                                  MARCEE
                        What does daddy say?
 
                                  TYSON
                        "It looks worse than it is...
 
              Marcee gives him a kiss, as Tidwell makes another grueling
              gain on the field.
 
                                  FRANK GIFFORD'S VOICE
                        They don't pay enough for a man to
                        take that kind of ugly hit --
 
                                  MARCEE
                               (to others)
                        Boy, no s-h-i-t.
 
              Big laughs from the living room.  Except Tee Pee.
 
                                  TEE PEE
                        He's gonna have nothing left for
                        next season.  They're letting him
                        kill himself.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Can you be quiet?
 
                                  TEE PEE
                        What'd I say?
 
              INT. PRESS BOX -- NIGHT
 
              Maguire watches as Arizona's quarterback John Swenson drops
              back for a pass, and is sacked.


                                                                     122.
 
 
              Philadelphia fans cheer wildly.  The game is turning uglier
              by the minute.  Jerry looks up to the monitor for a closet
              look at the next play.
 
              ON PRESS BOX MONITOR
 
              Swenson, the Arizona quarterback, throws a wobbly pass into
              the end-zone.  Tidwell leaps for the catch, tucks the ball in
              and is promptly and brutally hit by two defenders from two
              different sides.  This hit is bad.  Worse than bad.  Tidwell
              flips and comes down like a sack of potatoes, with a thud,
              ball still in his hands. His head hits the astroturf, hard.
              Tidwell is out cold.  And the ripple effect of the injury
              shoots through the stadium.  Jerry stares at the monitor,
              stunned by the sudden brutality.
 
              EXT. ARIZONA FIELD -- NIGHT
 
              We are thrust into the vortex, inside the game.  Tidwell lies
              still on turf.  Overhead, the fight music continues for a few
              seconds before disappearing abruptly. Players and coaches
              begin to gather around the still body of Rod Tidwell.
 
              TV MONITOR -- SLO-MO
 
              The hit in replay.  It is brutal.  And we can see a flash of
              his pride as he catches the lousy pass, and then... like two
              bulls, the Philadelphia defenders enter from each side.  One
              cuts his legs out from under him, and Rod's taut body
              literally flips.  The second defender then hits him at the
              shoulders.  Tidwell lands on the back of his neck, crumpling
              downwards.  Still holding the ball.  Still.
 
              INT. TIDWELL LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Silence.  Utter silence.
 
                                  GIFFORD'S VOICE
                        --   you sure hope his family
                        wasn't watching that.
 
              And then, in a cry that gurgles from way down deep, Marcee
              begins to sob.  Camera catches the face of Tyson, now
              panicked.  Scared, he embraces his mother.
 
              INT. BOWELS OF SUN DEVIL STADIUM
 
              Maguire sprints through the inner bowels of the stadium.  He
              turns the corner, into the tunnel, talking his way past a
              guard, heading into the bright t.v. light of the football
              field.


                                                                     123.
 
 
              INT. TIDWELL LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Gathering around the television, the family waits through a
              commercial for more information on Rod's injury.
 
                                  TEE PEE
                        He should have kept his head
                        tucked down.
 
                                  MARCEE
                               (immediately)
                        Shut up!!!
 
                                  TEE PEE
                        I'm not putting him down, I just
                        have a commitment to the truth.
 
              Marcee lunges for him.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Can't you be loyal to your brother
                        who LOVES you??
                               (she is held back)
                        Get out of my house!
 
              Across the room, the phone starts ringing.  A COUSIN answers.
 
                                  COUSIN
                        It's Jerry Maguire!
 
              EXT. ARIZONA FIELD -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry Maguire on the portable.
 
                                  JERRY
                        He took a shot.  He's unconscious.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        I'm freakin out.  Oh God I'm --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Keep the phone open.  I'll call

                        good doctors out there.

                        "Stay calm?"  I'm freakin...
 
                                  JERRY
                        Alright, I'm freaking too.  But
                        they need you to stay calm.  I'll
                        call back.

                        My whole life is this family,
                        Jerry. It doesn't work without him.
 
              She takes a big gulp, as Jerry watches an overzealous Trainer
              run out onto the field to join the cluster around the fallen
              Tidwell. Jerry covers phone and yells onto the field.
 
                                  JERRY
                        DON'T TOUCH HIM!!!
 
              EXT. CENTER OF PLAYING FIELD -- NIGHT
 
              We're now just a few inches in front of his peaceful,
              sleeping face.  They are all. YELLING, trying to pull him out.
 
              SHOTS OF NATIONAL TELEVISION AUDIENCES
 
              1)   A full sports bar in arizona silently watches Monday
              Night Football.
 
              2)   Generic living room of sports fans, all watching Tidwell
              pinned to the screen.
 
              3)   Generic outdoor bar-b-que as white fans watch t.V.

              Dead to the world as sound disappears. There is now only
              silence.
 
              POV TIDWELL - SLO-MO -- SILENCE
 
              The Doctors and the Trainers are now truly panicked.  We
              don't hear them.   We see them, their motions increasingly
              manic. Shoving fingers in front of him.  Screaming.  We read
              their lips.  ("Rod!" "Rod can you hear us!")  We see the
              anguish and escalating fear on their faces.  The Trainer
              leans in close, bellowing, he spreads his hands wide to clap
              right in front of Rod's still face.  His hands head toward
              each other... closer... bringing with them the first inkling
              of sound...  getting closer and then finally coming together,
              bringing with him the sounds of the stadium.
 
              ON TIDWELL
 
              who blinks back to life.  Concerned men are yelling very
              loudly, right in his face.  Tidwell becomes aware he is the
              absolute center of attention of the entire stadium.  As crowd
              noise begins to rise.


                                                                     125.

                        Let's get you off the field!
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Wait.
 
                                  TRAINER
                        Can you feel your legs?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Yeah.  Just let me enjoy this for
                        a minute.

              Crowd noise rises.  Is he okay?
 
              ON TIDWELL
 
              Can he move?  Is he okay?
 
              ON TIDWELL'S LIVING ROOM
 
              Not a breath is taken.  Is he okay?
 
              He rises.  Stadium explodes.  At first on wobbly feet, he
              raises the football and for the first time -- salutes the
              crowd.  Crowd noise doubles.

              gasping for breath.
 
              ON TIDWELL
 
              Has never felt like this before in his life.  It is the pure
              and absolute love of the spotlight.  And his fans.
 
              And then... it's real and he feels it.  Tidwell breaks out in
              a small but unmistakable move -- a flutter step.  He does a
              high-stepping move, all his own, for about ten yards.
 
              ON JERRY MAGUIRE
 
              who watches, now in complete disbelief. Tidwell will not let
              go of the spotlight.
 
              ON TIDWELL'S LIVING ROOM
 
              Going absolutely nuts.  Marcee hysterical, laughing and
              crying.

              Finishes his small but heartfelt dance.  It is a personal
              catharsis he is sharing now with 2 billion people.

                        Nike.
 
              He moves past Jerry Maguire on his way off the field. Jerry,
              casually thumps his heart twice. Jerry Maguire is overcome
              with emotion.  He sits down on a camera case, head in his
              hands.  Behind him, a stadium cheers a new hero.
 
                                  OVERHEARD FAN
                        I always knew he was great.
 
              Maguire rubs his face.  Overcome. Photographers and others
              rush past to be closer to Tidwell.
 
              INT. TUNNEL -- LATER
 
              Jerry Maguire surrounded by well-wishers and backslappers and
              Sportswriters.  Success has returned, in all of it's
              superficial grandeur.  He is a star again, by association.
              We catch the look on Maguire's face.  Try as he might, he
              can't manufacture the joy of the moment.  There is a void.
              Over the heads of the heatseekers we see Dennis Wilburn
              nodding, holding a thumbs up.  He tries to get to Maguire,
              but cannot.  And then a commotion behind them all.
 
                                  REPORTER
                        It's Tidwell!
 
              Tidwell exits the locker room.  Press and media surround him.
              Even the grizzled old-time stadium workers reach in to
              squeeze him, to slap him, to touch him.  He works his way to
              Maguire.
 
              They hug. Cameras flash.  Tears roll down from beneath his
              purple shades.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        We did it.
 
              And now, in the middle of this emotional union, a portable
              phone rings.  Both men reach for their porties.  It's
              Maguire's.  With anticipation, he answers.


                                                                     127.

                        couldn't get through on your phone.
 
              Tidwell grabs the phone, and joyously shares the moment with
              his wife.  Jerry watches, as Tidwell leans on his shoulder.

              Rod Tidwell sings karoake, on stage.  He's struggling through
              U2's "One."  In the audience are many Arizona players, as
              well as most of Tidwell's family.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        One love... you got to share it...

              We move past many Big Men celebrating Tidwell, singing along,
              sharing their Monday Night victory, onto melancholy Jerry
              Maguire. He watches, cellular at his side, as a YOUNG AGENT
              approaches.
 
                                  YOUNG AGENT
                        Jerry Maguire.  I'm Tommy Bendis.
                        You don't know me, I'm a new
                        agent, just getting started.  I
                        represent that place kicker over
                        there.
                               (indicates kicker)
                        I wondered if you would sign this
                        for me. Because it inspired me.
 
              He withdraws a well-thumbed copy of Jerry's Mission
              Statement.  The blue cover is ripped along one edge.  It
              clearly has served as a manifesto for this younger man's
              career.


                                                                     128.
 
 
              ON JERRY MAGUIRE
 
              He feels the cover, flips through it a little.  Memories
              flood with the passing pages.   Shot holds on Jerry's face,
              as Tidwell continues singing in the background.  Suddenly, an
              odd feeling.  A shiver runs up and down his spine.  His
              forehead tingles.  He rubs his face.  All he can do is think
              of Dorothy.
 
                                  AGENT
                        Just make it out "To Tommy".

              Jerry Maquire sprints through the empty airport, heading for
              the last flight out of town.  Music.
 
              INT. DOROTHY'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              The Divorced Women's Group in session.  Laurel stands near
              the doorway, blowing cigarette smoke into the night.  Dorothy
              is now a part of this group.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I've listened to you all tell a
                        thousand sob stories, and I have
                        been very judgmental. Frankly, I
                        think you've all been waaaay too
                        comfortable with your pain.  Plus,
                        Jan, you always spill your red
                        wine on the couch.
                               (off Jan's guilty
                                look)
                        I've not been fair to you.  Women
                        need to stick together, and not
                        depend on the affections of a man
                        to "fix" their lives.  Maybe
                        you're all correct. Men are the
                        enemy.
 
              Murmurs of agreement.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        But I still love the enemy.
 
              Murmurs of disappointment.

              EXT. DOROTHY'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry exits cab, holding hang-up bag.  Looks at the house.
              On the other side of that window is a world he hopes he's
              still a part of.
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry enters.  Dorothy is seated toward the back.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Hello.  I'm looking for my wife.
 
              Dorothy looks up, robbed of words.  Stunned, she does not
              move.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Alright.  If this is where it has
                        to happen, then this is where it
                        has to happen.
 
              Dorothy says nothing.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        I'm not letting you get rid of me.
                        How about that?
 
              He shares a look with some of the other women.  She's not
              going to say a word.  Neither do they.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        This used to be my specialty. I
                        was good in a living room.  Send
                        me in there, I'll do it alone. And
                        now I just... I don't know... but
                        on what was supposed to be the
                        happiest night of my business
                        life, it wasn't complete, wasn't
                        nearly close to being in the same
                        vicinity as complete, because I
                        couldn't share it with you.  I
                        couldn't hear your voice, or laugh
                        about it with you.  I missed my
                        wife.  We live in a cynical world,
                        and we work in a business of tough
                        competitors, so try not to laugh --
                               (directly)
                        I love you.  You complete me.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Aw, shut up.  You had me at hello.


                                                                     130.
 
 
              He moves to her.  They embrace.  Ray watches in b.g.  Jerry
              has given this room hope.  It's on their faces. At last, even
              Laurel gets off on her sister's happiness, as she shares a
              look with Chad.

                        ...your father who left the family
                        on Christmas eve, the mother who
                        cleaned the steps of a prison to
                        make your tuition. The older
                        brother who lost a leg in that
                        tragic bass fishing accident --
 
              Tidwell is wearing glasses now, in a somewhat scholarly mode.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        No, Roy.  I'm not gonna cry.

                        -- well, Rod, your agent passed me
                        a note before the show. He says
                        that your deal memo has been
                        signed by the Arizona Cardinals.

                                  TIDWELL
                        I... I love everybody, man.  I
                        love my wife.  My kids.  Little
                        Tyson. My new baby Kaydee.  My
                        brother Tee Pee. I love my
                        friends, my teammates, who am I
                        leaving out?

                        It's only a half-hour show, Rod.

              watching off-camera.  Marcee crying too.  Shot takes us to
              Jerry, Dorothy and Ray.

                                  TIDWELL
                        Wanna send some beautiful love out
                        to my offensive line, just a
                        beautiful bunch of dudes, wanna
                        thank a beautiful individual --
                        God, and of course the entire
                        Arizona organization, a little
                        slow, but they do come around.
                        I'm leaving somebody out...
 
              Amused and finally glimpsing the end of a long journey, Jerry
              leans over to Marcee.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Take care, Marcee.  We'll see you
                        at the restaurant.
 
              She nods, emotionally, biting her lip.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Oh yes.  Jerry Maguire!  My agent!
                        This is a fierce, loving
                        individual, I love this man, he is
                        love, he is about love -- my
                        ambassador of kwan.
 
                                  FIRESTONE
                        Ten seconds, Rod.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        And I love my fans, of which he is
                        one. Wanna thank them for all my
                        Sundays, and of course my Monday
                        nights too.  That about says it...
 
              Jerry watches wonderously at the monitor before leaving. TV
              credits are rolling on the show.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (continuing)
                        Wait!  And thank you Melvin from
                        the Casual Man, thank you for the
                        suit...
 
              EXT. PARKING LOT -- DAY
 
              Jerry, Dorothy, Ray exit into the daylight.  They walk to
              Jerry's car. From across the fence, a stray baseball from a
              pick-up game flies into the parking lot and bounces ahead of
              them.  Ray picks it up. In an easy fluid motion, he whips it
              back over the fence to the game on the other side.  A few
              kids on the other side of the fence shout their approval of
              a great little throw.


                                                                     132.
 
 
              Jerry and Dorothy stop, looking at Ray who has just shown
              shocking natural ability.  They are quiet for a moment,
              turning slowly to look at each other.  And then, not ready to
              deal with it, not even close to ready to deal with it, they
              say quickly to the boy:
 
                           JERRY                         DOROTHY
                   Come on, Ray.                 Ray, let's go.
 
              Happily Ray joins them as they walk to the car.  A family.
              Music.
 
                                                       FADE OUT
 
 
 
                                                 THE END
