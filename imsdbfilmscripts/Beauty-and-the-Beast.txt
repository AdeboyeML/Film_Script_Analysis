1   EXT. CASTLE GROUNDS - NIGHT                                1

    A MAGNIFICENT CASTLE. Resplendent, bespeaking great wealth and  
    power. The grounds and stonework immaculate.

                        NARRATOR (V.O.)
              Once upon a time in the hidden heart of
              France, a handsome young Prince lived in
              a beautiful castle...

    RACK FOCUS to a single RED ROSE clinging to a rose bush on a      
    stormy spring night. A WEATHERED HAND plucks the rose.            

                        NARRATOR (V.O.)
              Although he had everything his heart
              desired, the Prince was selfish and                     
              unkind.

2   INT. BALLROOM ENTRANCE - CASTLE - NIGHT                    2

    TIGHT ON THE PRINCE being groomed by his servants. (We do not
    see their faces.) A FRENCH MAID paints an exotic animal mask
    on the Prince's face with a feather brush. A TALL VALET drapes
    the Prince with an elaborately bejeweled coat.

                         NARRATOR (V.O.)
              He taxed the village to fill his
              castle with the most beautiful                          
              objects...

    The MAID dusts his wig with powder -

    - while a MAJORDOMO holds a POCKET WATCH, indicating that they  
    are running late.

              Master, it's time.                                      

    With a haughty wave, the Prince instructs his FOOTMAN to
    bring more light.

                        FOOTMAN                                       
              Oui, maître.                                            

    A CANDELABRA is lifted to the preening Prince as he looks at
    himself in an ornate HAND MIRROR.

              beautiful people.                                       
                                                                 2.


3   INT. BALLROOM - CASTLE - NIGHT                                   3

    The ornate room is filled with BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE from all              
    corners of the world, each on display for the Prince's                
    pleasure. A circle of eligible maidens bow their heads.               

    Seated in a throne chair dominated by a majestic COAT OF              
    ARMS, the Prince snaps his fingers impatiently at an ITALIAN          
    MAESTRO, who smiles, revealing comically rotten teeth.                

    The maestro sits at a harpsichord and motions to his wife, a
    LARGE DIVA holding a TINY BICHON FRISÉ. As the music begins,
    the Prince steps forward.

    The diva fills the room with a voice as big as her frame.
    The Prince performs a ROUNDELAY with several debutantes:

                        DIVA
              Oh how divine
              Glamour, music and magic combine
              See the maidens so anxious to shine
              Look for a sign that enhances
              Chances
              She'll be his special one

5   INT. BALLROOM - CASTLE - NIGHT                                   5

    The dance speeds up. The Prince connects momentarily with a           
    beautiful woman -- but quickly moves on when his eye catches
    someone even more dazzling:

                        DIVA
              What a display!
              What a breathtaking thrilling array
                  (coos to the dog)
              Every prince, every dog has his day
              Let us sing with passion, gusto
              Fit to bust - oh
              Not a care in the world

    KNOCK KNOCK. The Prince stops. Then a gust of wind blows open  
    the windows. Sconces flicker and go dark. The figure enters
    in silhouette, hobbling on a CANE.

    Furious, the Prince grabs a lit candelabra from the Footman.
    He rudely pushes through the crowd, sweeping people from his
    path. He crosses to the windows, finally revealing --

    AN OLD BEGGAR WOMAN shivering from the rain. She looks to the
    Prince with hope and offers him -- A RED ROSE.

                        NARRATOR (V.O.)
              Then, one night, an unexpected intruder                     
              arrived at the castle, seeking shelter
              from the bitter storm. As a gift, she
              offered the Prince a single rose.
                                                            3.


The PRINCE'S HAND waves her off.    The woman begs on her knees.
The Prince motions to the staff.

                    NARRATOR (V.O.)
          Repulsed by her haggard appearance, the
          Prince turned the woman away. But she                      
          warned him not to be deceived by
          appearances, for beauty is found within.

The majordomo and footman approach to usher her out.   The woman  
lowers her head as if to cry --

                    NARRATOR (V.O.)
          And when he dismissed her again, the old
          woman's outward appearance melted away
          to reveal...

Suddenly, the old woman's cape and hood cocoon.    AN ERUPTION OF
LIGHT as she transforms into...                                      

                    NARRATOR (V.O.)
          ...a beautiful Enchantress.

The wind picks up inside the room.   Frightened, the Prince          
falls to his knees.

                    NARRATOR (V.O.)
          The Prince tried to apologize but it
          was too late. For she had seen that
          there was no love in his heart.                            

As the Prince begs for mercy, his body begins to transform.          
His jewelry pops off. His clothing rips as he grows larger.

                    NARRATOR (V.O.)
          As punishment, she transformed him
          into a hideous beast...

The guests scream in horror and flee. But pushing his way            
through the crowd, A YOUNG BOY slips into the ballroom,
watching in wonder as -- the PRINCE'S SHADOW twists into the
SHADOW OF A HIDEOUS BEAST.

The boy's mother frantically follows him inside --                   

                     BOY'S MOTHER                                    
          Chip!   Chip! Oh my...                                     

-- just as the doors slam shut, leaving the staff, the               
entertainers and the dog trapped in the room.

     Years later, the enchanted castle stands isolated. The         
     property is surrounded by an ice hedge. The only sound is the
     grim winter wind. As we move closer:                           

                         NARRATOR (V.O.)
               As days bled into years, the Prince
               and his servants were forgotten by the
               world. For the Enchantress had erased
               all memory of them from the minds of                      
               the people they loved.                                    

7    EXT./INT. BEAST'S LAIR - WEST WING - CASTLE - NIGHT            7    

     At the highest window of the west wing, we see THE BEAST. The  
     ROSE, already wilting, floats before him. To protect it, the
     beast has covered it with a glass bell jar.                    

                         NARRATOR (V.O.)
               But the rose she had offered was truly
               an enchanted rose. If he could learn to
               love another and earn their love in
               return by the time the last petal fell,
               the spell would be broken. If not, he
               would be doomed to remain a beast for
               all time.

     TIGHT ON THE ROSE -- another petal drops.

                         NARRATOR (V.O.)
               As the years passed, he fell into
               despair and lost all hope. For who
               could ever learn to love a beast?

8    EXT. BELLE'S COTTAGE - MORNING                                 8

     The front door of a cozy cottage opens to reveal -- BELLE, a     
     pure beauty blessed with intelligent, fiercely inquisitive eyes.
     With book in hand, she takes a deep breath of morning air and
     gazes toward the church which peeks above the village rooftops.

                         BELLE
               Little town, it's a quiet village
               Every day like the one before
               Little town full of little people
               Waking up to say...

     Belle looks at the clock on the church counting to 8am.   Wait
     for it. 3. 2. 1.
                                                                5.

    On cue, the villagers begin their day. A HOUSEWIFE opens a           
    window, nods to a WOMAN shaking out a rug nearby. A BUTCHER          
    opens his shop, waves to a COBBLER moving past with his cart.        

                         VILLAGERS
              Bonjour.   Bonjour. Bonjour.   Bonjour.

    An old VAGRANT is the only one to notice Belle, smiling at her  
    as he's tossed inside a HOLDING TANK by two GENDARMES.          

                         VAGRANT
              Bonjour.

    Belle weaves between the villagers, making herself invisible.        
    She passes a harried BAKER, buys a baguette --                       

                        BELLE
              There goes the baker with his tray like

                        JEAN
              Good morning, Belle

    Jean scratches his head, trying to remember something.    He         
    searches his cart which is loaded with pottery.

                        BELLE
              Good morning, Monsieur Jean.   Have you
              lost something again?

                        JEAN
              I believe I have. Problem is, I can't
              remember what. Well, I'm sure it will
              come to me.

                        BELLE
              To return this book to Pere Robert.
              It's about two lovers in fair Verona.

                        JEAN

     Later -- Belle passes SCHOOL BOYS as they march into the school  
     house. Their heads turn in unison.

                         NASTY HEADMASTER
               Dazed and distracted, can't you tell?

     As the boys scramble into school, Belle steps on the stones
     over the duck pond -- revealing GIRLS forced into "woman's       
     work" chores, washing clothes in the circular laverie.
     They're surrounded by women kneading clothes on barrels.

     THE FISHMONGER pops up next to his wife, sending the would-be-

      Looking down on the village is GASTON, a dashingly handsome       
      war hero clad in a dazzling gold breastplate. The only thing      
      bigger than his muscles is his ego. Strapped on his saddle        
      is a musket and the spoils of his hunt: rabbit, fox, and
      fowl. Riding beside him is Gaston's long-suffering aide-de-       
      camp and devoted best friend LEFOU.

      Through his spyglass, Gaston spots Belle.

Gaston and LeFou ride through the village gates. Gaston

     With a smile, Belle points to the rotating barrel, which now

     Lightning. The sky flashes.     The wind picks up.   Worried,
     Maurice urges Philippe on.

               Philippe...? I only wish I recognized

     As the woods get darker, a WITHERED TREE that looks like an
     ELDERLY PERSON'S CANE is struck by lightning.                         

                            MAURICE (CONT'D)

     The tree splits in two, one half falling into the road,               
     revealing... a HIDDEN PATH. Philippe whinnies nervously.              

                         MAURICE (CONT'D)

     They leave the blocked road and head down the path.    Maurice        
     looks down to see a light snow cover on the ground.    Philippe       
     snorts.

23   EXT. ENCHANTED WOODS - EVENING                               23    

     We have entered another world. A light, whirling snow
     descends on Maurice, dusting his coat. The clippity-clop of
     hooves echo in stillness.                                          

     Suddenly, A WHITE WOLF roars out of the bushes, barely missing  
     them. Gaze darting, Maurice notices WHITE WOLVES running on an  
     icy ledge above him. The wolves keep pace, massing to overrun
     him.

                         MAURICE
               Go, Philippe! Hurry!

     Maurice urges his horse on, but his rickety cart starts to
     buckle. A HARNESS IS LOOSE.                                        

     The wolves leap in front of the cart, which comes undone,
     tipping over on its side. The chest of music boxes smashes open 
     on the ground. Maurice is launched up onto a ridge -- and finds 
     himself face-to-face with the snarling and scarred ALPHA WOLF.  

     Terrified, Maurice turns and begins sliding down the snowy ridge
                                                                     
     -- towards a trio of wolves waiting below.

     As Maurice drops from the ridge, Philippe appears beneath him --
                                                                     
     and Maurice lands on his back!

     Philippe rides. PAWS crush twigs -- SLAVERING JAWS -- EYES mad  
     with hunger -- a gleam of FANGS -- Philippe gallops. Maurice
     races toward the CASTLE ICE GATES -- which churn open as the    
     wolves draw near.

     Maurice and Philippe speed through the gates as the wolves skid
     to a stop, their HOWLS turning to YELPS OF FEAR.

24   EXT. CASTLE GROUNDS - EVENING                                24    

     Maurice stares in open-mouth awe at THE BEAST'S CASTLE. A grey  
     edifice seemingly growing out of stone and reaching to troubled  
     skies. It feels like a place hiding its face from the world.  

                         MAURICE

               Oh Philippe, you saved my life...                        
               They'll have to get their dinner                         
               somewhere else.                                          

     ANGLE ON MAURICE -- as he draws near the castle, he notices a      
     colonnade filled with WHITE ROSE BUSHES. Just beyond, he sees      
     the door to the STABLES swinging in the wind. A LAMP has been      
     lit inside. As if inviting a tired traveler.                       
                                                                     19.


     Maurice strokes Philippe's neck.

                  Water, fresh hay. Looks like you're                       
                  set, old friend. Rest here...                             

     Warily, Maurice peers out at the intimidating castle.

                            MAURICE (CONT'D)
                  While I pay my respects to our unwitting

     He leaves.    Philippe stares uneasily at a statue of a horse.

25   EXT. TERRACE - CASTLE - EVENING                                  25

     Cautiously, Maurice approaches the castle door. He gazes up at
     a row of TORCHES held by sculpted iron hands. The hands are so
     life-like, does a double-take.

     -- the DOOR OPENS with a creak.      Maurice peers in.

                             MAURICE
                  Hello?   Anyone home?

     Silence. Flashes of lightning illuminate a once-elegant space  
     now fallen into disrepair.

                            MAURICE (CONT'D)
                  Forgive me, I don't mean to intrude.   I
                  need shelter from the storm. Hello?

     Maurice puts his hat and coat on a COAT RACK at the entrance.
     Maurice turns, not seeing the coat rack shake the snow off.

     Maurice explores,     scanning the room and its FURNITURE --           
     TABLES, CHAIRS, A     FEATHER DUSTER. A MANTLE CLOCK AND               
     CANDELABRA SIT ON     A TABLE. As Maurice passes them, the             
     candelabra slowly     TURNS -- as if watching him. This is             
     LUMIÈRE, formerly     head footman to the Prince.                      

                            LUMIÈRE                                         
                  Must have lost his way in the woods...                    

     The candelabra continues craning -- while the mantle clock     
     beside it remains rigid. Meet COGSWORTH, every bit the stiff-  
     upper-lip majordomo.                                           

                            COGSWORTH

                  Shut up, you idiot.

      Hearing this, Maurice spins -- but sees only an ordinary           
      candelabra and clock on the table. Curious, he approaches,         
      leaning down to the clock...

                Mm... extraordinary.                                     

      He picks up the candelabra, inspecting it.

                This is beautiful...                                     

      An echo of eerie harpsichord music makes Maurice turn toward       
      the ballroom. He places the candelabra back down and exits.

      Maurice walks through a door into a dark cavernous room. His
      eyes adjust to the light and he realizes he's in a VAST        
      BALLROOM. Once the scene of joy, the ballroom knows only solemn
      decay. Suddenly --

      Maurice crosses to a crackling fire, speaking to his unseen        
      host.

                Wherever you are, I'm just going to                      
                warm myself by the fire...                               

      Maurice warms his frozen fingers, rubs his hands together to       
      spread the heat.

                          MAURICE (CONT'D)
                That's better. Oh, much better...                        

      As Maurice turns to warm his backside, he hears the clink of       
      silverware from an adjoining room.                                 

27    INT. DINING ROOM - CASTLE - NIGHT                            27

      Maurice enters to find a vast dining room dominated by a           
      BANQUET TABLE where a meal has been set out.                       

                          MAURICE                                        
                Oh, thank you!

     Famished, Maurice sits, tears off a hunk of bread and devours         
     it ravenously.                                                        

     As Maurice looks around for something to wash down the food, a  
     CUP OF TEA slides into his hand. Maurice calmly gives the cup a 
     double-take. Meet CHIP, an 8 year-old boy tea cup. He           
     whispers:

                         CHIP
               Mom said I wasn't supposed to move                          
               because it might be scary. Sorry.

     Maurice chews, smiles benevolently.                                   

                         MAURICE

28   INT. FOYER - CASTLE - NIGHT                                     28

     Like any sane person, Maurice backs toward the door.       He bows    
     and calls into the shadows...

                          MAURICE
               Thank you. Really, I cannot thank you
               enough for your hospitality...
                      (takes his coat and hat)
               ... And kindness.                                           

     A flash of lightning briefly illuminates a BEASTLY SHAPE on the
     staircase. At the next flash -- THE SHAPE IS GONE.

29   EXT. CASTLE GROUNDS - NIGHT                                     29

     Maurice rides Philippe away from the castle.        He notices the    
     colonnade filled with rose bushes again.                              

                          MAURICE                                          
               Roses!   Yes...                                             

     Maurice dismounts, checking to see that he hasn't been                
     followed from the castle. He strokes his nervous horse,               
     leaving him outside as he enters.                                     

                         MAURICE (CONT'D)

               promised Belle a rose, didn't I?      I                     
               think it's safe...                                          

     We catch GLIMPSES of A DARK SHAPE moving atop the colonnade.          
     A taloned PAW. A swishing TAIL.                                       

     Philippe snorts, sensing danger. Maurice spies a single               
     PERFECT WHITE ROSE among the others.                                  

     CLOSE on the beast's EYES.     Enraged.   Wounded.                    
                                                               22.


      Maurice reaches for it.                                            

                            MAURICE (CONT'D)

      Pricked by a thorn, he pulls his hand back -- then tries           
      again. He PICKS the rose -- only to hear a booming ROAR from       
      above.                                                             

      ANGLE ON MAURICE -- terrified as the dark shape leaps down         
      from the colonnade. Maurice drops the rose, stumbling and          
      falling as a DARK SHADOW is cast over him.                         

      Philippe breaks his harness, whinnies in terror and flees,         
      charging through the castle grounds and out the ice gates.

29A   EXT. VILLAGE PROMONTORY - DAY                            29A       

      A first whisper of dawn as Philippe bursts out of the forest.      
      He thunders down to the village.                                   

30    EXT. BELLE'S COTTAGE - DAY                                   30

      The sun is fresh on the horizon, and Belle is already up. A        
      whinny disturbs her. She looks up to find Philippe, thirsty
      and exhausted.                                                     

                            BELLE
                Philippe?

      Belle puts strokes the horse's neck as he drinks deeply from the

                          BELLE (CONT'D)
                What happened? Where is Papa?!                           

      Belle goes still. Notices Philippe's torn straps and tattered
      reins. In dread, her gaze darts to the woods.

                          BELLE (CONT'D)

31    EXT. WOODS - DAY                                             31

      Sunlight barely seeps through the thick branches lighting
      Belle's way as Philippe gallops past the FALLEN CANE TREE.

32    EXT. ENCHANTED WOODS - DAY                                   32

      Belle races through the enchanted woods, coming upon Maurice's  
      tipped over wagon. She sees the broken chest and scattered      
      music boxes.                                                    

      With a mix of apprehension and determination, Belle sets her
      jaw, and continues the gallop until the path brings her to...
                                                                23.


32A   EXT. TERRACE - CASTLE - DAY                                  32A    

      Belle dismounts Philippe. Finding a THICK BRANCH, she wields it
                                                                     
      like a club, then bravely crosses to the castle and enters.    

33    INT. FOYER - CASTLE - DAY                                    33

      Club held high, ready to defend herself, Belle cautiously eases
      the door open and peeks inside.

      The atmosphere of the castle presses in on Belle. Creepy DRAGON
                                                                     
      STATUES on the staircase seem like they're watching. Eerie     
      SHADOWS stretch down impossibly long hallways.                 

                          LUMIÈRE
                Look, Cogsworth. A beautiful girl.

                          COGSWORTH
                I can see it's a girl.    I lost my                       
                hands, not my eyes.                                       

                          LUMIÈRE
                But what if she is the one?   The one
                who will break the spell?                                 

      Belle reacts.   Quickly moves towards the voices --

                          BELLE
                Who said that? Who's there?

      Belle reaches the spot where she heard the voices. No one
      there. Only a clock and candelabra. Suddenly, a COUGH echoes  
      through the castle. Belle grabs the candelabra and climbs a   
      long staircase. The clock shudders with dread.                

34    INT. PRISON TOWER - CASTLE - DAY                             34

      Belle follows the cough up a labyrinth of stairs until she
      reaches the dark prison tower and a GRATED IRON DOOR.

                           BELLE
                Papa!?   Is that you?                                     

      Belle sees Maurice through a grate in the door.   He looks          
      terribly pale and sick, coughing.                                   

                           MAURICE (O.S.)
                Belle?   How did you find me!?

      Belle puts the candelabra down and clutches his hands.              

                          BELLE
                Oh, your hands are ice.   We need to get
                you home.                                                 
                                                        24.


                    MAURICE
          Belle, you must leave here at once.                 
          This castle is alive! Now go, before                
          he finds you!

          Who?!                                               

The beast roars. Belle spins quickly, swinging her club to    
strike, but the figure jumps onto another staircase. Belle
searches the shadows. The voice circles her.

                    BELLE (CONT'D)
          Who's there? Who are you?

                    THE BEAST (O.S.)

                    THE BEAST (O.S.)
          HE STOLE A ROSE.                                    

In Belle's wide eyes, we see her guilt.                       

                    BELLE
          I asked for the rose.   Punish me, not              
          him!                                                

                    MAURICE
          No, he means forever. Apparently                    
          that's what happens around here when                
          you pick a flower.                                  

                    BELLE
          A life sentence for a rose?

                    THE BEAST
          I received eternal damnation for one.
          I'm merely locking him away. Now... do              
          you still wish to take your father's
          place?

                    BELLE
          Come into the light.

The figure remains still. Belle grabs hold of Lumiere and     
thrusts the candle forward, illuminating a HIDEOUS HORNED     
FACE. Belle's eyes go wide as she clearly sees THE BEAST.
The only part of him that seems human are his eyes. BLUE.
                                                              25.


     DEEP. SOULFUL.   And flicked with pain when he sees Belle's        
     revulsion.

     Maurice falls into a terrible coughing fit.                        

                         BELLE

               Forever can spare a minute!

     Intrigued by her defiance, the beast moves toward her, reaching
     out with his massive paw. Belle closes her eyes, bracing
     herself for his retaliation. Instead, she hears -- CLANG.

     Belle opens her eyes to find herself eye to eye with the beast's
     chest. He has reached high above her head to pull down an iron
     lever, unlocking the door.

     With that, she pivots and swings her father through the door
     just as the beast slams it shut. Maurice trips to the ground,
     giving the beast a second to turn to Belle. They lock eyes.

     Through the latticework, Belle sees the beast and her father         
     disappear down the corridor. She rushes to the window and            
     watches the beast carry her father down the spiral staircase

     Once she is alone, Belle cannot help herself.      She slumps to

Belle wipes her tears and stands.    She grabs a small stool,
ready to strike.

Belle bounds out of the cell, raising the stool to hit a grown

Like seeing a mouse, Belle bashes the candelabra. It grunts as
it clatters on the stone floor. The candles extinguished.

WHOOSH -- the first candle relights. WHOOSH -- the second.      
Illuminated by the two arm candles, Belle makes out EYES and a
rudimentary "FACE" in the design.

               Come here, Froufrou. Come help mama!                     

     Froufrou tugs at the fabric, helping Garderobe complete the        
     outfit -- which is garish and too too much, all wrong for          
     Belle.

               Mm.   Subtle. Understated.    I love it!                 

     With a deep bow and a whistle for Froufrou, Lumière drags     
     Cogsworth out. Plumette and Froufrou follow. Garderobe calls  
     out after her beloved dog.

                         GARDEROBE
               Froufrou, send my love to the maestro!

     The door closes. Belle is alone. Garderobe instantly falls         
     asleep with a big SNORE. Belle has one beat of... where the        
     hell am I? She ducks down, then crawls out from underneath
     the enormous dress, which remains standing.

     Belle looks around the room with one thing in mind: escape.
     She quickly moves to the window. Opens it. She looks down          
     at the 100 foot drop leading to the grounds.                       

     Belle turns back to the room, and gazes at the dress.   An         
     idea taking shape.

     A LAMPLIGHTER is hard at work outside as we hear fiddle music

44   INT. COUNTRY INN - NIGHT                                     44

     Amidst the animal heads, antlers, and drunken villagers, there
     is an even sadder sight -- GASTON. He drowns his sorrows in ale 
     while LEFOU listens.

                         GASTON
               Picture it, LeFou -- a rustic cabin.
               My latest kill roasting on the fire.
               Adorable children running around us
               while my love rubs my tired feet. But                    
               what does Belle say? "I will never                       
               marry you, Gaston."                                      

                         LEFOU
               You know, there are other girls.                         

     The village lasses perk up.   "Yes!   There are other girls!"
                                                         32.


                    GASTON
          A great hunter doesn't waste his time on
          rabbits.

The lasses deflate. "Awww!" LeFou decides it's time to cheer
up his best friend/boss. Thus begins "GASTON."

                    LEFOU
          Gosh it disturbs me to see you
          Gaston looking so down in the dumps
          Every guy here'd love to be you Gaston
          Even when taking your lumps
          There's no man in town as admired as you
          You're everyone's fa-vor-ite guy
          Everyone's awed and inspired by you
          And it's not very hard to see why

LeFou gives a nod (and a large tip) to the FIDDLE PLAYER in the  
corner, who nods back, and begins to play...

                    LEFOU (CONT'D)
          No one's slick as Gaston
          No one's quick as Gaston
          No one's neck's as incredibly thick as
          Gaston
          For there's no man in town half as manly
          Perfect, a pure paragon!
          You can ask any Tom, Dick or Stanley
          And they'll tell you whose team they
          prefer to be on!

LeFou hops onto the bar, squeezing himself between TOM, DICK,    
and STANLEY.                                                     

                    TOM/DICK/STANLEY
          Who plays darts like Gaston?
          Who breaks hearts like Gaston?

                    LEFOU
          Who's much more than the sum of his
          parts like Gaston?

                     GASTON

          As a specimen, yes, I'm intimidating

LeFou hails a BARMAID and buys everyone a round of drinks.       
The villagers raise their mugs and cheer.                        

                    LEFOU/VILLAGERS
          My what a guy, that Gaston!

Gaston stands, and clasps LeFou in gratitude...                  

                    GASTON
          I needed encouragement; thank you, LeFou
                                                           33.


                    LEFOU
          Well, there's no one as easy to bolster
          as you!

... only to find himself in an uncomfortably tight hug.

          Yep.                                                   

                    VILLAGERS                                    
          No one fights like Gaston
          Douses lights like Gaston!

                    LEFOU
          In a wrestling match nobody bites like
          Gaston!

LeFou moves his shirt up his arm to show an old wrestling wound -
a nice teeth impression courtesy of Gaston. The villagers gasp. 

                    GASTON                                       
          When I hunt, I sneak up with my quiver
          And beasts of the field say a prayer
          First I carefully aim for the liver
          Then I shoot from behind!

Gaston leaps onto the bar, and is handed a huge blunderbuss,     
with which he mimes shooting LeFou.                              

                    LEFOU
          Is that fair?

                    GASTON
          I don't care

And Gaston fires the rifle into the ceiling!   Plaster rains     
down.

          Gaston

                    GASTON
          I'M ESPECIALLY GOOD AT EXPECTORATING!

Gaston spits a big gloppy mess into a spittoon: bullseye!   Then,
he moves around the inn, holding court.

                    VILLAGERS
          Ten points for Gaston!
                                                          34.

          When I was a lad I ate four dozen eggs

On one shoulder, Gaston lifts a pretty VILLAGE GIRL.   On the     
other, he lifts LeFou.

          And now that I'm grown I eat five dozen
          eggs
          So I'm roughly the size of a barge!

The crowd hollers. Gaston jumps on a long table. The table's  
height plus his massive frame make him seem 10 feet tall.     

He engages in a dance-break sword-fight with several VILLAGE      
MEN, besting them all, until he's perfectly positioned beneath   a

          Who can make up these endless

Gaston tromps on the table.   He arrives at his WALL OF ANIMAL    
HEADS and ANTLERS.

                    GASTON (CONT'D)
          I use antlers in all of my decorating!

          Who's that hero next door?
          Who's a super success?
          Don't you know? Can't you guess?
          Ask his fans and his five hangers-on
          There's just one guy in town
          Who's got all of it down...

                    LEFOU
          And his name's `G-A-S-T... ' Uh, I

The villagers cheer as Gaston returns to his seat.   Gaston slaps
                                                                 
LeFou on the shoulder, genuinely moved.

          Ah LeFou, you're the best. How is it

     The staff is excited as they scramble to get ready for dinner.
     CHIP, the 8 year-old tea cup, rides his saucer around like a
     skateboard. He circles his teapot mother MRS. POTTS, a no-
     nonsense yet loving governess.

     But Chip doesn't slow down. Before Mrs. Potts can chase,
     CUISINIÈR, the frustrated French chef-turned-oven, pours hot

     The beast enters the dining room and sits at one end of a
     long dining table. He looks at his place setting, surprised
     to find flatware and crystal. Confused, he looks up.

     THE BEAST'S POV rises to find another place setting at the
     other end of the long table. When he notices the romantic
     candles, he swats his own place setting off the table in
     anger.

A fuming beast storms in, and looks down at the assembled

          Master, I can assure you that I had no
          part in this hopeless plan. Preparing                   
          a dinner, designing a gown for her,

          That is true. But if the girl is the                    
          one who can break the spell, maybe you
          can start by using dinner to charm her.

          She's the daughter of a common thief.

     It's a loaded statement. The staff cringes, ready for his
     retaliation. Instead, a grunt, and then --

52   INT. BEAST'S LAIR - WEST WING - CASTLE - NIGHT               52

     Fuming, the beast returns to his lair -- a chamber of shredded
     furniture and walls ruined in rage. He paces, muttering. He  
     grabs a decaying HAND MIRROR.                                   

                         THE BEAST
               Show me the girl.

     The mirror lights up and gives him a view of Belle at the          
     bedroom door. She turns, slides down the wall, and curls her       
     knees up to her. A look of dread on her face.                      

     Her fear crushes the beast. The mirror magic fades, and he is
     left with his own reflection and self-loathing. He lowers the
     mirror to reveal the glass jar by the open window.

     In the jar, the ENCHANTED ROSE hangs in mid-air. The rose is
     wilting. Most of its petals have fallen. Rage evaporating,
     replaced by shame, the beast lowers his head...

     ... as ONE MORE PETAL DROPS.

     The image moves inside the jar. We see the beast through the
     glass as he leans down, peering in at the petal as it reaches
     the bottom and shrivels. As it does, we hear a far off RUMBLE,  
     as if the foundation of the castle is trembling.

INT. KITCHEN - CASTLE - NIGHT

The door opens.   Lumière races in to the excited staff.

          everyone, tout de suite!                                

Cogsworth waddles in after him.   Plumette flutters nervously.    

                    COGSWORTH
          No, you don't! If the master finds out
          you violated his orders and fed her, he
          will blame me.

Lumiere jumps up onto the sink, navigating sudsy dishes as        
CHAPEAU scrubs them.

          Yes, I will make sure of it. But did                    
          you see her stand up to him? I am
          telling you, this girl is the one.
          They must fall in love if we are to be
          human again, and they can't fall in
          love if she stays in her room.
              (looks at a smudged dish)
          Eh, Chapeau, you missed a spot!                         

Lumière tosses the dish back in the sink, skipping onto a         
passing tea trolley. Cogsworth climbs up in pursuit.              

                    COGSWORTH

57   INT. DINING ROOM - CASTLE - MOMENTS LATER                  57

     To Cogsworth's horror, Lumière guides an ambulatory HARPSICHORD  
     into the room. This is CADENZA, our neurotic Italian maestro.

     Mrs. Potts leads Belle to the end of the long dining table.

     Lumière LEAPS onto the table. Floating at a high window,         
     Plummette uses a silver platter to turn a shaft of moonlight     
     into a SPOTLIGHT. As Lumière begins "BE OUR GUEST."              
                                                            45.

          we welcome you tonight. And now, we
          invite you to relax.

Belle sits down in a chair, which moves in, bringing her
closer to the table. Lumière motions up to Plumette to            
steady her shaky spotlight.

          Let us pull up a chair... as the dining
          room proudly presents...

Cadenza plays a dramatic scale as a table cloth UNFURLS, and   
Lumière jumps up and LANDS in a pose. Cadenza ends his scale on
the wrong note. Lumière shoots him a look, Cadenza plays the
right note, and Lumière turns to Belle and smiles.

The napkins on the place settings rise up and twirl.   Chapeau
offers Belle a napkin.

          Put our service to the test
          Tie your napkin `round your neck, cherie

Spinning quickly, Chapeau presents the following to Belle:

The hors d'oeuvres plates go off, leaving the dinner dishes to
levitate and spin.

Cogsworth shushes Lumière, and Lumière jabs him back.   One by    
one the kitchen doors swing open, presenting:

          Beef ragout, cheese souffle,
          Pie and pudding en flambé!

The fish pie explodes! A piece of cod hits Cogsworth in the       
face, knocking him over.

Flute glasses fill up with champagne and then break into a Bob
Fosse homage. Belle grabs a glass, but Lumière snatches it
before she sips.

                    LUMIÈRE (CONT'D)
          You're alone and you're scared

Lumière coaxes the flatware to its feet.

          No one's gloomy or complaining

The flatware hold out a napkin, into which Lumière jumps, like a

Lumière falls and lands back in the middle of the champagne
flutes. They rise up around him.

Martha Graham inspired solo.

          Life is so unnerving

Belle reaches again for food but is stopped by Lumière's
melodramatic histrionics. He wraps himself in a napkin for
the full Martha Graham effect.

                    LUMIÈRE (CONT'D)
          He's not whole
          Without a soul to wait upon

Lumière does a `tragic walk' down the table. Reaching the end,
he slides down to the floor on the tablecloth, then gathers it
around his neck and continues on.

Belle tries to stab a bite as the food moves past her, as if on
a conveyer belt. Sliding past her, Cogsworth wobbles.

On the floor, snow swirls around Lumière. We pull out to see       
several "ETTES" flinging salt at him to create the effect.

     She ascents to the top of a tiered, circular pastry table, as     
     napkins twirl around her. Desserts appear and circle Mrs.         
     Potts. Then tea cups enter on the outer circle, moving in
     the opposite direction.

     From overhead, a la Busby Berkeley, we reveal desserts, teacups,
     napkins, the floor, everything circling in opposing directions.
     Mrs. Potts descends, jumping onto her tea trolley -- and notices 
     a smudge of icing on Chip.

                                                              49.


     Plumette and her "Ettes" descend on a chandelier, which is
     lowered by Lumière. They dance; a Beyoncé homage.

                         ALL
               Be our guest! Be our guest!
               Our command is your request!
               It's years since we had anybody
               Here and we're obsessed!

     Lumière ties the chandelier rope around Cogsworth, who falls
     over, causing the light to spin. Plumette dives into a massive
     punch bowl, leading her "Ettes" into an Esther Williams moment.

                         ALL (CONT'D)
               With your meal, with your ease,
               Yes indeed, we aim to please

     Splashes from the punch bowl launch us into a "Singin' in the      
     Rain" moment, with Lumière dancing under the fountain. The         
     grand finale is pure Bollywood, punctuated by explosions of
     candy-colored powders.

                         ALL (CONT'D)
               While the candlelight's still glowing,
               Let us help you, we'll keep going --
               Course by... COURSE! One by one!
               Til you shout "Enough, I'm done!"
               Then we'll sing you off to sleep as you
               digest
               Tonight you'll prop your feet up
               But for now let's eat up...
               Be our guest! Be our guest!
               Be our guest! Please! Be our guest!!

     As the table clears itself, whooshing back into the kitchen,       
     Lumière whirls toward Belle, finally presenting her with --        

                           LUMIÈRE
               Pudding?!

     Overwhelmed, she laughs.                                           


60   INT. FOYER - CASTLE - NIGHT                                  60    

     Mrs. Potts (on her trolley cart) escorts Belle from the dining  
     room.                                                           

                         BELLE                                          
               Surely you're as trapped here as I am.                   
               Don't you ever want to escape?                           

                         MRS. POTTS                                     
               The master's not as terrible as he                       
               appears. Somewhere deep in his soul,                     
               there's a prince of a fellow, just                       
               waiting to be set free.                                  
                                                               50.


     Belle takes this in, a valuable piece of the puzzle.   She         
     looks up at the massive staircase.                                 

                         BELLE                                          
               Lumiere mentioned something about the                    
               West Wing...                                             

                         MRS. POTTS                                     
               Never you mind about that.   Off to bed                  
               with you, poppet.                                        

                         BELLE                                          
               Good night.                                              

                         MRS. POTTS                                     
               Nighty-night. Straight to bed!                           

     Mrs. Potts moves off as Belle climbs the stairs toward her         
     room. At the top, she hurries up the staircase leading to          
     the west wing.                                                     

63   INT. STAIRCASE - WEST WING - CASTLE - NIGHT                  63

     Belle sticks to the shadows.   She walks up to a massive wooden
     door -- slightly ajar.

64   INT. BEAST'S LAIR - WEST WING - CASTLE - NIGHT               64

     Furniture lies in rubble, curtains are shredded -- evidence of
     the beast's temper. Wary, Belle investigates when --

     SHE GLIMPSES EYES PEERING AT HER OFF TO THE SIDE.

     With a start, Belle wheels to find -- the eyes belong to a royal
     portrait. The subject seems to be a TEENAGE BOY but his face
     has been SLASHED BEYOND RECOGNITION.

     Only the eyes survived. Bright blue. Engaging. Resembling the
     eyes of THE BEAST. She realizes that this is the "prince of a  
     fellow" Mrs. Potts was referring to.                           

     Belle leans in to study the painting. A ROYAL FAMILY stands by  
     the castle. The FATHER's image has been slashed. The QUEEN
     remains pristine. Kind. Beautiful.

     Belle moves past a large four-poster bed, its faded coverlet       
     gray with dust, like no one has slept in it for years. On          
     the floor, she sees a makeshift bed made of straw, torn bits       
     of fabric and crumpled blankets: the resting place of a            
     nocturnal carnivore.                                               

     Belle turns and sees the glow coming from the GLASS JAR by an
     open window leading to the balcony. Inside the jar -- THE
     ENCHANTED ROSE.

     Mesmerized, Belle approaches the rose. She lifts the jar,
     leaving the rose unprotected. She reaches out to touch the
     rose. A shadow cuts across Belle's face.
                                                                    51.


                             THE BEAST
                  WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE!?    WHAT DID YOU
                  DO TO IT!?

        The beast bears down on Belle, backing her up.   She puts down
        the bell jar.

                               BELLE
                  Nothing.

                            THE BEAST
                  DO YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU COULD HAVE
                  DONE!? YOU COULD HAVE DAMNED US ALL!
                  GET OUT! GO!                                             

        Belle runs.   The beast turns and covers the rose, panicked and  
        protective.

        Lumière and Cogsworth play chess on an upper landing, with         
        Froufrou resting between them.

        Cogsworth jumps onto the chess board as Lumiere hops to the        
        floor.

        Belle barrels down the main staircase, Froufrou in close           
        pursuit.                                                           

        Mrs. Potts enters from the kitchen, wearing a tea cosy.

     At the top of the stairs, Cogsworth sounds a whistle.     In quick  
     cuts, WINDOWS drop and SHUTTERS close.

     Belle hits the bottom of the grand staircase and runs towards
     the door -- only to watch it bolt itself locked.

                           MRS. POTTS (CONT'D)

     Froufrou runs in front of Belle to block her exit, and growls.

               Who's a good dog?                                          

     Then suddenly, his growls turn to playful yaps, as he stands         
     on his hind legs and pants playfully.

                         MRS. POTTS

     Froufrou spins and scrambles outside, scooting through the           
     low postern door within the great front door. In his                 
     excitement, he's provided Belle with an escape!                      

     Belle snatches her cloak from a bewildered Chapeau, and              
     shimmies out through this same `doggie door.'

     HOWL. Philippe's hooves hit the snowy landscape.   Belle races
     through the woods. She looks back to see if the beast followed
     her. She only sees a glimpse of the castle. She thinks she has
     escaped. Surely, she has escaped.

     WOLVES HOWL NEARBY.

     ANGLE ON PHILIPPE'S MUDDY HOOFPRINT -- a WOLF'S PAW smashes down
     over the print -- the wolf howls --
                                                             53.


ANGLE ON BELLE -- out of the corner of her eye, she sees SHAPES
OF A DOZEN WHITE WOLVES flitting through the trees, closing in
on her.

Belle forges on -- the wolves are not bothering to hide anymore,
they've emerged from the trees to take down their prey --
closing in fast --

-- Belle pushes through the undergrowth to find she has reached  
a FROZEN POND. Philippe doesn't hesitate. He gallops onto the  
ice, and across the pond. The sound of ice CRACKING under his  
hooves is deep and low. And increasing.                          

Philippe's hooves slide on the ice.   The wolves close in.         

Philippe makes it across the pond onto land.   But before          
Belle can feel any relief --                                       

A WOLF'S JAWS snap at Philippe's thigh. Then another. The          
horse bucks wildly -- causing Belle to makes a controlled          
leap onto a snow bank. She seizes a thick branch and wields        
it as a club -- as the wolves surround her, jaws slavering --

Belle swings her club as one wolf lunges at her, its bared         
teeth like razors. She beats it away. She turns to confront        
another -- it bites the branch clean out of her hands.             

Belle turns, looks up -- on a rock promontory, the scarred         
ALPHA WOLF is about to take a diving leap onto her. It             
jumps, and she flinches -- but just as the wolf is about to        
makes its horrible landing --

THE BEAST APPEARS --

-- and catches it in mid-air! With supernatural force, the         
beast hurls the wolf across the frozen pond, howling!              

All the wolves dive on the beast at once, tearing shreds from      
his cloak. He strikes at them -- wolves scurry, yelping --         

The oversize ALPHA WOLF climbs onto the beast's back, goes         
for his neck. The beast slams together the wolves on his           
arms, dropping them -- then reaches back and seizes the            
Alpha. WOLF and BEAST snarl inches from each other -- the          
beast squeezes --                                                  

Then hurls the Alpha into a stone ledge -- CRACK -- knocking him
out. The remaining pack retreats in panic, their yelps echoing
through the trees.

TIGHT ON BELLE -- watching as the beast whimpers in pain. His
shoulders slump. He collapses in the snow. This is her chance.
Belle could run. She looks past Philippe, to the woods -- to  
freedom. But then turns back, and slowly approaches the wounded
                                                               
beast.                                                         

Belle covers the beast with her blanket.   He stirs.   One eye

      sunrise. As his vision adjusts, the silhouetted figure by

      Belle notices that she's walking alone.   She turns back, sees

      As she follows his gaze, we reveal a splendidly desolate           
      landscape. The very thing Belle has just described, now

      Belle smiles, pleased that for a moment at least he's become

     Belle meets the beast's eyes.   Both suddenly aware of hidden

     In the fresh snow, Belle brushes Philippe's coat. The beast     
     looks at Belle -- she nods -- and he pets the horse. Philippe  
     reacts skittishly, causing the beast to withdraw. Belle takes  
     his hand and places it on Philippe. Then, as she turns away --  

                         BELLE
               There's something sweet and almost

     Suddenly, a snowball hits the beast.   He turns to see Belle

     The beast builds a huge snowball, and hurls it at Belle. It      
     knocks her clean off her feet and into the snow. Off the

     Belle reads at her end of the long dining table. She looks up
     and sees the beast looking at her. "May I?" She nods, goes     
     back to her book. As he walks the length of the table:         
                          THE BEAST
               She glanced this way
               I thought I saw

               No, it can't be

               But then she's never looked at me that
               way before

     The beast sits. He grabs his bowl and slurps down the soup,      
     then catches himself as he sees Belle watching him.
                                                                64.


     After a moment, she picks up her bowl and drinks the soup the
     same way. The beast smiles. They loudly slurp and laugh           
     together.

     Plumette and several Ettes remove dust bags from the

     She scrubs a dirty window, causing a beam of sunlight to          
     strike Cadenza. Meanwhile Chapeau mops the floor, cleaning        
     off years of grime, revealing the shiny marble underneath.

     handing them to the beast. The staff watches from the corner.

     The beast nods gratefully, and the wizened GLOBE on the tabletop 
     nods back. As the staff moves away:

               Oh, I love Paris. What would you like
               to see first? Notre Dame? The Champs-
               Elysées? No? Too touristy?                                 

     He turns to find Belle silent.   Her eyes brimming with tears.       

                         BELLE
               It's so much smaller than I imagined.

     The beast watches Belle walk through her childhood home...           
     the artist's garret that Maurice recreated in his signature          
     music box. Abandoned years ago, the room is crumbling.               
     Belle finds the remains of her father's easel. A tarnished
     wall mirror. Her own broken crib.

          Now I see it's empty and abandoned

          Knowing that the Paris of my childhood

Belle notices something tucked into a corner of the crib.          
She pries it loose. It is a BABY'S RATTLE carved into the          
shape of a rose. The beast focuses on it.

As she speaks, the beast notices something on a chair.   The       
dark, pointed mask of a plague doctor. He looks up.                

                      THE BEAST
          Plague.

The revelation lands on Belle's face.   She looks around.

IN QUICK TIGHT SHOTS ---                                           

Belle glimpses what must have happened. A DOCTOR stands in         
the doorway, his face covered by the mask.                         

                    DOCTOR

A bag is hastily packed, Belle's YOUNGER FATHER (barely seen)      
taking only what is necessary. He stops to gaze at Belle's         
MOTHER, who lies on her deathbed, surrounded by medicines.

She closes her eyes, turns away.                                   

Maurice picks up the baby... who drops her beloved rose-           
shaped rattle. Belle's mother touches it to her lips as            
husband and child disappear.

     LeFou realizes he shouldn't be happy and tamps down his

     assesses the situation.

                         MAURICE
               No! You tried to kill me!    You left

               Maurice, it's one thing to rave about

Gaston's argument lands.    The gentle Maurice feels the room    
slipping away from him.

Maurice lunges at Gaston -- who catches his flying fist, easily

     Gaston signals to Tom, Dick, and Stanley -- and Maurice turns to
     see them block the exit. Gaston places his large hand on
     Maurice's shoulder -- and squeezes. Maurice winces.

     The staff retreats.    As "EVERMORE" begins, the beast pulls on    
     a dark cape.

     He steps onto the balcony of his lair. From his POV, we see        
     Belle mounting Philippe on the castle grounds below.

                         THE BEAST
               I'll never shake away the pain

     Belle sets off and the beast begins to climb the castle
     turrets.

     The beast climbs higher and higher, to keep Belle in sight as      
     she gets further and further away.

                         THE BEAST (CONT'D)

     The beast climbs, Belle riding, until he reaches the highest
     turret of the castle.

     The beast stands at the edge of the turret as Belle finally        
     disappears through the castle gates.                               

96   EXT. VILLAGE OF VILLENEUVE - SQUARE - NIGHT                  96    

     A horse-drawn asylum wagon thunders into the square where
     Maurice is surrounded by taunting villagers. The eerie
     driver, MONSIEUR D'ARQUE, steps out as Tom, Dick and Stanley
     throw Maurice into his cage on wheels. Villagers approach
     the wagon like 18th century rubberneckers.                         

     Gaston leans into the wagon. The gathering crowd is just loud
     enough to mask a private plea to Maurice...

                         GASTON
               Have you ever seen the inside of a mad
               house, Maurice? You wouldn't last a
               week. Just give me your daughter's                       
               hand, and I'll set you free.

                         MAURICE                                        
               Never.                                                   

     Gaston clenches his jaw and locks the door with a CLANK.           

                         GASTON
               Take him away!

     The wagon begins to move. The rubberneckers watch the wagon        
     until they are silenced by a loud...

                         BELLE (O.S.)
               STOP!

     Belle's voice cuts through the crowd.   They turn and gape at --  

     BELLE, DAZZLING, IN HER EVENING GOWN.

     The crowd parts before her as she dismounts Philippe and
     moves to the wagon. They whisper as she passes --
                                                            79.


                    VILLAGERS
          "Belle..." "Where did she come from?"
          "Is that Belle..." "Look at that
          dress..."

Gaston stares, slack-jawed, unable to believe his eyes. We
linger on the jealous village lasses, the puzzled Jean, the
confused LeFou, the foul-tempered Clothilde, the bewildered
Pere Robert, and in the shadows... Agathe.                        

Belle fearlessly strides right in front of the wagon. The
horses jump up, startled. Belle runs to the locked door.

                     MAURICE
          Belle?   I thought I'd lost you!                        

Belle sees her father injured on the floor of the wagon.

                    BELLE
          Open this door! He's hurt!

Monsieur d'Arque climbs down to calm her.                         

                    MONSIEUR D'ARQUE
          I'm afraid we can't do that, miss.   But
          we'll take very good care of him.                       

                    BELLE
          My father's not crazy!   Gaston...
          Tell him!

                    GASTON
          Belle, you know how loyal I am to your
          family, but your father has been making
          some unbelievable claims.

                    JEAN
          It's true, Belle. He's been raving
          about a beast in a castle.

                    BELLE
          I have just come from the castle and                    
          there is a beast!                                       

                    GASTON
          We all admire your devotion to your
          father, but you'd say anything to free
          him. Your word is hardly proof.

Belle pulls out the magic mirror from her sash.

                    BELLE
          You want proof? SHOW ME THE BEAST!                      

In the mirror, the beast sits slumped against a turret wall.      
The villagers gasp. Gaston's face registers shock.                
                                                           80.


                    BELLE (CONT'D)
          There is your proof!

                    GASTON
          This is sorcery!

Gaston snatches the mirror from Belle and holds it up to the
villagers.

                     GASTON (CONT'D)
          Look at this beast. Look at his fangs,                  
          his claws.                                              

The villagers recoil in fright.                                   

                    BELLE
          No, don't be afraid.    He is gentle and
          kind.

                    GASTON
          The monster has put her under a spell!                  
          If I didn't know better, I'd say she
          even cared for him.                                     

                    BELLE
          He's not a monster, Gaston. You are.                    
              (appeals to everyone)                               
          The beast would never hurt anyone.                      

                    GASTON
          I have heard of the effects of dark                     
          magic, but never seen it with my own                    
          eyes before! This is a threat to our                    
          very existence!                                         

Raucous cries of "Gaston Gaston Gaston!" rise.    Gaston holds    
the mirror up.

          We can't have her running off to warn                   
          the beast. Lock her up too.                             

Tom, Dick and Stanley strong-arm Belle into the wagon with        
her father.

Gaston hops onto the back of the wagon and addresses the          
crowd. The "MOB SONG" begins as we move through the               
frightened villagers --                                           

                     GASTON (CONT'D)

                    GASTON
          So it's time to take some action, boys
          It's time to follow me!

Gaston grabs a TORCH from a villager and tosses it into a barrel
of pitch. Flames rise to the sky.                               

                    GASTON (CONT'D)
          Through the mist, through the wood
          Through the darkness and the shadows
          It's a nightmare but it's one exciting
          ride

Gaston lights Clothilde's torch, then clasps the shoulder of      
Monsieur d'Arque, who watches helplessly as his asylum wagon      
horses are commandeered by the mob.                               

                     GASTON (CONT'D)

          At the drawbridge of a castle
          And there's something truly terrible
          inside
          It's a beast, he's got fangs razor
          sharp ones
          Massive paws, killer claws for the
          feast
          Hear him roar, see him foam
          But we're not coming home
          `Til he's dead, good and dead...

Some villagers seize shovels, pitchforks, axes. Some light        
torches in the pitch. Others wrench a boar's head PIKE STAFF      
from outside the country inn. Pere Robert tries to calm the       
frenzy but the force of the mob pushes him back.                  
                                                                 82.

      It's EMPTY. Met by eerie silence, Gaston and the mob cautiously
      enter. The door barely hangs on its hinges.

      Villagers hold up torches. The flickering light reveals
      FURNITURE. Chairs. A coat rack. A feather duster. A
      candelabra. A tea pot and teacup. A harpsichord.

      Gaston looks into the mirror. ANGLE ON LeFou -- he notices          
      Mrs. Potts. Brings his torch close to study her.

      ANGLE ON THE MOB -- among them, Jean the potter stares at the
      eerie castle foyer --

      LeFou jumps back. ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE as the furniture comes  
      alive. Chairs kick the shins of several villagers. Plumette
      feathers villagers' faces furiously, causing them to have
      sneezing fits. As other villagers funnel in, the "Lend-a-Hand"
      lights outside the door bonk several of them on the head.
      They're alive after all.

      Chapeau spins Gaston around and is about to land a blow when       
      GASTON GRABS LEFOU and puts him in the line of fire. LeFou         
      becomes a human punching bag as Cadenza approaches and rears

      Monsieur d'Arque paces in the square, when he notices the          
      door to the asylum wagon is ajar. He runs to the wagon and         
      flings open the doors, only to find it empty. D'Arque slams        
      the doors shut -- and there's Maurice, smiling beside him.

      senses his presence, turns. They lock eyes. Gaston cocks             
      his pistol.                                                          

                            GASTON
                  Hello, beast. I am Gaston.    Belle sent
                  me.

130   INT. TURRET STAIRCASE - CASTLE - NIGHT                        130

      Belle races up the stairs to the turret.

131   EXT. HIGHEST TURRET - CASTLE - NIGHT                          131

      With no hope left, the beast turns away from Gaston, whose           
      finger tightens on the trigger.                                      

                            GASTON                                         
                  Were you in love with her? Did you                       
                  honestly think she'd want you?                           

      He fires.   The beast drops over the edge.

      On the turret below, his claws make contact with the slanted
      rooftop and break his fall. He hugs the rooftop, heaving.

      Gaston looks down over the edge of the turret. He pulls his          
      crossbow and reaches back over his shoulder to draw an arrow         
      from his quiver -- but there's nothing there.                        

      Gaston spins to see Belle, and his arrows gripped in her             
      hands.                                                               

                            GASTON (CONT'D)                                
                  Belle?                                                   
                                                                92.


                          BELLE                                          
                Where is he?!                                            

      With that, Belle snaps Gaston's arrows over her knee, and          
      tosses them away. Gaston grabs her arm.                            

                          GASTON
                When we return to the village, you will
                marry me, and the beast's head will hang
                on our wall!

                          BELLE
                NEVER.

      She pulls away -- and uses this pivot to grab the barrel of
      Gaston's pistol. They struggle.                                    

      With Gaston on the back foot for a split second, Belle yanks the
                                                                      
      pistol hard. Gaston, not letting go, swings with it, and
      seeking balance on a loose stone, he drops off the side of the
      turret!

      Gaston's reflexes are quick. He lets go of the pistol, grabbing
                                                                     
      a gargoyle and swinging himself down through a window of the
      turret. He lands on the spiral staircase.

      Gaston's pistol, in the meantime, clatters down, coming to rest  
      on the landing of a stone footbridge below.

132   EXT. CASTLE - VARIOUS TURRETS - NIGHT                       132

      Wounded, the beast climbs around the lower turret. All around  
      him, turrets quaver and crack. The castle is imploding.        

                          GASTON (O.S.)                                  
                I'm coming for you, beast!                               

      Gaston continues down until he reaches the bottom of the           
      spiral staircase. He drops to a window box below, and jumps        
      sideways onto another.                                             

      The beast makes a second leap, onto another parapet.   Tiles       
      slide away beneath him as he scrambles to hang on.                 

      Belle reaches the landing at the bottom of the spiral staircase,
      and leaps down onto another adjacent landing. She looks out,
      trying to see the beast through the turrets.

      The beast swings around a third parapet and leaps onto another.
      He's now as far as he can get from Gaston.

      Finally, Belle reaches a point where she can see the beast on
      the faraway turret. She screams out as his grip slips.             

                          BELLE                                          
                NO!                                                      

      The beast's head turns.
                                                         93.


                       THE BEAST
          Belle?

And he spots her.                                                  

                    THE BEAST (CONT'D)                             
              (roars)                                              
          BELLE! You came back!                                    

                    BELLE                                          
          I tried to stop them!                                    

                    THE BEAST                                      
          Stay there! I'm coming!                                  

Gaston drops onto the walkway lined with gargoyles, landing        
directly between the beast and Belle. He sneers -- the upper       
hand is still his. His eyes search for a weapon... he grabs        
a stone spire, and breaks it off.

With superhuman agility, the beast makes a giant leap from the
far parapet back toward the central turrets. Back toward Belle. 

Belle descends the stairs, finally reaching the beast's lair.

The beast lands on the gargoyle walk and Gaston jumps out,
bringing his club cracking down on the beast's back. The
beast roars in pain. But he pushes past Gaston.

With Gaston landing blow after blow on the beast's back, the
beast staggers down a set of stairs onto the landing of a stone
footbridge (where Gaston's pistol came to rest earlier).

                       BELLE                                       
          Stop!     Gaston, no!                                    

Belle watches the beast lumbering across the footbridge -- which
crumbles under each mighty footfall.

The beast reaches the cupola on the far side, directly
parallel to the lair. One giant leap stands between him and        
Belle...

Gaston lifts the club to deliver the death blow -- when the
beast snatches it. He yanks the club away and hurls it
against a far wall.                                                

With a snarl, the beast's paw is around Gaston's throat. He
lifts Gaston and swings him out over the edge of the landing.

                     GASTON
                 (snivelling)
          No. Don't let me go. Please. Don't
          hurt me, beast. I'll do anything.

TIGHT ON THE BEAST -- his features twisted with rage and hate --
but he controls himself -- and his anger fades.
                                                               94.


                          THE BEAST
                I AM NOT A BEAST.

      He sets Gaston down.

                           THE BEAST (CONT'D)
                Go.   Get out.

      Gaston scrambles to his feet, and the beast lunges, chasing
      him away down the outer staircase of the cupola.                  

133   EXT. BALCONY - CASTLE - NIGHT                             133

      Belle gazes proudly into the beast's eyes, across the final
      chasm that separates them.

134   EXT. CASTLE - CUPOLA - NIGHT                              134

      The beast has just enough distance for a head start to leap       
      across to the lair balcony.

                           BELLE
                No!   It's too far!

      But the beast has already gotten down on all fours. His hind
      claws dig into the stone. And then he's off, gaining speed as
      he runs on all legs. Belle gasps -- and the beast leaps.

      He's airborne, flying over the chasm -- and he just makes it to
      the balcony -- landing on all fours! He rises, and smiles.       

      BOOM! The beast roars in agony. Past him, across the chasm,
      Belle spots Gaston on the crumbling walkway, pistol back in
      hand. He grins as he reloads for the kill shot -- and as Belle
      watches, helpless, he takes aim again -- and fires.

      The beast drops -- just as the walkway beneath Gaston             
      collapses. In an instant, there's nothing beneath his feet,       
      and he disappears, screaming, in a cascade of stones.

      Belle cradles the beast's head. Anguished. He lies there,
      breathing heavily. Softly, the beast rests his paw on Belle's
      hand. Fading, his eyes look at her with perfect love.          

                          THE BEAST
                You came back.

                          BELLE
                Of course I came back.   I'll never
                leave you again.

                          THE BEAST
                I'm afraid it's my turn to leave.

                          BELLE
                We're together now.   It's going to be                  
                fine. You'll see.
                                                                  95.


                          THE BEAST
                At least I got to see you one last time.

      The paw drops as the beast dies in her arms.

                          BELLE
                No... please, no...

135   EXT. TERRACE - CASTLE - NIGHT                               135

      As villagers stagger away in defeat, Lumière turns to Plumette,  
      takes her in his arms, about to give her a V-Day kiss.

                          LUMIÈRE                                        
                We did it, Plumette.   Victory is ours.

      Plumette is silent in Lumière's embrace.

                          LUMIÈRE (CONT'D)                               
                Plumette...? Oh! My dear Plumette...                     

      Cogsworth helps Lumière lower Plumette to the ground. Opposite  
      them, Garderobe stands beside Cadenza, reunited at last.        

                          GARDEROBE                                      
                Oh, maestro! You were so brave!                          
                Goodbye, my love...                                      

      Her arms retract -- as the footlights inside her dim and die.      

                           CADENZA                                       
                Darling!   No, don't leave me!                           

      Cadenza sobs. We move along the few keys he has left until they 
      freeze into silence. We TILT UP to the music stand. No hint of  
      a face. Froufrou emerges from the foyer, pawing at his master  
      and mistress, then goes still. Nothing more than a piano stool  
      now.                                                            

      Mrs. Potts frantically approaches Cogsworth and Lumière.

                         MRS. POTTS
                CHIP! CHIP! Have you seen Chip!? He
                ran off! Oh, where is my little boy --

      Lumière and Cogsworth watch in horror as Mrs. Potts' face          
      disappears into the painted ornamentation of the tea pot.          

                           CHIP                                          
                Mama!                                                    

      Lumière turns to Cogsworth, panicked that Chip might see           
      what's happened.                                                   

                           COGSWORTH                                     
                Oh no.                                                   
                                                                  96.


      Just as he leaps up, his features fade away and gravity takes       
      over. The saucer plummets, shattering. But Chapeau catches          
      Chip in mid-air -- and lovingly places him, inanimate, onto         
      the trolley cart beside Mrs. Potts.                                 

      Chapeau straightens himself nobly, and becomes a coat rack.         
      All around Cogsworth and Lumière, the staff goes still.             

                             COGSWORTH (CONT'D)
                   Lumière... I... TICK... can't...

                   friend... TOCK... it was an honor to
                   serve with you.

      The only sound Cogsworth makes is `tick tock, tick tock.'
      Lumière is alone. Surrounded by objects.

                             LUMIÈRE
                   The honor was mine.                                    

      Lumière does a final twirl and stiffens.      He is a candlestick.  

136   INT. BEAST'S LAIR - WEST WING - CASTLE - NIGHT               136

      ANGLE ON THE BELL JAR. The final rose petal drops -- just as        
      a HOODED FIGURE appears. We move up to reveal: AGATHE.              

                             BELLE
                       (to the beast)                                     
                   Please, don't leave me.    Come back.

      TIGHT ON BELLE -- her lips touch the beast's forehead in a          
      kiss.

                             BELLE (CONT'D)
                   I love you.

      Hearing these words, Agathe smiles benevolently and places          
      her hand on the bell jar -- which explodes and releases a           
      wave of rose petals, whirling into the air.                         

      A golden light begins to emanate from Agathe. It encircles          
      the beast and he too begins to rise. Belle gets to her feet,        
      watching as the beast is lifted and enveloped by the swirling

      He lands on his feet and looks down at his hands, his arms,         
      his chest. He turns -- and sees Belle.

      Slowly he steps toward her, and she to him.                          

      In silent disbelief, Belle runs her fingers through his hair.        
      She looks into the Prince's blue eyes. It is him. Tears of           
      grief turn to tears of joy as they lean in for their first           
      kiss.

      Magic explodes outwards. And with it, the dawn breaks. The     
      castle transforms like someone is giving it a wash of gold. The
      magic spreads across the balcony as the sun rises on the
      terrace, traveling down the castle facade -- creepy stone
      gargoyles turn into noble statuary --

      As the light passes over, an upside-down FROUFROU transforms    
      back into a tiny BICHON FRISE basking in the sun. He leaps up  
      and chases his tail (still a tassle), then trots over to CHAPEAU
                                                                      
      and relieves himself on his leg -- which changes into a human  
      foot.                                                           

      Chapeau transforms back into a VALET and shoos the dog   away        
      with his walking stick. As the dog weaves through his    legs,       
      the valet loses his balance and bumps into the trolley   cart        
      holding Mrs. Potts and Chip. It starts to roll toward    the         
      stairs.                                                              

      The valet backs into Garderobe, who waddles in and out of            
      sunlight, changing from wardrobe to human to wardrobe again.         
      Cadenza's face comes alive as he sees the wardrobe falling           
      onto him. As it crashes, the wardrobe's doors fly open,              
      sending out a flurry of garments. We follow them back to the         
      ground, where the human DIVA now lies on top of the human            
      MAESTRO.

      The maestro smiles his now-toothless grin.    She tearfully          
      embraces him -- as their dog joins in.                               

      The trolley rolls past, taking us to Cogsworth, whose back is        
      bathed in sunlight. We move around to reveal the pudgy               
      MAJORDOMO, human except for his moustache, which still               
      resembles the hands of a clock. He peers through his

      They greet each other as a feather floats by, brushing the        
      footman's nose. They look over to see --                          

      A pile of feathers... from which the footman pulls the            
      sexiest French MAID in history, her feathers blossoming into

      And then, the greatest kiss ever. Their passion ignites a         
      tiny flame on the footman's head, which the maid pats out.        
      They turn as they hear --                                         

      The trolley SQUEAKING as it nears the steps, about to crash       
      down. Mrs. Potts and Chip rattle on a tray, which suddenly        
      jerks to a stop on the precipice. The valet has hooked the        
      cart with his walking stick, but...                               

      Mrs. Potts and Chip slide down the incline... shoot off the       
      tray... and start to TRANSFORM IN MID-AIR! They sled to the       
      bottom of the steps and skid to a halt, fully human again.        
      CHIP hugs his MOTHER... he finally got her to skate!
