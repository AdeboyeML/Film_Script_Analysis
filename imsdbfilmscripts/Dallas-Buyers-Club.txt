1   EXT. RODEO STADIUM - DALLAS - TEXAS - DAY                        1

    Ambient sounds of the CROWD, RODEO, SEX, and a strange
    RINGING fade in along with IMAGES of...

    A COWBOY riding a BULL in an enclosed RODEO ring.

    RON WOODROOF, early 40's, handsome, long sandy hair, denim
    clad, worn snakeskin boots, dusty, cowboy hat, mirrored
    aviators, is engaged in wild SEX with a WOMAN. He watches the
    rodeo through open slats in a BULL STALL as the STEER throws
    the COWBOY violently thru the air; he lands hard on the dirt.
    Another WOMAN snorts cocaine and offers some to Ron as he
    switches over to having SEX with her.

    The BULL STOMPS the Cowboy with its HOOFS.

    Ron climaxes -- pleasure and pain seem to come out of him, but
    we can't hear him, only this strange RINGING.

    RODEO CLOWNS grab the Cowboy's limp body and drag him out of
    the ring.

    Ron catches his breath; something is off.

                          RON (V.O.)
                Did ya hear Rock Hudson was a cock
                sucker?


2   EXT. RODEO STADIUM - LOCKER ROOM - DAY                           2

    A Dallas NEWSPAPER folded in half. July. 1985.      AIDS. New
    treatment. In Paris. ROCK HUDSON on the cover.      A HAND
    scribbles numbers over the photo.

                          CLINT (V.O.)
                Where'd ya hear that?

    CLINT (32) a greasy hick who's spent the last five months
    under the hood of a CHEVY, hands RON a WAD of CASH.

                          RON
                It's called a newspaper.     You heard of
                it?

    Ron smiles, adjusts his cowboy hat as he records some bets.
    Nearby, BULL FIGHTERS are putting on their clown makeup.

                          RON
                What a waste. All that fine Hollywood
                pussy on a guy who smokes his friends.

    A HAND comes down through the slats holding a ten dollar bill.

                          RON
                C'mon Rog, this ain't the sandbox.
                Twenty's the minimum.

    ROG slides another ten down; Ron snatches it.

                          ROG
                Who the hell's Rock Hudson?

    Ron looks at Rog.   A beat, then he starts laughing, then
    coughing...


3   EXT. RODEO STADIUM - BULL STALL - DAY                            3

    ...and coughing as we follow him into the stalls. Ron glad-
    hands as he goes; it seems everyone knows him but doesn't
    necessarily like him. He makes his way toward T.J., white
    trash, pale as winter, who wipes vomit from his chin. As he
    nervously looks down at the big angry BULL he's about to ride,
    Ron hands him a pint of tequila.

                          RON
                Calm the nerves, brother.     You look
                great.

    T.J. takes a swig, gives him a look.

                          RON
                It's your day, I can feel it.

    T.J. watches as Ron takes a bottle of NYQUIL out of his pocket
    and downs it... to stop his hacking cough.

                          T.J.
                I don't know, Ron.

    Ron fans the money out for T.J. to see.

                          RON
                Eight seconds and you'll be gettin blown
                by a hundred dollar hooker before you can
                scrape the bullshit off your boots.

    Ron winks and smiles. T.J. signals the BULLMAN that he's
    ready. And in five, four, three, two, one...

    THE GATE is up, the BULL is out, the crowd is HOLLERING and
    T.J.'s back is bending in unnatural ways.

                          RON
                C'mon! One one thousand, two one
                thousand, three one thousand...
              Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 3


    And T.J. is DOWN.

                          RON
                Ah hen shit!

    Ron looks to the BLEACHERS.   The GAMBLERS are already
    searching for him.

    Ron slips out a SIDE ENTRANCE.


4   EXT. RODEO STADIUM - PARKING LOT - DAY                           4

    Sweating, heart racing, Ron runs across the lot and jumps over
    fences to escape THE GAMBLERS that are running after him. As
    they close in, Ron spots a cop, TUCKER, walking towards his
    patrol car.

                          RON
                Hey, buddy I need you to arrest me.

                          TUCKER
                Fuck off, Woodroof.

                          RON
                Come on, man. I'm serious!

    Tuck sees the angry mob approaching.

                           TUCKER
                Looks like you got a few pissed off
                customers.

                          RON
                You gonna cuff me or what?

                          TUCKER
                Figure it out yourself.

    And with that, Ron PUNCHES Tucker in the face.    The mob of
    Gamblers are stopped in their tracks.

                          TUCKER
                You son of a bitch!

    Tucker PUNCHES Ron in the face twice, then cuffs him.    He
    looks at the mob of Gamblers.

                          TUCKER
                Get the fuck outta here before I arrest
                all of you.

    Ron smiles through a bloodied mouth.

    Tucker's police car pulls up.

                          TUCKER (V.O.)
                They're gonna kick the shit out of you
                one day, Woodroof. Maybe worse.


6   INT. TUCKER'S POLICE CAR - DAY                                 6

    Both Ron and Tucker are bleeding and bruised.

                          RON
                Gotta die from somethin'.

                          TUCKER
                Handle your business, huh?    Get your
                shit together.

                          RON
                You're startin' to sound like your
                ol' man. How's he doin' by the way?

                           TUCKER

                Though I can't imagine how disappointed
                he must be havin' you for a son.

    Tucker looks at him, half-smiles.

                          TUCKER
                Get the fuck outta my car.

    Ron smiles, starts to get out, then stops. Holds his head a
    moment. We hear the strange RINGING sound again.

                            TUCKER (CONT'D)
                You okay?

                You rattled my fuckin' brain.

                          TUCKER
                What brain?

    Ron forces a smile, then exits the car. Tucker watches as Ron
    slowly heads toward his trailer; something seems off. After a
    few beats, Tucker brushes it off and pulls away.


7   INT. RON'S TRAILER - DAY                                         7

    Books, newspapers, empty beer cans and liquor bottles; on
    the wall, we may notice a painting of some Texas Wildflowers.
    Ron stumbles in as the RINGING sound comes back. He stops,
    steadies himself on a piece of furniture, takes a few steps
    then collapses, unconscious.


8   INT. RON'S TRAILER - MORNING                                     8

    The first shafts of sunlight fall over Ron, still asleep where
    he dropped. After a few beats, he stirs, pulls himself on to
    a chair. "What the fuck?".


9   EXT. OIL FIELD - DAY                                             9

    Lunch time. Already a little drunk, Ron finishes off a pint
    of whiskey as Clint and a battered T.J. eat sandwiches nearby.
    Ron starts coughing again as he grabs a packet of cocaine out
    of his shirt pocket. He slides it across the table to Clint
    who hands him cash.

                          RON
                That shit is purer than a preacher
                daughter's pussy.

                          CLINT
                Not after you just coughed your lungs all
                over it.

                They pay five times as much, that's why.

    Ron raises his eyebrows, not bad.

                 It's a Muslim country.    You can't fuck
                 the women.

                 Now that takes me out right there.

     The FOREMAN races over to them.

                           FOREMAN
                 Woodroof, there's been an accident on
                 platform five. They need an electrician
                 right away!


10   EXT. DRILL PLATFORM - DAY - LATER                                10

     A MEXICAN WORKER has his leg caught in the drill. It's
     severed and he's losing blood fast. Ron walks over.

                              RON
                 Dumb spic.     How'd you get your leg in
                 there?

     The guy's breath is coming in short fast spurts.

                 Where's the ambulance?

                           FOREMAN
                 He's illegal.

     Ron takes his OWN shirt off, rips it in half, kneels down next
     to the MEXICAN, wipes some sweat off his brow and ties a
     makeshift tourniquet around his leg.

     Ron looks to the Foremen.

                           RON
                 Go call `em.
                     (the FOREMEN doesn't move)
                 Go FUCKING call `em.

     He walks off to call.    Ron turns back to the Mexican.

                           RON
                 Alright we're going to get you outta
                 there but you gotta stay still until I
                 say get the fuck out and then you get the
                 fuck out. Comprende?

     The guy nods. Ron walks over to the electrician's box. He's
     a little DRUNK. He grabs a wire and is about to cut it.

                           RON (CONT'D)
                 Alright, on the count of three.   One,
                 two...

     Ron cuts the wire, an electrical spark shoots out and before
     he can move back the box blows up in his face. Everything
     goes black.

                           RICK FERRIS (V.O.)
                 Azidothymidine, or AZT -- was originally

     Barrow Wilkem rep RICK FERRIS, slick, well-dressed, gold
     Rolex, 40s, stands before DR. NATHAN SEVARD, 50's, arrogant,
     DR. EVE SAKS, early 30s, sophisticated, and five other
     PHYSICIANS, 40s-60s, all members of the hospital board.

                           RICK FERRIS
                 With the onset of HIV, however, we at
                 Barrow Wilkem began a trial in which we
                 administered AZT to infected lab animals.
                 Initial findings suggested increased CD4
                 counts, restored T-cell immunity and also
                 evidence of inducing weight gain.

                           SEVARD
                 Isn't it also true that it had some
                 concerning side effects in animal tests,
                 significantly decreasing the animals red
                 and white blood cells?

                           RICK FERRIS
                 Yes, but its effect on the virus is
                 better than anything else that's been
                 tested.

                 In 64, when AZT was developed for cancer
                 treatment, it was shelved due to lack of
                 anti cancer efficacy and toxicity.

                 We believe those problems were dosage

                           EVE
                 So you're conducting another animal

                           RICK FERRIS
                 Actually the FDA has given us permission
                 to go straight to human trials which is
                 what brings me here today. We're
                 conducting a double-blind, placebo-
                 controlled randomized trial throughout
                 the United States. Dallas Mercy is one
                 of the proposed sites.

                           EVE
                 How long do you see the study going on?

                           RICK FERRIS
                 We're hoping to fast track it within a
                 year? During which time the hospital and
                 its administering physicians will be very
                 well compensated for their efforts.

     Eve notices as Sevard trades looks with Board Member #1.

                           RICK FERRIS
                 Sadly, the AIDS crisis will only get
                 worse before it gets better. And I
                 know I speak for everyone at Barrow
                 Wilkem when I say getting this drug to
                 market is our number one priority. This
                 is a unique opportunity. A chance to be
                 on the forefront in finding a cure.

     Eve looks at Ferris and smiles.

                 Does it not drive you just a little bit
                 crazy when these guys stand up there

13   INT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - ROOM - DAY                             13

     Ron, head and eyes bandaged, lays on a bed. After a few
     beats, he peels off the eye bandages, gets up. He opens a
     cabinet, then a drawer. Finds a bag of sucking CANDY, pops a
     piece in his mouth, puts some in his pocket. He sees his
     jacket on the back of the door, searches his pockets for a
     cigarette. He's about to light one when Dr. Sevard enters
     with Eve Sakes. Both wear surgical masks and latex gloves.

                              DR. SEVARD
                    Mr. Woodroof. I'm Dr. Sevard.

terminology he doesn't understand.

     Music BLARES as Ron and T.J. party with two hot girls, KELLY
     and CRYSTAL, 20s. T.J. cuts a line of coke on a mirror while
     Ron dances over to the girls with SHOTS of Jack Daniels. They
     both start kissing, then rubbing up against Ron.

     T.J. is having sex with Kelly as Ron kisses Crystal; he leans
     down, snorts what is probably his fiftieth line of coke. He
     shakes it off, slams some Jack Daniels from the bottle as if
     it was Kool Aid. He's obliterated.

     As Ron stares off at something, T.J. waves at Crystal to join
     him and Kelly; as she does, we see what Ron is staring at -- a
     CALENDAR.

     But its days have no numbers. Except one, in blood RED -- 30.
     Ron snaps out of his hallucination.

     does a line of coke.

            they'll give you two weeks off. You
            should try it.

Ron takes the dollar back as T.J. walks to the table to pour
himself a drink.

                      T.J.
            Well, you didn't miss nothin' at work.

Ron does a line of coke.   Sees his reflection in the mirror.
Pushes it away.

Ron abruptly stands.

            a hug from a bunch of faggots?

     Ron bursts through the door and shouts to the BARTENDER.

                 Neddie Jay, one shot of Cactus and a
                 Rolling Rock back.

     Ned doesn't move as Ron continues toward a table where T.J.,
     Clint and three other FRIENDS are sitting.

                           RON
                 I can't believe how much I missed your

     Clint drains his beer, slams it on the table.

     Ron takes a step towards Clint, T.J. gets up and stands
     between them.

                           T.J.
                 C'mon Ron, we don't want no trouble.

     Ron puts a fake, friendly hand on T.J.'s shoulder who backs
     off immediately. Ron moves closer, plays with T.J. and the
     others. They're all scared of being touched.

     Ron looks at him, grabs T.J.'S BEER from his hands and downs
     it, then fakes as if he's going to hit T.J. with it. T.J.
     flinches, then Ron SLAMS it on the table. Gives one last look
     to all of them.

                 As I stand here tonight, clinical trials
                 are underway with an eye toward fast-
                 tracking AZT and making it available
                 for the public as soon as possible.


23   INT. DRADDY AUDITORIUM - DALLAS HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT              23

     Rick Ferris from Barrow Wilkem stands at the podium before the
     packed room.

                           RICK FERRIS
                 In short, I'm happy to say that help may
                 finally be on the way.

     That is Ron's POV as he listens to Ferris, looking around at
     the crowd, who are almost exclusively gay MEN. Ron wanders
     toward a table lined with LITERATURE. An EFFEMINATE MAN
     approaches him with a pamphlet. Ron stares at him blankly.
     The man opens his arms to give him a hug.

                           EFFEMINATE MAN
                 It's okay brother. We're all getting --

                 far down your throat you'd be usin' your
                 ass to chew food.

     The Man's eyes go wide as he backs off. Ron turns back to the
     table, takes a few pamphlets. Titles include: "POPPERS STUDY:
     POSSIBLE CAUSE OF AIDS"; "AZT SHOWS SIGNS OF PROMISE". Ron
     drifts toward the front, where the CROWD is getting hostile.

     frustration and we're suddenly--

     CLOSE ON -- a line of flickering CANDLES.

     That's Ron's POV as he grimaces, despair in his eyes. He
     doesn't look at the moving, out-of-focus SILHOUETTES in front
     of him.

     Ron downs a shooter and grimaces again. He slams the glass
     down on a table among empty glasses and looks up at the
     candles on a stage in front of a STRIPPER, lost in his
     thoughts. Then he looks up and sees something across the
     room, past the stripper. She tries to get his attention.

                           STRIPPER
                 If you're not gonna look or buy a dance,

                 I'll take a dance, but not fer me.

     And he walks off towards a man at the end of the bar: the
     Hispanic Orderly from the hospital.

     Cowboy boots nervously play with a McDonald's Bag on the
     ground next to a garbage dumpster. They stop when the
     Hispanic Orderly walks out of the hospital. He gets to the
     dumpster, throws a BROWN PAPER BAG in it, picks up the
     McDonald's bag, looks inside and leaves without a word.

      Ron removes a pill, decides two is better, washes them down
      with a beer, and sniffs a line of coke. Looks at his
      reflection in the turned-off T.V.

      As Ron pulls up to his jobs site in his battered '73 Lincoln,
      he spots T.J., Clint and a half dozen other WORKERS through
      the windshield, all staring at him menacingly. Before Ron
      gets out, the Foreman emerges through the crowd. Without a
      word, the guy just slowly shakes his head. Ron gives him the
      finger and drives off, popping a few more AZT pills.

      Empty; closed for the day. Ron sits in the empty bleachers,
      sweaty and shivering; he looks horrible, maybe disoriented.
      He pops a pill of AZT and drinks from a bottle of Tequila.

      A labyrinth of identical trailers. Ron wanders, searching for
      his own. Confused, he changes direction and continues to make
      his way down the different rows.

      He stops in front of one and stares at the door where two
      YOUNG BOYS are seated on the steps, staring back at him.

                            RON
                  The hell you doin' here?

      He waves them aside. As he walks up the steps, his neighbor
      BUCKY and his WIFE stare at him blankly.

                 Why you so good to me?

     Rayon watches Eve for a while, with affection. He grabs her
     and holds on to her. These two seem to have a history.

     A steady drizzle. Ron stands out by the dumpster, his boots
     and cowboy hat soaked. The Hispanic Orderly emerges from the
     hospital, a large garbage bag in his hands.

     snatches it, and writes something on a piece of paper.

     Ron takes a swing at the Orderly but misses. Something about
     Ron is off. We hear the ringing sound again. Ron struggles

     deep into the muscle and massages. Ron contorts in pain,

     the trunk. Grabs a single-barreled Winchester SHOTGUN lying
     within it. He checks the CHAMBER, spins the gun, does a few

     in a flash levels it and BLASTS the lock off his trailer door.

                 effective in stopping the progression of
                 AIDS in asymptomatic cases. Dr. Anthony
                 Fauci, head of the National Institute of
                 Health, announced that a trial had
                 clearly shown that early AZT intervention
                 will keep AIDS at bay. AZT is the only
                 drug that has been shown in
                 scientifically controlled trials to be
                 safe and effective, Fauci contended.

      beneath his oxygen mask. After a few beats, he takes it off,
      leans over to the side table, takes a compact and a tube of
      lipstick from his purse, and starts to apply it, his hands
      trembling as he does. His mission accomplished, he sets the
      lipstick aside, then leans his head back. And as he closes
      his eyes and drifts away...

                  milk, the antibiotics in the chicken.
                  Now that's the shit the FDA knows will
                  kill you. Yet you're all up there

      Ron throws the bag of jelly beans to the security man who
      catches it. And he leaves the room, squeaking away.

Eve looks away.   Ron opens his arms...

                      RON
            A nice, warm hug...

He takes the can back.

Ron downs some beer.

      CLOSE ON Ron's box of meds, almost empty. By the look on his
      face, Ron clearly just woke up. But there is something else.
      He takes an empty bottle of Peptide T and looks at it,
      confused. Hears the strange ringing again...

      his hands over his ears, and walks out.

      Ron tries to direct traffic, bear foot. People blare their
      car horns. Others scream out their windows. A POLICEMAN
      arrives on the scene and approaches Ron.

      Tucker pulls up and sees Ron, he jumps out of his car.

                  Ron! You are in the middle of the

      Ron, dressed in a conservative suit, is looking extremely ill.
      Next to him is David Wayne and two other younger ATTORNEYS.

      On the opposing side are FDA representatives including Richard
      Barkley and others who we haven't ever seen before. They have
      a team of four attorneys.

                            JUDGE
                  The constitution, specifically the ninth
                  amendment, does not state that you have
                  the right to be mentally healthy or
                  physically healthy. It does state that
                  you have a right to chose your own
                  medical care but that is interpreted as
                  medical care that is approved by the Food
                  and Drug Administration.

      The Judge looks over to the FDA table.

                            JUDGE
                  Regarding the FDA, the court is highly
                  disturbed by its bullying tactics and
                  direct interference with a drug whose own
                  agency has found to be non-toxic. The
                  FDA was formed to protect people, not
                  prevent them from getting help.

      The Judge sighs.

                            JUDGE
                  The law does not seem to make much common
                  sense. If a person has been found to be
                  terminally ill they ought to be able to
                  take just about any drug they feel will
                  help... but that is not the law. Mr.
                  Woodroof, there is not a person in this
                  courtroom who is not moved to compassion
                  by your plight, what is lacking here is
                  the legal authority to intervene. I'm
                  sorry. This case is hereby dismissed.

      The Judge bangs the gavel.

      David Wayne raises in frustration.   Ron closes his eyes,
      defeated.

      victory on their faces. Ron doesn't understand. They walk to
      him and show him a paper with the FDA logo on it.

      Black.

      Super:

       Following the trial, the FDA in Washington allowed Ron to get
                    Peptide T for his own personal use.

      And as the cheering and clapping grow bigger, we cut to:


148   EXT. RODEO - DAY                                                 148

      Ron, 20 pounds heavier, looking healthier, is sitting atop the
      railing above the stall looking down at the bull. He's got on
      gloves, hat, pants, and boots, ready to ride. He removes a
      flask from his pocket and takes a long swig. The BULLHAND and
      Ron exchange a look. Ron nods, takes a deep breath, swings
      his legs over the railing, straddles the stall, stays above
      the animal. The moment Ron's ass hits the leather, the gate
      is up, the bull is out, and the crowd whoops it up.

      Rodeo contestant number "43" Ron Woodroof rides the bull, his
      hands, legs and heels all working together. His "off" hand is
      held out above him, cutting the air for balance.

      The bull makes an abrupt change of direction, catches Ron off
      guard and just when it seems that he's about to be thrown in
      the air, we hear Eve screaming her guts out as the image
      freezes on a PERFECT FRAME on this cowboy in action to control
      the beast.

      The crowd's CHEERS are echoing in the distance, blended with
      the soft strange ring that we know, that only Ron could hear.

      And as we zoom in on the image:

                                                          FADE TO BLACK.

      Ronald Woodroof died on September 12, 1992, seven years after he
      was diagnosed with the HIV virus. He managed to stay alive
      using unapproved drugs and was memorialized by 1000 gay men in
      Dallas, Texas.

Fluconazole and Alpha Interferon are now FDA approved.

DDC was approved in 1992 but is no longer used due to its
highly toxic effects.

Peptide T remains unapproved but still in studies for
neurological diseases, like Alzheimer.

Today, it is had been   scientifically proven that HIV is the
cause of AIDS. Based    on this knowledge, great strides have
been made in treating   this infection with anti-HIV medications
but a cure has yet to   be discovered.

The first studies with AZT as a single drug (monotherapy)
while showing initial good results did not ultimately prove to
be a long term solution for HIV treatment.

By 1996, medical researchers learned that HIV is best treated
with a combination cocktail of at least three HIV medications.
AZT was frequently used as a part of these early combination
therapies. Today, AZT has been largely replaced by safer, new
HIV medications.                                                     *
