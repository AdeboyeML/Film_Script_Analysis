              This is unbelievable - look at
              this. There's no city like this in
              the world. There never was.
                        INEZ (V.O.)
              It's become so touristy.
                         GIL (V.O.)
              Well that's just the awful era we
              live in but can you just imagine
              what this was like before - but
              even with all the fast food joints
              and the traffic - god, you just
              can't imagine what it was like
              years ago.
                         INEZ (V.O.)
              Well you like cities.
                        GIL (V.O.)
              I really do - I love cities - I
              love big cities with all the crowds
              and all the action.

              for a few days is nothing - my

              your novel to read. I'm sure he'd
              be able to critique your writing

     Gil wanders. Eventually he is at a lovely spot. Perhaps by

     Either by his watch or a nearby building clock, the hands
     move to exactly midnight. perhaps midnight chimes somewhere.
     At precisely that moment a car happens to pull up along side

              could be one of the great writers

              write melodies - and I try - and
              then I hear the songs he writes and
              I realize I'll never write a great
              lyric and that my talent really
              lies in drinking.

                   I believe that love that's true and
                   real creates a respite from death.
                   All cowardice comes from not loving
                   or not loving well which is the
                   same thing and when the man who is
                   brave and true looks death squarely
                   in the face like some rhino hunters
                   I know or Belmonte who is truly
                   brave, it is because they love with
                   sufficient passion to push death
                   out of their minds till it returns
                   as it does to all men and then you
                   must make really good love again.

                design for the theatre. Believe

               Nevertheless you have to get rid of
               all that technology - what's good
               about your book are the characters -
               the human questions - love -
               mortality - nobody cares about the
               technology, they care about the
               human heart. We all fear death and
               question our place in the universe.
               Unfortunately your book lapses into
               easy pessimism. I was having this
               conversation with Giacometti the
               other day - he's such a gloom

               succumb to despair but to find an
               antidote to the emptiness of

                               GIL
                    Because if you stay here and this
                    becomes your present, sooner or
                    later you'll imagine another time
                    was really the golden time. And so
                    will I - I'm beginning to see why
                    it can't work, Adriana. The
                    present has a hold on you because
                    it's your present and while there's
                    never any progress in the most
                    important things, you get to
                    appreciate - what little progress
                    is made - the internet - Pepto-
                    Bismol. The present is always
                    going to seem unsatisfying because
                    life itself is unsatisfying -
                    that's why Gauguin goes back and
                    forth between Paris and Tahiti,
                    searching - it's my job as a writer
                    to try and come up with reasons why
                    despite life being tragic and
                    unsatisfying, it's still worth it.
                               ADRIANA
                    That's the problem with writers -
                    you're all so full of words - but
                    I'm more emotional. I'm going to
                    stay and live in Paris' most
                    glorious time. You made a choice
                    to leave Paris once and you
                    regretted it.

                    Yes, that one I regretted but it
                    was a real choice and I made the
                    wrong one. This is a choice

                  at midnight each night and he
                  followed close behind.
