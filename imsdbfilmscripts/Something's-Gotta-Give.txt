                                                            1.








OVER BLACK

We hear, Ja Rule's "Livin' It Up"...







EXT. NEW YORK CITY - A HOT AUGUST NIGHT - MUSIC OVER

MIDTOWN. A Brunette Beauty crosses in front of a stack of
cabs, her sheer dress clinging to her remarkable body.
A Club in THE MEATPACKING DISTRICT. A long line waits to get
in. A couple of Gorgeous Girls show up at the velvet rope and
are promptly" let inside.
SOHO. A Crowd spills out of a Bar and onto the sidewalk. A
Confident Knock Out in jeans and a tank top laughs, drinking
a beer out of the bottle.

                       HARRY (V.O.)

             Ahhhh... The sweet, uncomplicated
             satisfaction of The Younger Woman. That
             fleeting age when everything just falls
             right into place. It's magic time and it
             can render any man, anywhere --
             absolutely helpless. Some say I'm an
             expert on The Younger Woman. Guess that's
             'cause I've been dating them for over
             forty years...







INTO AN EMPTY FRAME COMES HARRY LANGER

What is it about him? Could be his eyes, the turn of his
mouth...something about this guy is just so damn appealing.
Maybe it's just the way he wears the Young Slinky Girl on his
arm. He's confident, cool, enviable. We're in:







A CHIC EATERY - DOWNTOWN

The place is full. Everybody is somebody here.

                        HARRY

                 (to Hostess)
             Langer. ..
The Maitre'd snaps to attention at the sight of him.

                       MAITRE'D

             Mr. Langer, got your table waiting.
As Harry and his Girl wend their way around tables, we pass Other
Couples. Young Couples. Middle-aged couples. Not talking Couples.

                       HARRY (V.O.)

             So what does a life of bucking the system
             all add up to?




                                                         2.











                    HARRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)

          To never settle down with the right woman
          for a life of leftovers and Christmas
          mornings. No his and her IRA accounts, no
          mini van parked in the garage. I think
          it's made me what I am today.
              (Harry smiles to someone
               across the room)
          The luckiest son of a bitch on earth.
          Look at me. I'm positively debonair. I
          should be illegal I'm lookin' so good.
Harry passes a table where a BEATEN SIXTY YEAR OLD dines with
his AGE APPROPRIATE, WELL-FED WIFE. IN SLOW MOTION, Harry and
The Beaten Man catch each other's glance.

                    HARRY (V.O.)

          It isn't as if I haven't wondered what my
          life would be like if I was a Regular Joe
          and came in here once a month with a dame
          my age' for a porterhouse and a side of
I         spinach. I've wondered...







 NT. CHIC EATERY - HARRY'S IMAGINATION

Harry ENTERS all over again. This time he looks older,
something in his walk and the boxy cut of his jacket. With
him is a regular looking, nothing-to-write-home-about WOMAN

IN HER FIFTIES.


                    HARRY (V.O.)

          No, come on, let's be honest. ..a dame
          really my age. . .







INT. CHIC EATERY - HARRY'S IMAGINATION - TAKE TWO

Again, the identical set up. Harry ENTERS again. This time he
looks ten years older. The bounce to his step is gone. The
twinkle in his eye, long dead. On his arm is a 63 YEAR OLD
BATTLE AX, built just like Harry. The Maitre'd reluctantly
shows them to a shitty table.

                    HARRY (V.O.)

          There you have it. The story in a
          nutshell. Not exactly debonair, am I?
              (Harry TRIPS, his wife
               looks disgusted)
          Awww, man, it's down right sad. Look at
          me. I look like I'm about to die. God
          help me. I do not want to die.

                                            SMASH CUT TO:





                                                         3.














A LONG STRETCH OF PRISTINE COUNTRY ROAD - THE HAMPTONS - DAY

A Silver Mercedes convertible bursts into FRAME. Harry's
behind the wheel, shades, smoking a cigar, livin' large. Next
to him sits a thoroughbred of a girl. An "IT" Girl. Smart,
sexy and built for fun. She has perfected flirting to an art.
Her hand rests on Harry's neck. There's a good thirty year
age difference between them. Her name is MARIN. She SINGS
along with Ja Rule, now coming from a CD.

                    MARIN

              ( singing)
          To all my thugs that be livin' it
          up, we say, what I do. To all my...
              (stops)
          Oh! This is it. Make a right.

                    HARRY

              (admiring the
               neighborhood)
          So baby, you're rich... .

                    MARIN

          Well, my mother is, sort of. Not
          really...

                    HARRY

          If she lives within a mile of here, she's
          rich.

                    MARIN

          I guess a hit play will buy you a house
          in The Hamptons.

                    HARRY

          I'd like to meet your mother.

                    MARIN

          No you wouldn't. I mean, she's
          great. She's totally brilliant, but
          she's not your type.

                    HARRY

          You're overlooking one of the great
          things about me. I don't have a type.

                    MARIN

              (very directly)
          She's over thirty.
Harry looks to Marin, feigning hurt.

                    MARIN

          Oh, what?! Like you don't know you
          have a slight reputation for...




                                                         4.










Just then the CAR PHONE RINGS. Harry keeps looking at Marin.

                    HARRY

          -- For what?
Harry waits. RINGGG!
He doesn't look away.

                    MARIN

          For never dating anyone over 30.
          Don't look at me like that.

                    HARRY

          It's just not true.

                    MARIN

          Okay. Sorry. Over 31?

                     HARRY

          Oh, so you wait 'til we get out to The
          Hamptons to let me know you're a wise
          ass.
               (answers phone)
          Hold on. . .
               (then to Marin)
          It just so happens, my dear, that women
          of a certain age, don't date me. You ever
          think of it that way? No, it's always me.
          You dames are all alike.
               (then into phone)
          Hey...

                    MARIN

              (amused, to herself)
          Dames...
Marin continues singing along with Ja Rule as Harry
confidently slips his hand onto her thigh.

                    BARRY

              (into phone)
          Vh-huh.. .I'll call back Monday. Who
          else? Monday... Monday... Say you couldn't
          find me. Who?
              (glances at Marin, she's
               not listening)
          I'll call her later. No, I have it.
Harry hangs up, doesn't look in Marin's direction to see if'
she caught that. This brand of cool is about not playing that
card. Marin turns toward him, she has been listening. They've
reached the end of the road, sand dunes, long lilting grass
and the ocean stretch before them.




                                                          5.











                    MARIN

              (all business)
          Make a right, left at the second
          fence.
Marin turns up the CD, getting herself out of whatever just
came over her, looks out the window.

                    HARRY

          Have I mentioned how gorgeous your
          breasts look in this sweater?

                    MARIN

              (blushing)
          Yes you have actually.

                     HARRY

          So it would be too much to mention it
          again. . .
Marin laughs, softening, as Harry turns down a dirt driveway,
driving toward a DREAM BEACH HOUSE.

                    HARRY

          Wow. It's the perfect beach house.

                    MARIN

          I know. My mother doesn't know how
          to do things that aren't perfect.

                    HARRY

          Which explains you.
That got her. Harry parks. She looks over at him but he's
grabbing some cigars for his shirt pocket, then looks up at
her with an innocent look that suggests he did not just say
such a lovely thought.

                    MARIN

              (trying to keep up with
               him)
          Yeah, okay, right...
They both grab their H
                     overnight bags and step out of the car.

                     ARRY

          So, what are we gonna do out here,
          just the two of us, for two whole
          days?
Marin sets her bag down, walks to Harry, wraps her arms
around his neck.

                    MARIN

          Tell me the truth, are you at all
          glad we waited?




                                                            6.











                       HARRY

             I'm incredibly glad we're finally
             going to do it.
                 (she's a bit disappointed)
             If that's the same as being glad we
             waited, then baby doll, I'm ecstatic.
Marin smiles then kisses him. He's one of those guys that
lets you kiss them.

                       HARRY

                 (slaps her tush)
             Let's go for a swim, how long will
             it take you to change?

                       MARIN

             Two minutes.
Marin starts UNBUTTONING HER SWEATER as she dances
seductively toward the front door, then notices Harry's
cigars.

                         MARIN

             Oh Har... No smoking in the house. My
             Mom doesn't allow it.

                       HARRY

             But she allows you to strip in the
             front yard and bring men you're
             dating here to...

                       MARIN

             She doesn't know everything I do...Or
             when I do it.. or where I do it.
She SLIPS OFF her sweater and DROPS IT ON HARRY'S HEAD.







INT. HOUSE

It's one of those great Beach Houses. Light filled and warm
with spectacular views of the sandy landscape wrapping around
the rear of the house. Marin, now in a tight tank, tight
pants, gives Harry the grand tour as she continues to
undress.

                       MARIN

                 (TAKING OFF her belt)
             The fabulous living room, perfect for
             entertaining an intimate group of friends
             or that special someone.
                 (DROPS her belt then
                  UNBUTTONS Harry's shirt)
             Behind me, the requisite Hampton's deck
             complete with pool and ocean view.




                                                           7.











                    MARIN (CONT'D)

              (UNBUCKLES Harry's belt)
          Your pants, please...

                    HARRY

          Ladies first.
Marin provocatively UNZIPS her pants and wriggles out of
them. She's now in a TINY TANK AND BIKINI PANTIES.

                    MARIN

          Gourmet kitchen's to your left
          where tonight I will whip you up a
          culinary feast of Mac and Cheese.
Marin HEARS Harry's ZIPPER UNZIP. She turns, her EYES
WIDENING as Harry's PANTS land on a chair. Harry is now down
to his Boxers, an Open Shirt and a fearless smile.

                    MARIN

              (smiling)
          .. O-kay, going quickly now...
          Master bedroom is that away...
They arrive in a warmly decorated GUEST BEDROOM.

                     M


                     ARIN

          And this as they say on 'Cribs',
          your favorite show, is where the
          magic happens. Do we like it? Going
          once, going twice ...

                    HARRY

          Sold.
Harry takes Marin's hand and pulls her OUT OF FRAME and ONTO
THE BED. She playfully rolls on top of him. His hands cup her
ass.

                    MARIN

          You know when I first started
          auctioneering someone told me if I was
          nervous to just picture everyone in the
          audience in their underwear. This sort of
          gives that a whole new meaning.

                    HARRY

          Why? You're not nervous now, are you?

                    MARIN

          I'm always a little nervous.

                    HARRY

              (removing his hands)
          So put on your bathing suit. I brought
          some champagne, I'll put it on ice.




                                                         8.











                    MARIN

          Me like you, Harry Langer.
She bounces off him like a kid and disappears into the
bathroom.
Harry lies there alone for a second. Catches his breath. He
sits up, feet on the floor, shoulders hunched, clears his
throat, bangs on his chest. He waits a sec then stands with a
stiffness that for the first time suggests he is not a that
young man.







INT. LIVING ROOM

Now wearing only his Boxer Shorts, Harry crosses through the
Living ROOM, singing 'Livin' It Up' to himself. He reaches into
his bag and lifts out Two Bottles of Crystal. He sees himself in
the mirror, sucks in his gut.







INT. KITCHEN

Well stocked, the best of everything. Harry opens the door to the
fridge and just as HE DISAPPEARS BEHIND IT, the BACK DOOR OPENS
and TWO WOMEN ENTER from a beach walk, in the middle of a lively
conversation.
One of them is ERICA, Marin's Mother. The other is Erica's
Younger Sister, ZOE.
ERICA is in her mid-fifties and is a poster girl for growing old.
It's actually hard to imagine 55 looking any better. And not
because she looks 35, but because she makes 55 look graceful and
right. Erica is the "girl most likely" who went beyond
expectations but didn't realize until recently that being sure of
herself was a handicap. She doesn't try to be intimidating, she
just is.
Her sister, ZOE is in her forties. Zoe's the loose one. She
wears draw string pants and a T-shirt that says, "BOYS LIE".
The Women stop mid-sentence when they notice the REFRIGERATOR
IS WIDE OPEN. Then they SEE A PAIR OF BARE MEN'S LEGS poking

                     E

out from UNDER THE DOOR. They don' t move.

                     RICA

          Oh God. What is this?
Erica nods to Zoe, gesturing a nearby knife. Zoe grabs the knife.
Harry pokes his head out from behind the fridge, equally confused.

                    ERICA

              (in control)
          Okay, stay right where you are. We have a
          knife.




                                                         9.











                    HARRY

              (eyeing the knife)
          Do you... live here?

                    ERICA

          Okay, Mister, look, I'm gonna dial
          911 and you're not gonna move. Zoe,
          hand me the phone.
              (reaches out to Zoe
               without looking at her)

                    HARRY

          You don't understand. I'm a friend
          of your daughter's.
With that, Harry SHUTS the fridge door. The Women see he's
naked except for a Pair of Boxers. They both GASP. Zoe
FUMBLES the phone over to Erica who dials quickly..

                    ERICA

          Yeah? I don't think so. My daughter's in
          the city and you what, wandered in
          here,like high on Ecstasy..?.
              (looks at phone)
          Shit. I dialed 8-1-1.
              (redials)

                    HARRY

              (calmly starts to move)
          Honestly, if you just...

                    ERICA

          Back off. She was in the Israeli
          army. She can break you in half.
Zoe can't believe she just said that -- no truth in it
whatsoever.

                    ERICA

              (into phone)
          Yes. I have an intruder in my
          house. 29 Daniels Lane, Sagaponack.

                    HARRY

          I'm dating your daughter Marin. She
          invited me here for the weekend.
          She's in her room right now,
          changing.

                     ERICA

              (GASPS even louder, really
                   scared now)
          You're dating my daughter?




                                                        10.











                    HARRY

              (amused)
          Now who would've thought that would
          be worse news?
With that, Marin ENTERS, in a tiny bikini, sees Harry in his
shorts, Zoe holding the knife and Erica frozen, holding the
phone.

                      MARIN

          Oh, fuck.

                    ERICA

          Oh, God.
              (into phone)
          I'm sorry. False alarm. Yeah, no, I'm
          sure. No, he's not a burglar
              (with enormous difficulty)
          He's dating my daughter.

                    MARIN

          Mom, I had no idea you were coming out
          this weekend, you said you had to write.

                    ERICA

          I do. I thought I'd do it out here.

                    MARIN

          Oh, man, this is really....

                      ERICA

          Awkward.

                    MARIN

          Totally.. .but....
              (starts laughing)
          You gotta admit, sorta funny You thought
          he was a burglar? In his boxer shorts?

                    ERICA

          Yeah, well, the world's nuts, I
          don't know the man. . .

                    MARIN

              (still laughing)
          I'm sorry, it's not really funny.
          I'm an idiot. I should've told you
          I was bringing someone out.

                    E


                      RICA

          No, no, I should've told you we
          were coming. Well. Anyway, here we
          are.
               (waves to Harry)
          Hello. I'm the mother.




                                                        11.










All three Women turn to Harry who now dangles a long Lobster
shaped oven mitt over his "privates"...

                    HARRY

          Harry Langer. How are ya?

                     MARIN

          Yes. Sorry... Mom, this is my friend,
          Harry. Harry, my Mom, Erica... my Aunt,
          Zoe.
               (they all shake hands)
          Harry's sort of a new friend. I think I
          mentioned him in an e-mail. We just,
          totally spur of the moment thought we'd
          get out of the city for a few days.

                    ERICA AND ZOE

          Of course...Right...Great...

                    ERICA

              (can't look at him)
          Honey, does Harry have a robe?

                     HARRY

              (backing out)
          You know what? Actually, I think I should
          just take off. Let you gals enjoy your
          weekend...
Marin shoots her Mom a look. Help!

                    ERICA

          No, no, no. Don't be silly. Uh, look,
          here's what we'll do. Zoe and I will
          leave. We took a great walk on the beach,
          we'll go into town for lunch. You two
          stay. Harry, apologize about the near
          arrest.

                      HARRY

          No, you were impressive. Very strong,
          very... "macho".

                    ERICA

              (a little thrown)
          I don't think I was exactly "macho"

          ...


                    HARRY

          Trust me, if I ever catch a guy in
          his underwear in my refrigerator I
          hope I'm half the man you were, Mrs
          uh...




                                                        12.











                    ERICA

              (already hating him)
          Yeah. Okay. Whatever...
Marin watches. Dying.

                    HARRY

          All righty then...I'm definitely gonna
          hit the road.
              (salutes Erica and Zoe)
          Ladies...sensational meeting you.
              (then to Marin)
          Doll, call me.

                    ZOE

          Hold on. Hold on. Let's not get so
          dramatic here. What are we four
          teenagers? We're all sophisticated
          people. Why can't we all stay, for the
          weekend? Your mother's got work to do
          I've got papers to grade. You'll do your
          thing, whatever that is and if we want to
          hang together, we'll hang together. If we
          don't, we don't. There's no reason why
          any of us should give up this spectacular
          weekend.

                    MARIN

          Seriously. I can handle it.

                    ZOE

          I can totally handle it.

                    ERICA

              (on the spot)
          I mean, well, I can "handle" it...
The Women all look to Harry. He looks at Marin. She's hard to
resist.

                    HARRY

          It can only go up from here.

                                                   CUT TO:








HARRY AND MARIN

Walking past SHOPS on the MAIN DRAG IN EAST HAMPTON. They are
both licking ice cream cones. CAMERA STAYS BEHIND THEM.

                     Z


                     OE (V.O.)

          He's obviously a penis substitute.




                                                        13.














ERICA AND ZOE

Are paced 20 feet behind them, carrying groceries.

                    ZOE

          I mean a father substitute.

                    ERICA

          Except he's older than her father. I
          can't even look at them. What is she
          doing with a guy that age?

                    ZOE

          Marin was how old when you guys broke up?

                    ERICA

          Five years ago, so. ..twenty-three.

                    ZOE

          Okay, so she was old enough not to
          feel Dave was walking out on her.

                    ERICA

          Is that supposed to mean Dave walked out
          on me? Why do people assume when you
          break up after twenty years that the
          guy's the one who wanted out? Just
          because once we broke up he shtupped
          everything that moved...

                    ZOE

          Easy cowgirl. I didn't mean it that way.
          Just trying to figure out why such a
          smart girl is always with the wrong guy.







CLOSE ON A YOUNG FRENCH GIRL IN AN APRON


                    YOUNG FRENCH GIRL

          Mme. Barry, que je puis vous obtenir
          aujourd'hui?
The Girl stands BEHIND THE CHEESE COUNTER in:







THE BAREFOOT CONTESSA

A Gourmet Market in East Hampton. The clientele in here is as
rich looking as the food. Erica stands on the other side of
the Cheese Counter.

                    ERICA

          Bonjour je veux une partie de votre
          pate merveilleux et de votre
          meilleur fromage absolu de chevre.




                                                        14.










Harry and Marin shop near by. Harry listens to Erica out of
one ear.

                    HARRY

          That's impressive.

                    MARIN

          She started French lessons after she and
          my Dad split up. Part of her "Keep Busy,
          Don't Look Back" program. She's
          practically fluent now.

                    ERICA

              (turning back to Marin)
          Marin, au cas ou nous prende un desset ou
          devrions jefaire quelgue chose?

                    MARIN

              (with an impeccable
               accent)
          Laissons quelque chose d'achat. Et
          ce grand gateau de chocolat?

                    HARRY

          Hey, not bad.. .

                    MARIN

              (shrugs)
          Yeah...well. ..I am fluent. Be right
          back.
Marin crosses to the dessert counter. Erica turns back and
catches Harry checking out Marin's ass. He smiles as he licks
his ice cream. Erica rolls her eyes then spots another Older
Guy with a Leggy Girl twenty-five years his junior.

                    ERICA

          It's an epidemic.
Then Erica notices who's next to her at the cheese counter.
She sees her Sister, Zoe, reading a cheese label with her
glasses on and next to Zoe are two sad looking Old Women in
their Eighties with their arms linked. Almost woozy, Erica is
snapped out of it when she is handed her package.

                     Y


                     OUNG FRENCH GIRL

          Merci madame.
Erica heads down the aisle, passing Harry whose back is to
her. Just as she passes, he turns and almost bumps into her.

                    ERICA

              (backing off)
          Woops. Sorry.




                                                           15.











                      HARRY

          My fault.
They so very badly do not want to actually touch. Erica
hesitates. Harry gestures for her to go first then walks
alongside her.

                    ERICA

          So, Harry... What do you do?

                    HARRY

          I'm one of the owners of a record
          company among other things...

                    ERICA

          Oh, really? Which record company?

                    HARRY

          Drive by Records.

                    ERICA

              (appalled at the name)
          "Drive By" Records??? Is that a
          joke? What is that?

                    HARRY

          It's a Hip Hop label.

                    ERICA

          Hip Hop? Oh, rap? Oh, right. Well.
              (with disdain)
          Okay. That's... "interesting"...

                    HARRY

          Let me see if I get where you're
          headed here. . .

                    ERICA

          I'm sorry, but, look, you know I hate
          rap, I mean I do. It's sort of violent
          and crude for my taste, not to mention
          just a tad misogynistic.

                    HARRY

          Hey, a lot of people see rapping as
          poetry.

                    ERICA

          Yeah, but come on, how many words
          can you rhyme with 'Bitch'?
Erica places her groceries on the check out counter.

                    MARIN

              (joining Harry)
          How we doin?




                                                        16.











                    HARRY

          Should've left when she tried to arrest
          me.







INT. ERICA'S DINING ROOM - THAT NIGHT

Marin serves plates of pasta with lobster. Zoe pours wine and
Erica tosses a salad. Harry is the only one sitting.

                    MARIN

          So, Mom, how's the new play? You gettin'
          happy with it?
Marin places a plate in front of Harry then runs her finger
along "the nape of his neck. They smile at each other as she
continues on. Erica notices, tries not to respond.

                    ERICA

          Well, the thing with me is that I'm about
          90% hard word, 10% talent and so far the
          talent part hasn't exactly kicked in yet.

                    ZOE

          Yeah, right...

                    HARRY

          What's your play about?
Marin and Zoe stop what they are doing and turn to Erica.
She's hesitant to reveal this.

                    ERICA

          About? Well, I'm not exactly sure which
          is a bit of a problem, but so far it's
          about a divorced woman, a writer, she's
          this high strung, over-amped,
          controlling, know it all neurotic. . .
              (everyone stares at her)
          Who's incredibly cute and lovable.
              (more stares)
          It's a comedy.
              (takes a seat next to Zoe)

                    M

          So, how did you two meet?

                     ARIN

          At a Wine Auction at Sotheby's. Harry was
          the big buyer of the night.

                    HARRY

          I kept winking at Marin as she was
          conducting the auction and apparently
          every time I did that she misunderstood
          and I ended up buying cases of
          outrageously expensive wine.




                                                        17.










Zoe and Marin laugh.

                    ERICA

          Ever been married, Harry?

                    HARRY

          No. No, I haven't.

                    ERICA

          Wow. Now why do you think that is?

                    HARRY

          Some people just don't fit the mold. And
          so far...

                    ERICA

          Hey, if it ain't broke.

                       HARRY

          Exactly.
Harry leans back, places his arm around Marin's chair. Erica
takes note.

                    ZOE

          Wait a second, aren't you like a famous
          bachelor?

                    HARRY

          I wouldn't say I'm famous.

                    ZOE

          No, I think I read a piece on you
          in New York Magazine.

                    HARRY

          I guess people find it interesting
          that I've escaped the noose for so
          long.

                    ZOE

          Yeah, wasn't the name of the article,
          "The Escape Artist"?

                    ERICA

          Wait. I read that article. That was you?
          You were once engaged to somebody big.
          Who was it? Not Joan Collins.. .Wait.
          ..Carly Simon?

                    ZOE

          Yeah, it was somebody cool like that.
              (trying to remember)
          Not Martha Stewart....




                                                18.











                    MARIN

          You could just ..'ask him.

                    HARRY

          No, this is more fun. It's like I'm
          not here.

                    MARIN

          Harry was once engaged to Diane
          Sawyer. Okay?

                    ZOE

          Right. Diane Sawyer. I love her.

                    ERICA

              (stunned)
          I'm impressed.

                    HARRY

          Yeah, women your age love that
          about me.
Erica pauses on that one.

                    HARRY

              (trying to get thru this)
          You know what I mean.

                      ERICA

          Yes I do.

                     HARRY

          It's not a bad thing to say 'women
          your age'.

                    ERICA

          No...I'm sure it was a compliment.

                    HARRY

          It was. ..just the truth.

                    ZOE

              (stepping in)
          So when was this engagement?

                    HARRY

          Long time ago. She was just this
          adorable lanky girl from Kentucky
          with the greatest pair of legs I'd
          ever seen... Never understood her
          ending up with a job where she
          never showed them.
              (munches on his lobster)




                                      19.











          ERICA

You're not serious? She's Diane
Sawyer, she goes into caves in
Afghanistan with a shmahtah on her
head. Who cares about her legs?

          HARRY

Just anyone who's ever had the
pleasure of... You know what? I
hate to eat and run but...

          ZOE

No, wait. This is actually a very
fascinating dynamic - what's going
on at this table...

          MARIN

    (warning him)

Z

 oe teaches Women's Studies at
Columbia. . .

          HARRY

Oh, so this is gonna hurt.

          ZOE

No, come on, listen, here's the rub
for women. Look at what we have
here with you and Erica. Harry,
you've been around the block a few
times, right? You're what? Around
60, never been married, which, we
all know, if you were a woman,
would be a curse, you'd be an old
maid, a spinster, blah, blah,
blah... Okay, so instead of pitying
you, they write articles about you,
celebrate your never marrying, it
makes you illusive and ungettable.
You're a real catch. Then, take my
gorgeous sister here...

          ERICA

Any chance of you stopping here?

          ZOE

Come on, this is interesting. I
mean, look at her, she's so
accomplished, the most successful
woman playwright since who? Lillian
Hellman? She's over fifty,
divorced and still sits in night
after night because the available
guys her age want
    (to Marin)




                                                        20.

                     ZOE(cont'd)
           --forgive me honey for saying this,
           but they want girls that look like
           Marin so the whole over fifty
           dating scene is geared completely
           towards men leaving older women out
           and as a result that makes the
           older women more and more
           productive and more and more
           interesting, which, in turn, makes
           them even less desirable because as
           we all know -- men, especially
           older men, are threatened and
           deathly afraid of interesting and
           accomplished women. It's just so
           clear. Single older women, as a
           demographic, are as fucked a group
           as can ever exist.
Erica and Harry's EYES CONNECT for a millisecond. HEAR THE

SOUND OF PLATES CRASHING.








INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

OVER, we
Erica is cleaning up the broken plates, Zoe leans down to
help.

                     ERICA

           What are you, possessed? How could
           you say those things?

                     ZOE

           It just seemed so obvious to me. The
           injustice of it. Thank God men die
           younger than us. It's the only break we
           get.

                     ERICA

           Then you know what? Write a dissertation
           on it, don't announce to the world that I
           stay in night after night after night and
           by the way, one night after night would
           have been enough. Did you ever realize, I
           stay "in" as part of my job. Why do you
           think I married the director of my plays?
           He was the only man I ever saw. Anyway, I
           like staying in and I like this time in
           my life. Why do I have to defend myself?
M          I was married for 20 years. I'm done.
 arin ENTERS carrying more dishes.

                     MARIN

           What the hell was that?




                                            21.











           ZOE

I'm sorry, I thought I was onto
something.

          ERICA

Honey, what are you doing with this
guy? He's old, he's chauvinistic...

            MARIN

He's fun.

          ERICA

He's fun? How is he fun? He's
like.. .wrong.

          MARIN

Wrong can be fun, Mom.

          ERICA

Not this wrong.

          MARIN

Can we not do this now? He's
actually incredibly smart and
fascinating and if you had talked
to him about something other than
his marital status you would've
found out how smart he is. He owns
like 10 different companies...

          ERICA

What does that mean he owns ten
different companies? He can't
commit, that's what that means. Not
that, God forbid, I want him to
commit.

          MARIN

Yeah, that I get. Anyway, he said he
thought you two were very spontaneous and
nice and then said he's leaving as soon
as the sun comes up.

          ERICA

What? His car doesn't have
headlights?

          MARIN

Good night.

           ERICA

Wait. I have no right to get this
nuts.
     (hugs her)
He's your friend. Not mine. I love
you.




                                                         22.











                    MARIN

              (hugs her back)
          I love you more.
This is obviously a ritual between them. Erica kisses
Marin's cheek in a flutter of kisses, then Marin

EXITS.


                    ZOE

          No chance he said we were nice.

                    ERICA

          Please. None.
They HEAR MUSIC coming from Marin's bedroom.

                    ZOE

          What are they listening to?

                    ERICA

          I don't care...
              (listens)
          Oy. Marvin Gaye. . .
Erica turns on the garbage disposal. Zoe sings along,
"Let's get it on". .., Erica shoots her a look, turns
off the garbage disposal, doing the dishes with vigor.

                    ERICA

          I know she'll never see him after
          this weekend. She can't commit
          either.
Then they hear Marin GIGGLING.

                    ZOE

          He does sound fun.
Marin YELPS.

                    ZOE

          Admit it, he's got something. You
          felt it, right?
Then they hear Marin SCREAM.

                    ERICA

          Oh, this is nuts...
Erica covers her ears with her hands. Then they hear
Marin SCREAM "MOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!"

                    ERICA

          Did she say, Mom?




                                                        23.














INT. MARIN'S ROOM - ANGLE - THE DOOR

Erica and Zoe bust into the room and find Harry .on the
floor, leaning against the bed, a clenched fist on his chest.
His shirt is open, he's sweating, his complexion is grey.
Marin stands back, freaked out, afraid to get near him.

                      MARIN

           We were fooling around and he said he
           felt funny Hthen he just collapsed.

                      ARRY

               (out of breath)
           It's nothing. I'm okay maybe it was
           the lobster...

                     ERICA

           Does your chest hurt?

                     HARRY

           Like an elephant's standing on it.

                     ERICA

               (to Marin)
           Call 911...tell them to send an
           ambulance. . .
Marin hesitates.

                     ERICA

           Marin! Now!







HARRY'S POV - THE ROOM

Spinning. When he shuts his eyes, it goes BLACK. Spinning.
BLACK. Spinning. BLACK. He sees Marin, soft in the
background, on the phone and Erica coming toward him. He
hears Zoe:

                     ZOE(O.S.)

           What are you doing?

                     ERICA

               (coming closer)
           Mouth to mouth...

ON HARRY

Even in this state he gets that Erica is about to place her.
mouth on his. His eyes WIDEN IN HORROR, he reels back. Erica
catches this.

                     ERICA

           You fucking guy...




                                                        24.










She does it anyway. Her-mouth on his, her breath into his
lungs, over and over. Harry's eyes roll back in hi-so head.
As. Erica pounds on his chest, we HEAR THE BLARE OF A

SIREN...








AND A LOUD CLANG

As the DOORS to SOUTHAMPTON HOSPITAL FLY OPEN. Paramedics
WHEEL Harry through the corridors and into the ER with
dizzying speed. Two Nurses jostle Harry OFF the gurney and

ONTO A BED.

DR. JULIAN MERCER arrives at Harry's side. Julian is in his
early-thirties and has finally just graduated out of the 'you
look too young to be a doctor' syndrome. Julian is a man
whose goodness makes him sexy. He wears his hair shaggier
than you'd expect but then again, this is a Johns Hopkins
graduate who chose to live near the beach and work nights.
The Nurses place oxygen in Harry's nose, .;hook him up to a
heart monitor and connect him to an IV.

                    JULIAN

          How we doing here?

                    PARAMEDIC #1

          He's had 30 minutes of chest pain,
          nausea, shortness of breath, blood
          pressure's 170 over 100, pulse 104,
          respirations 18...

                     JULIAN

          Let's get an EKG. Mr. Langer, I'm
          Dr. Mercer. Are you in any pain
          right now?
The Nurse wheels over an EKG machine, Julian helps hook it
up.

                    HARRY

          Feel some pressure in my
          chest...it's real tight.

                    JULIAN

          Can you show me where the pain is?
Harry clenches his fist over his sternum.

                    JULIAN

          What were you doing at the onset of
          the pain?

                    HARRY

          I was uh, kissing a beautiful...




                                                        25.











                    JULIAN

              (watching the monitor)
          Where you having intercourse?

                    HARRY

          -- Unfortunately, no.

                    JULIAN


          S

           ense of humor in tact...
              (checks EKG)
          Hang a nitroglycerine drip. Mr.
          Langer the EKG shows you have a
          blocked artery which is not
          allowing enough oxygen to get to
          the heart muscle.. .

                    HARRY

          I'm having a heart attack?

                    JULIAN

          We're gonna stop it. But I need to
          know what kind of medications you
          take?

                    HARRY

              (scared shitless)
          I take uh... uh. . . Lipitor. . .

                    JULIAN

              (reading the EKG tape)
          Uh-huh... .Any thing else?

                    HARRY

          -- and a white one for blood
          pressure. . .

                       JULIAN

          procardia?

                       HARRY

          Yeah.

                    JULIAN

          What about, Viagra?
Erica, Marin and Zoe ARRIVE in the DOORWAY of the ER. Harry
eyes them...stalls.

                    JULIAN

          Mr. Langer? Did you take any Viagra
          today? Mr. Langer?

                    HARRY

          No. No Viagra.




                                                        26.











                    JULIAN

          You're positive?

                    HARRY

          I don't take Viagra. Don't need
          Viagra.
The Women grab looks at each other, know they shouldn't be
there. They turn away.

                    JULIAN

          Great. Just needed to be sure
          because I put nitroglycerin into
          your-drip and if you had taken
          Viagra, the combo would make your
          heart leap right out of your
          body...







CLOSE - HARRY'S EYES - PANICKED

As he watches the NITROGLYCERIN make it's way DOWN THE TUBE
and APPROACH HIS ARM. Just as the amber liquid is about to
enter his bloodstream he YANKS the IV out of his arm. The
drip is knocked onto the ground. The Women shriek as the
Nurses scurry to clean up. Erica and Zoe rush out, Marin
hangs back. Harry catches the look on her face.

                    JULIAN

          Let's give him an aspirin and
          Metoprolol 5mg...

                    HARRY

          Sorry, had an audience...
              (clutching his chest)

                    JULIAN

          It's okay. ..it was a great save.
              (to Nurse)
          Let's start the thrombolytic protocol.
          "4000 units of heparin. Mr. Langer, if
          this works and I have every reason to
          believe it will, it's going to reverse
          what's going on so there will be little
          or no damage to your heart. You with me?
              (Harry nods. Julian places
               his hand on Harry's)
          Okay, here we go.

THE HALLWAY

Marin paces, smoking. Erica sits. Zoe leans against the wall.

                    MARIN

          Oh, man, what if he doesn't make
          it? I don't know who to contact.




                                                           27.











                    MARIN (CONT'D)

          I don't know his family. I've gone
          out to dinner with the guy three
          times. I hardly know him.

                    ERICA

          He's gonna make it. Don't worry.

                    M

          He's like a bulldog. He'll make it.

                     ARIN

          This is a nightmare. I go out with
          a guy who's so old, he takes
          Viagra.

                    ERICA

          Are you nuts? You go out with a guy
          who's so old he's having a heart
          attack!

                    ZOE

          All I can say is, thank God it didn't
          happen when he was inside you. That could
          be life altering.
Julian rounds the corner of the corridor. Marin rushes toward
him, her face begging for good news.

                    JULIAN

          Your Dad's gonna be okay.

                    MARIN

          Oh, he's not my Dad...

                     JULIAN

          I'm sorry.
              (then)
          Your Grandad's gonna be okay.

                    MARIN

              (throws her arms around
               him)
          Oh, thank you so much. But he's not my...
          oh we're not related. He's just a friend.

                    JULIAN

          Sorry.
His sweet apologetic smile is not lost on Marin. Zoe and
Erica join them.

                    JULIAN

          I'm Dr. Mercer. Mr. Langer did have a
          mild heart attack. I gave him something
          to break up the clot in his artery and it
          worked beautifully.




                                                        28.











                    JULIAN (CONT'D)

          His EKG returned to normal almost
          immediately which means I don't expect
          any permanent damage. He's very lucky.

                    ERICA

              (shoulders sagging)
          Thank you. . .

                    JULIAN

          No, whoever got him here so fast should
          be thanked. Another half hour and I don't
          know if this would've worked.
Marin pats her Mom on the back.

                     ERICA

          Oh, man...
              (realizing it all now)
          This was...intense.
Erica wipes away a tear. Nothing could surprise her more.

                    JULIAN

          We're out of the woods. I've given him
          something to sleep, it might make him a
          little loopy at first but then it should
          knock him out.
              (to Erica)
          You're Mrs. Langer?

                    ERICA

          No, no I'm just... No. I'm Erica Barry. .
          He was having dinner at our house. I just
          met him this afternoon.

                    JULIAN

          You're Erica Barry?

                    ERICA

          Yes.

                    JULIAN

          The playwright?

                    ERICA

          Yes...

                    JULIAN

          What a pleasure. I'm a huge fan.
          Huge fan.

                    ERICA

          Really? Oh, thanks... This is my
          daughter, Marin, my sister, Zoe...




                                                        29.










Julian says Hi to each then returns his attention fully and
devotedly to Erica. Takes her in.

                    JULIAN

          Wow.







CLOSE - A JAPANESE TEA POT

Julian pours steaming hot tea into 3 paper cups.







MARIN - CLOSE

Sitting in the hospital corridor as JULIAN'S HAND ENTERS HER
FRAME and hands her a cup of tea. She looks up at him with
more adorableness than most men could handle. She blows on

                     M

the steam.

                     ARIN

          Thanks.
Camera Pans to ZOE. Sitting next to Marin. She is also handed
a Cup of Tea. Even she softens as she looks up at Julian.

                    ZOE

          Thank you Doctor.
This is all beginning to feel a little like the Step Sisters
trying on the Glass Slipper. Until we get to Erica, not
paying any attention at all as she is handed her Tea.

                    ERICA

          Oh. . .Hey. . .Ew. . .Hot. Thanks.

                    JULIAN

              (eyes on Erica)
          You're welcome. May I join you?

                    ERICA

          Yeah. Sure. This is very nice of
          you.

                    JULIAN

          First year of medical school you
          learn what can keep you up all
          night without making you nuts.
          Green Tea beats everything plus
          it's a great antioxidant. Cheers.

                    MARIN

              (turning on the charm)
          So, urn, do you always work nights?




                                                  30.











                    JULIAN

          Usually two or-three a week, gives
          me a chance for a real life during
          the day. . .
              (immediately turns back to
               Erica)
          You know, I heard you had a place
          in the Hamptons. I really am a very
          big fan. I honestly think I've seen
          every play you've ever written.

                    ERICA

          I think some were written before
          your time. There are some Marin's
          never even seen.

                    JULIAN

          No, I'm pretty sure I've seen them
          all and I saw the last one twice.
Zoe nudges Erica as a Nurse enters from the ER.

                    NURSE

          Doctor, we've got a walk in, may
          need stitches. . .

                    JULIAN

              (rises)
          I'll check on MI. Langer...if he's
          asleep; you all might want to get
          some shut eye and come back in the
          morning. Great to meet you Erica.
          Ladies. . .
The Women wave and watch him exit.
The second he's gone:

                    ERICA

              (to Marin)
          Okay, now that's a perfect a guy
          for you. He's adorable.

                    MARIN

          Mother! I've never seen a man less
          interested in me.

                    ZOE

          Or more interested in you.

                    ERICA

          Me? He's thirty years old.

                    MARIN

          No, he's older than that.




                                                        31.











                    ZOE

          Who cares how old, he is. I mean,
          he's not my type, he's like a
          gorgeous wholesome doctor but, he's
          perfect for you and hot for you,
          which makes him really perfect.

                    ERICA

          Stop it. He likes my work. Not me.
              (they just stare at her)
          It's insane. I would never.
              (off Zoe's look)
          Shut. Up.
Just then, Harry stumbles into the corridor in his Hospital

                     Z

Gown, pretty out of it.

                     OE

          Yuh-oh.

                    MARIN

              (rises)
          Harry....
Confused, Harry turns around, a little lost, giving the Women
a FULL VIEW OF HIS BARE ASS. The Women muffle screams.

                    MARIN

          Harry! Over here!
He faces them.

                    HARRY

          Honey, I want to go home. Can you
          call Lowell to pick me up?

                    MARIN

              (confused)
          Lowell?
Harry wobbles. Is he going to fall? Marin freezes, looks to
her Mom for help. Erica rushes to Harry.

                    ERICA

          Harry, you have to get back in bed.

                    HARRY

          Woman. And I say that as a
          compliment... You saved my life.
              (kisses her hand)
          Soft.. .
              ( then)
          I don't remember your name but I
          thank you from the bottom of my...




                                                        32.










He falls on Erica, totally out of it, his head on her breast,
his mouth open.

                    ERICA

              (afraid to breathe)
          Ugh. Look at this, even
          unconscious, he's a lech.
The Nurses rush out and peel Harry off Erica.

                    NURSE

          Mr. Langer, you shouldn't be
          standing.

                    HARRY

          Got to take a whiz girls.

                    NURSE

          We'll take care of that for you,
          Mr. Langer.
Harry turns back to the Women, smiling. He likes that idea.
LOVES that idea.

                    HARRY

          Okay. You take care of it for me,
          sweetheart. I'd like to see that...
As he walks away, his bare ass shines like a full moon in a
desert sky.

                    MARIN

          This is the most insane night of my
          life.

                    ZOE

          Yeah, but just admit that was one
          great ass for a guy that age.







CLOSE - A LARGE VASE OF YELLOW ROSES - 36 HOURS LATER

A Nurse slides the Roses down the counter of her station.

                    NURSE

          Now what can I do you for?
She looks across at a neat as a pin Man in his early forties,
Prada suit, crisp white shirt, dark tie. He's a Gershwin tune
of a man. A throwback to a kinder world. This is. LOWELL,
Harry's Houseman/Chef/all around Man Friday.

                    LOWELL

          I'm here for Mr. Harry Langer.
Julian ENTERS the Nurse's station.




                                                        33.











                    NURSE

              (to Julian)
          Are we discharging Hurricane Harry?

                    JULIAN

          Yes we are. Hi, I'm Dr. Mercer.
          Come on, I'll take you to him.
Julian EXITS the Nurse's Station. Lowell, carrying the
flowers, follows. He nods to TWO TALL LEGGY MINI SKIRTED
ASSISTANT TYPES, KIM and LEXI who follow. Both pack cell

                     J

phones, note pads, carry balloons, flowers and shopping bags.

                     ULIAN

          And you are. . ?

                    LOWELL

          Lowell St. James'. Mr. Langer's
          houseman, chef... general valet..

                    JULIAN

          Well that sounds like a pretty,
          interesting job.

                    LOWELL

          Fifteen years. Never a dull moment.
They arrive at:







A PRIVATE ROOM

where Harry lies on the bed, dressed and ready to go. He
squints as he reads a pamphlet at arms's distance called,
"Heart Attack -- Bouncing Back".

                    JULIAN

          Okay, Harry, looks like we're going
          to have to let you go.
Harry sits up too fast, lies right back down. Lowell looks
like he might cry. The Girls hold back.

                    HARRY

          Take it easy kids, I just sat up
          too fast. Doc, tell them. Am I in
          good shape? How were my tests this
          morning?

                    JULIAN

          He's doing extremely well.

                    LOWELL

              (holding back tears)
          Can I hug him?




                                                           34.











                    JULIAN

          Absolutely.
Harry stands and indulges Lowell in a deep hug. Lowell's
shoulders shake as he sobs.

                    HARRY

          Okay, Okay. Let's not get goofy. We
          got no thin , but good news here.

                    LOWELL

          I must say, you do look good...
          considering. You have a little
          extra baggage under your eyes, but
          I know how to fix that.

                    HARRY

              (to Julian)
          See what good hands I'm in. Did you
          meet my gorgeous assistants?

                    JULIAN

          Not formally.

                     HARRY

          Girls... .my Doctor, Julian Mercer.
              (then)
          Honey, did you bring the CDs?
Kim hands Harry a shopping bag full of CDs.

                    HARRY

              (to Julian)
          These are for you...
              (to the Girls)
          The man loves Hip Hop.

                    JULIAN

              (checking out the bag)
          Maybe not this much but...

                    HARRY

          And did you bring the other thing?
Lexi hands Harry another bag. Harry reaches in and pulls out
a small leather box, hands it to Julian.

                    HARRY

          This is just to thank you for your
          brilliance the other night. I hope
          it suits you.

                    JULIAN

              (opening the box)
          Wow. This is.. .Jesus, this is the
          most gorgeous watch I've ever seen.




                                                        35.











                    HARRY

          - Oh, good. It's a Piaget.
              (to Girls)
          He likes it.

                    JULIAN

          No, I love it and this is incredibly
          generous of you but I can't accept it.

                    HARRY

          You save my life and you end up
          with some CDs?

                    JULIAN

          No, I end up seeing you walk out of
          here and I do get paid you know -

                    MARIN (O.S.)

          -- Knock, knock.

T

 hey all turn, see Marin at the door. She waves to Harry,
more reserved than normal.

                    JULIAN

          Harry, I'll see you on the way out.

                    LOWELL

              (whispers)
          We'll pull up the car.
Everyone EXITS leaving Marin and Harry alone. Harry sits on
the bed. Marin joins him. Harry places his hand on her thigh.
All she notices is his hospital bracelet.

                    HARRY

          So, I'm some great date, huh?

                    MARIN

          Yeah... Mr. Excitement.

                    HARRY

          Tell me somethin', we haven't actually
          had sex yet, have we?

                    MARIN

          No we haven't. You're correct on
          that one.

                    HARRY

          Something to live for.
Marin smiles, kisses Harry on the cheek.




                                                        36.











                    HARRY

          Down to the cheek.
              (that's big, he digests
               that one)
          Come on, let's get outta here.







EXT. SOUTHAMPTON HOSPITAL - DAY

Harry is wheeled out in a wheelchair, Marin and a Nurse on
either side. In the parking lot is a Town Car with Lowell and
the Girls standing next to it. Next to them is Erica, waiting
by her car. She's on her cell phone. Harry spots them and
tries to get out of the wheel chair before it stops.

                    NURSE

          Hold on Tarzan, we're still movin' ...
              (she stops)
          Okay, now slow-ly.
To prove her wrong, Harry rises quickly. Everyone stands by,
ready to help.

                    HARRY

          Look at these faces. Will you tell them
          I'm fine.
As soon as Harry spots Erica, he starts to wobble.

                    ERICA

          Whoa! Whoa! WHOA!
Everyone grabs for Harry as he FALLS OUT OF FRAME AND THE

SCREEN GOES BLACK.








CLOSE ON JULIAN

taking Harry's pulse as Harry lies on the ASPHALT OF THE
HOSPITAL PARKING LOT. Lowell, the Two Assistants and Marin
huddle around. Erica steps back a bit.

                    JULIAN

          Harry, I'm sorry, but I think we jumped the
          gun.. .can't let you travel quite yet.

                    HARRY

          I ain't goin' back in there.

                    JULIAN

          You don't have to but I can't put you in
          a car right now and I can't leave you in
          the parking lot. I'd like you to stay
          nearby for a few days and let me keep an
          eye on you 'til you get your strength
          back.




                                                        37.











                    HARRY

          Doc, I'm out in the middle of the
          Hamptons. Where do you want me to go?
Marin turns to Erica who very clearly mouths, "FORGET IT!"







EXT. ERICA'S HOUSE - LATER THAT DAY.

The Town Car sits in the driveway, Lexi leans on the hood,
talking on her cell. A Market Delivery Van pulls away as a
Drugstore Delivery Van pulls in. A Flower Delivery KID
holding a large bouquet, knocks at the front door.

I





 NT. THE GUEST BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Harry sits up in bed wearing silk pajamas, holding an unlit
cigar, and is on the phone.
Zoe enters, placing the new bouquet on the already flower
filled dresser. Lowell lifts a LUNCH TRAY off the bed as Kim
stands nearby on the cell phone. Marin packs her bag.

                    HARRY

              (into phone)
          Just promise me you won't make a decision until
          we talk. Thinking about it ain't promising me.
          Okay, man, I'm seein' you Friday...
              (hangs up, then to Lowell)
          Lowell, what was that?

                    LOWELL

              (looking down at the Tray)
          Your lunch.

                    HARRY

          Somebody tell you to starve me to death?
Kim hands Harry the cell phone.

                     KIM

          Russell.

                    HARRY

              (into phone)
          Rush? No, man, you're livin' the shit.
          I just got a clean bill of health.
Kim hands Harry a NOTE that says:







          YOU HAVE TWO DINNER DATES THIS WEEK,


          SHOULD I CANCEL AND SEND FLOWERS?





                                                        38.










Harry steals a look at Marin, then nods to Kim.







INT. KITCHEN

Erica puts away groceries, a little on edge. Her back is to a
Man in his fifties, who sits at the island, eating a
sandwich. He wears sweats and a baseball cap. His natural
expression is -- worried. This is DAVE.

                    DAVE

          This is the best turkey sandwich I
          ever had in my life. What kind of
          mustard is this?

                    ERICA

              (not turning around)
          I don't know.

                    DAVE

          All right, don't get pissy. It's
          not Dijon, right?

                    ERICA

          Don't get pissy. ..you say that 'cause
          this, of course, would never happen to
          you. .1 come out here for peace and quiet
          and suddenly I'm a character in a Kaufman
          and Hart play.
              (the phone RINGS)
          And the phone does not stop.
              (phone STOPS RINGING)
          And it's never for me!
Lowell ENTERS with the Bed Tray.

                    LOWELL

          Sorry to interrupt.

                    ERICA

          That's fine Lowell, I'll take that.

                    LOWELL

          No, please, allow me.

                    ERICA

          No, no, I'll take it. No problem.
Erica takes the bed tray as Lowell EXITS.

                    ERICA

          The man does not know my name and
          I'm doing his dishes.
Lexi ENTERS, all 5'10" of her. Dave suddenly looks alive. She
carries an empty water glass.




                                                          39.











                    LEX

          Hi Erica. Um...where should I put

                    E

          this?

                     RICA

          Right here. I'll take it.

                    LEXI

          And Harry has a headache. Do you
          have any Tylenol?

                    ERICA

          Tylenol yes. ..
              (reaches in cabinet)

                     LEXI

              (extends her hand to Dave)
          Hi. I'm Lexi, Harry's second
          assistant.

                    DAVE

          Hey...Dave Klein. How ya doin'?
Erica hands Lexi the Tylenol, she thanks her and EXITS.

                    ERICA

              (holding the water glass)
          Where should I put this? It's an
          empty water glass. What are the
          choices?

                    DAVE

              (rises)
          I'm gettin' outta your hair.

                       ERICA

          Thank you.

                    DAVE

          So you're not ready to show me any
          pages? I'm not putting pressure on
          you, I'm just asking.

                    ERICA

          I haven't written a word. I'm on
          page twelve and the first eleven
          pages stink.

                      DAVE

          So you have one good page.
               (then)
          How tall do you think that girl
          was?
Before Erica can respond, Marin ENTERS.




                                                        40.











                    MARIN

          Dad! I didn't know you were here.

                    DAVE

          I'm just on my way out, bubbee.

                    MARIN

          Well, I was just gonna drive into the
          city with Zoe but if you're driving back,
          I'd much rather go with you.

                    DAVE

          I have to meet someone before I go...

                    ERICA

              (to Marin)
          Wait wait wait wait. You're leaving, Zoe's
          leaving, the entourage is leaving. And I'm
          supposed to stay here with him alone?

                    MARIN

          The doctor said" he's 'sending over
          a Nurse in the morning...

                       ERICA

          The morning? That's nineteen hours from
          now...
                 (takes a deep breath)
          Okay, I can handle this. I'm just going
          to get into a zen' place, play music,
          cook, write, focus...

                    DAVE

          She never changes...

                    ERICA

              (setting him straight)
          Yes. Maybe that's a good thing.







EXT. ERICA'S HOUSE - SUNSET

No cars are out front. Quiet and peaceful. On the Soundtrack
we hear the French tune, I wish You Love sung in French.







INT. ERICA'S KITCHEN - THE SAME TIME - MUSIC OVER

Erica cooks, softly singing along in French.

                    HARRY (O.S.)

          Smells great in here.
Surprised, Erica turns to find Harry leaning in the doorway
in his pajamas, robe and slippers. No one's ever had more
gorgeous clothes to sleep in. His presence disarms her.




                                                        41.











                    ERICA

          Coq au Vin...
              (he looks confused)

                    H

          Chicken cooked in red wine...

                     ARRY

          French Food... French music...

                    ERICA

          Part of my play takes place in Paris so
          I'm hoping this helps me think. I'm
          hopin'...How you feeling?

                    HARRY

          Well, I walked all the way in here,
          only bumping into two chairs and an
          ottoman.

                    ERICA

          Everyone bumps into that ottoman.
Harry appreciates the thought. Before it has time to become
awkward, the Phone RINGS.

                    HARRY

          Hey, thanks for letting me...

                    ERICA

          Yeah, no...it's fine.
              (answering the phone)
          Hello. Yes, he is.
              (hands the phone to Harry)

                    HARRY

              (into phone)
          Hello. Hey sweets...
              (Erica hates this)
          Oh, you got the flowers? Are they
          pretty?
Erica can't stand this. She puts on her glasses and skims her
recipe.

                    HARRY

          Hey, can I call you in a little
          bit. What's your number doll?
              (spots a pad and pencil)
Harry squints, can't see what he's writing...backs his head
away from the pad. Erica hands him her glasses.

                    HARRY

              (slips them on, jots down
               the number)
          Okay... Call you in a little.




                                                          42.










Harry hangs up and hands the glasses back to Erica.

                    HARRY

          Same prescription...

                    ERICA

          Look, Harry, it's not like in any stretch
          of the imagination, I think you're all
          that right for my daughter but I don't
          really appreciate hearing you on the
          phone with other women. It's like I'm an
          accomplice to you cheating, it's...

                    HARRY

          Your daughter knows I see other women.

                    ERICA

          She does? I mean, fine, it's none
          of my business...but...
              (struggles to open a
               bottle of wine)

                    HARRY

          She knows I'm not monogamous...We've
          discussed it.

                    ERICA

          Great? And that's what? Why are you
          proud of that?

                    HARRY

          Not proud. Just honest. Your daughter
          said she likes that about me.
              (takes the wine and opens
               it with ease.)

                    ERICA

          My daughter is confused when it comes to men.

                    HARRY

          I don't blame her. We're confusing.
Harry hands her the open wine bottle.







EXT. BEACH PATIO








WIDE SHOT - ALMOST NIGHT

Erica and Harry sit not so close together at a long table,
under a purple sky. Another French Tune plays. If this wasn't
them, this would look romantic.

N

 othing is said. Just two people eating. Harry lifts the salt
shaker, about to add salt to his chicken.




                                                        43.











                    ERICA

          Should I just call the ambulance now?
Harry shoots her a look and places the salt shaker back on the
table.







EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT - OVER - LOUIS ARMSTRONG'S LA VIE EN ROSE

A starry sky gives the house a storybook setting. We HEAR THE

PHONE RING.








INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME - MUSIC CONTINUES

Erica works at a laptop at a cluttered table. The CLOCK tells us
it's a little after ONE A.M. Annoyed by the ringing phone, she
points her remote at the CD Player and stops' the song. Harry
answers the phone in his room. A moment of quiet. Erica points her
remote, starts the song again, starts typing again. Now the other
line RINGS. She looks over at the phone watching one RED LIGHT
"BLINK, while the other line is answered.

                    ERICA

          What am I doing?
She throws a piece of paper over the phone so she can't see it.
She clicks on her AOL ICON and is told: AOL CANNOT CONNECT. LINE
BUSY. She's pissed. Then, worse, she SMELLS something.







INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Harry is on the phone, smoking a cigar. His pajama top is
unbuttoned, his hair is allover the place. His bed is a mess,
laptop open, newspapers spilling onto the floor. Erica stands
in the doorway. He quickly hides his cigar.

                     HARRY

               (into phone)
          Can you hold a see, doll?
               (looks to Erica)
          Hey.

                     ERICA

          Okay, here's the thing. I really don't
          want to play the part of the uptight
          Nurse to your bad boy patient. If you
          want to have another heart attack, go
          ahead, it's your life but I have work to
          do and I don't have time to make another
          run to the hospital because you're
          filling your already clogged arteries
          with smoke but more importantly, I'd
          rather not have my house smell like a
          pool hall.




                                                        44.










Erica holds out a partially filled water glass for Harry to
deposit his cigar in.

                    HARRY

          I have a question for you.
She waits. She doesn't say anything.

                     ERICA

          What? Do I Hhave to say what?

                     ARRY

          Have you always been like this or
          do I bring this out in you?
She shakes the water glass, waiting for the deposit. He drops
the cigar in.

                    HARRY

          I don't think I've ever had this
          effect on a woman before.

                    ERICA

              (picking up the
               newspapers)
          And what effect do you think you're
          having on me?

                    HARRY

          I don't quite recognize it, that's how I
          know I've never had it before.
Erica rolls her eyes as she finishes cleaning up.

                    HARRY

          So you don't sleep?

                    ERICA

          I only need about four hours a night.

                    HARRY

          Me too. Never slept eight hours in my
          life.

                    ERICA

          Me either. I wish I could. ..but...
              (re: curtains)
          Want me to shut these, sun comes in
          pretty strong in the morning.

                    HARRY

          Sure. . . thanks. . .

                    ERICA

              (drawing the drapes)
          Who you talking to at this hour?




                                                        45.











                    HARRY

          A friend in L.A. It's only ten out there.

                    ERICA

          And that's not past her bedtime?

                    HARRY

          So you don't get more mellow as the hours
          pass?

                    ERICA

              (heading out)
          Good night, Harry.

                    HARRY

          Can I ask you one other thing?
              (Erica turns)
          What's with the turtlenecks? It's
          the middle of summer.

                    ERICA

          Now seriously, why do you care what I
          wear?

                    HARRY

          Just curious.

                    ERICA

          I like them. I've always liked them. I'm
          just a turtleneck kinda gal.

                    HARRY

          You ever get hot?

                    ERICA

          No.

                    HARRY

          Never?

                    ERICA

          Not lately.







INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Almost TWO. Erica is writing, her eyes go to the phone with
the typing paper over it. She LIFTS a corner of the paper,
takes a peek. The one lit line GOES OUT. Finally. "Erica
turns off her computer, sits for a second. No one has rattled
her cage like this in quite some time. And no, she doesn't
like it. She stands, starts to undress.

ANGLE - THE FLOOR





                                                        46.










As Erica's TURTLENECK lands on it. Then her BRA, then her
PANTS then her PANTIES.

ERICA - NAKED - TIGHT SHOT

She crosses through the room on her way to the Bathroom. She
passes by her partially open door, happens to look out INTO

THE HALLWAY AND SEES:


HARRY - PLANTED RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER

Seeing it all.

ERICA - SCREAMS

and DROPS OUT OF FRAME.

HARRY

flustered, spins around, loses his balance, crashes into the
wall, covers his eyes.

                    HARRY

          I'm sorry! Oh, God am I sorry.

                    ERICA (O.S.)

          What are you doing?!?

                    HARRY

          Trying to find the kitchen!

                    ERICA (O.S.)

          Back here???

                    HARRY

          I-I got confused..! It was dark. I didn't
          really see anything. Just your tits and a
          little of your-
Erica SLAMS HER DOOR. Photos on the wall shake.

                    HARRY

          This is gonna be murder.







INT. LIVING ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

A very wide MIDDLE AGED NURSE gruffly crosses thru the room
toward the Front Door. Just as she opens the door, Erica
ENTERS in hat, sunglasses, turtleneck, long skirt. Pretty
much no skin is showing whatsoever. She carries a few
packages.

                    NURSE

          Good bye Mrs. Barry.




                                                        47.











                    ERICA

          Good bye? You're leaving? That's
          not good.

                    NURSE

          Been fired.

                     ERICA

          Fired?   You just started.

                    HARRY

          Not fired darlin'. Just not needed.
Erica hardly looks at You Know Who who appears to be fresh
out of the shower, wet hair, silk robe, bare chest and legs.

                    ERICA

          What do you mean, not needed? Of
          course we need her. She's gonna
          take care of you and feed you and...

                    HARRY

          -- No, no, I'm actually feeling
          pretty perky today. Making quite a
          recovery. . .
              (opening the screen door)
          Sorry for the trouble Mrs.
          Gimble... Take care, dear.
Harry hands her a wad of bills like she's a Maitre'd. Mrs.
Gimble gives Erica a look of pity as she exits. Erica, now
alone with Harry, self-consciously adjusts her sunglasses.
Harry, on the other hand, slips his hand onto his bare chest,
pats it.

                    HARRY

          Listen, about last night.

                    ERICA

          Yeah. How 'bout we never talk about that?
              (hands him some pills)
          I was at the drugstore. Your
          prescriptions were ready. They said take
          these two with food and this one without.

                    HARRY

          Honestly, you were in silhouette.

                    ERICA

          I think that's talkin' about it.

                    HARRY

          I really didn't see all that much.




                                                        48.











                    ERICA

              (heading toward her room)
          Yip. There you go.

                    HARRY

          Okay. Won't mention it again but...

                    ERICA

              (almost out of the room)
          Goin' to work, Harry.

                    HARRY

              (yells)
          You saw my ass, you don't see me
          acting nuts, wearing hats and
          glasses and weird get ups...
The Sound of a DOOR SLAM. - Harry flinches.







INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM

Harry and Julian sit on the bed. Julian takes Harry's blood
pressure.

                    HARRY

          Yes or no. What's the deal, can I
          go?

                    JULIAN

          You still getting dizzy?

                    HARRY

          Not as much.

                    JULIAN

          Out of breath?

                    HARRY

          Only sometimes.

                    JULIAN

              (listens with stethoscope)
          How's Erica treating you?

                       HARRY

          Who?

                     JULIAN

              (nods toward Living Room)
          Erica. . .

                    HARRY

          Her? Oh, she's a major piece of
          work. The woman wears turtlenecks
          in the middle of the summer.




                                                      49.











                    HARRY (CONT'D)

          She's beyond uptight. Almost makes
          her fun to be around.

                    JULIAN

          Uptight? That's funny. I haven't
          noticed that.

                    HARRY

          Try livin' with her.
Julian takes Harry's pulse.

                    HARRY

              (with secret glee)
          I actually saw her naked last
          night.

                    JULIAN

          That doesn't sound so uptight.

                    HARRY

          It was an accident. She thought I
          was asleep, I thought her room was
          the kitchen.

                    JULIAN

          You know what Freud said - there
          are no accidents.

                    HARRY

          Trust me. This was an accident. Although,
          why would she be walking around naked
          when she knows I'm 20 feet away.

                    JULIAN

          Why would you think her bedroom was
          the kitchen?

                    HARRY

          It was dark, it was two in the
          morning.

                    JULIAN

          That could explain why she was walking
          around naked. Deep breath...

                    HARRY

          You know I've never seen a woman
          that age naked before.

                    JULIAN

          You're kidding?

                    HARRY

          Hey, we're not all doctors.




                                                        50.











                    JULIAN

          Well, I think she's very beautiful
          and she's a fantastic writer, you
          know.

                    HARRY

          No, I don't know...

                    JULIAN

          Erica Barry? She's pretty major.
              (writing a prescription)
          So, you date her daughter?

                     HARRY

          Okay, now she's a great chick. Must take
          after the father. Which reminds me...Doc,
          what (about Mr. Midnight here. . ?
                indicates his dick)
          When can I be up and running in
          that department?

                    JULIAN

          I think Mr. Midnight needs to stay
          put for another couple of weeks.

                    HARRY

          But it won't kill me when I do it, right?

                    JULIAN

          It's exercise. It'll be good for you. And
          just so you know, I'm told after a heart
          attack, if you can climb a flight of
          stairs, you can have sex.

                                                  CUT TO:








A LOW ANGLE OF A STAIRCASE

Which goes from the beach up to Erica's deck. Harry stands at
the bottom of the stairs in his robe, velvet slippers and
sunglasses.' He looks up to the top of the stairs as if it's
Mt. Everest. Bravely, he climbs the first few steps. Not bad.
After two more, he's out of breath. Determined, he holds onto
the railing and drags himself up to the next step. Happy with
himself, he holds on for dear life and drags himself up one
more...and then, he's so out of breath, he can barely move,
yet he reaches up the railing and tries to hike himself up
one more.







INT . KITCHEN - SAME TIME

The tea kettle WHISTLES as Erica and Julian stand on either
side of her island. Erica reaches for a tea bag.




                                                        51.











                    ERICA

          So, you're saying, he's not ready
          to travel at all? Not even by
          plane? Train?

                    JULIAN

          I don't think so...
              (sees her disappointment)
          It's been tough, huh?

                    ERICA

          Well, he fired the Nurse after an
          hour, now says he doesn't need one.
          He's a bit of a workout.. .yeah.

                    JULIAN

          How are you holding up?

                    ERICA

          Oh, fine. .I'm fine, I'm...

                    JULIAN

          One more fine and I won't believe you.
The Phone RINGS.

                    ERICA

          Oh, shoot, hold on...
              (into phone)
          Hello. Hey...Oh, hi...







ANGLE - JULIAN

Smitten. Just something about her. Watching her.







ANGLE - ERICA

Not noticing, pouring water for her tea.

                    ERICA

              (into phone)
          No, I'm finally getting to it...
Erica sees Julian sliding a slip of paper over to her. Looks
over at it. It's a piece of paper from his prescription pad.
On it is written...Have dinner with me tonight? Erica looks
up at him. Stunned. J

                     ULIAN

              (heading out)
          Pick you up around seven?

                    ERICA

          W-What about the patient?




                                                          52.











                    JULIAN

          Like he said, he doesn't need a
          nurse.
We begin to hear strains of another French song.







INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON - MUSIC OVER

Erica at her desk, typing. The Music plays from the CD
player. As much as she doesn't want it to be true, this
attention from Julian has fueled her.







THE LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME - MUSIC OVER

Harry, dressed for the first time, wearing khaki's and a
summer shirt, strolls through the Living Room a bit cautious.

                    HARRY

              (yells, warning-like)
          I'm Walking Around The house!
ERICA Laughs. Even she knows this is funny. Harry arrives at
her open doorway, timidly pokes his head in.

                    ERICA

          Listen, I've decided to get over the
          whole "you saw me naked" thing. So, we
          don't have to deal with it anymore. Okay?

                    HARRY

          Good, 'cause I've been hiding from
          you all day.

                    ERICA

          I know. You want to come in?

                    HARRY

          I don't want to break your rhythm
          or anything.

                    ERICA

          That would be wishful thinking.
Harry ENTERS cautiously and curiously.

                    HARRY

          Beautiful painting. So I'm gonna
          venture out there and go for a
          short walk...

                    ERICA

          You up to that?




                                                        53.











                    HARRY

          My doctor recommended it. I gotta
          build up to stairs and stuff like
          that. You wouldn't want to join me?

                    ERICA

          That means you don't want me to?

                    HARRY

          No, I was asking if you wanted to.

                    ERICA

          Oh, well, I would but...I don't
          usually like to break once I've
          started writing so I probably
          shouldn't, not that a little fresh
          air would hurt but...

                    HARRY

          It's just a walk Erica, not a
          marriage proposal.

                    ERICA

          You know my name.

                    HARRY

          Erica Jane Barry. I looked you up
          on the internet.







EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS LATER - LATE .IN THE DAY

Erica and Harry walk by the water's edge. They are the only
two people on the beach.

                    HARRY

          -- Did you know there are over eight
          thousand websites that mention you?

                    ERICA

          That can't be possible.

                    HARRY

          No, it's true. I know everything
          about you now. And not because of
          last night, but...

                    E


                     RICA

          Yeah, I understood. I actually
          looked you up too. You grew up in
          L.A., which I thought nobody did.




                                                         54.











                    ERICA (CONT'D)

          You were the road manager for a group I
          sorta never heard of, started your own
          record label at 29, sold it at 45, then
          started buying and selling boutique
          companies then invested in a small record
          company which you turned into the 2nd
          largest Hip Hop label in the world.

                    HARRY

          It's exhausting just hearing about it.

                    ERICA

          I know, but the truth is, it goes
          fast doesn't it?

                    HARRY

          Like the blink of an eye.
Erica bends down and picks up A FLAT WHITE STONE, then
another and another...

                    HARRY

          I noticed you have bowls of those
          all over your house.

                    ERICA

          I know, I'm crazy, I just think
          they're so beautiful...

                    HARRY

          But why do you only pick up the white
          ones?

                    ERICA

          I don't only pick up the white ones.

                    HARRY

          Oh, so you really are crazy.

                    ERICA

          I pick up only the white ones?
              (looks in her hand)
          Oh, God, what does that mean? I'm
          controlling, unadventurous, what?

                    HARRY

          So you're as hard on yourself as
          you are on everyone else.
Erica is stunned that he caught on to that. Harry bends down,
picks up a BROWN stone, places it in her palm among the white
stones.

                    HARRY

          Something to remember me by.




                                                        55.










Erica realizes she can't sum this guy up so easily or at all.

                    ERICA

          So can I ask you something Harry? What's
          with all the young girls? I mean, what's
          the story there, really?

                    HARRY

          I just like to travel light.

                    ERICA

          You just like to travel light? Oh,
          please, what the hell does that mean?

                    HARRY

          Now see a thirty year old gets that.

                    ERICA

          You mean falls for that.

                    HARRY

          I mean, accepts it.

                    ERICA

          If that's what you want... a non
          threatening woman, who won't get your
          number, you get to run the show...

                    HARRY

          I think our relationship is growing
          by the way. Have you noticed?
There he goes again. She can't believe he's cute like this.

                    HARRY

          I'm serious. Maybe we just needed to get
          out of the house. Now, you may notice,
          interestingly, we're walking back toward
          the house and its getting a little rocky
          again.

                    ERICA

          Of course it's getting a little
          rocky, we're talking about you.

                    HARRY

          See, I'll accept that slight
          hostility because I'm enjoying your
          company so much.

T

 hey're reached the bottom of the beach stairs. Harry looks
up, daunted.

                      ERICA

          You okay?




                                                           56.











                    HARRY

          Yeah, but I think I'11 stay down here and
          watch the sunset. You interested?
Erica checks her watch.

                    HARRY

          Big dinner date?

                    ERICA

          Well, yeah, as a matter of fact.
          With your doctor.

                    HARRY

          Ohhhhh, my doctor, 'cause he's not
          too young for you, huh?

                    ERICA

          No, he's totally too young for me.
          But we're just having dinner. It's
          not a date.

                    HARRY

          Does he know that?

                    ERICA

          Well, I'll tell him, but I doubt
          that he thinks of it that way.

                    HARRY

          I doubt that you doubt that. Anyway, you
          may like it. Think of it this way -- he's
          not threatening, won't get your number,
          you get to run the show. You might have a
          hell of a time.
Over, we HEAR, DING DONG.







THAT NIGHT - THE FRONT DOOR - SWINGS OPEN

And we find Julian. Looking just as any girl would hope.
Dream Date.

AND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR

is Harry, in his robe and PJ's.

                    JULIAN

          Hey, look who's answering the door.

                    HARRY

          And look who's at the door.

                    JULIAN

          Brought you something.




                                                        57.










Julian hands him a take-out food box.

                     JULIAN

          A heart healthy dinner from our
          cafeteria.

                       ERICA (O.S.)

          Hello...
Both guys turn at once. She looks beautiful, wearing a dress,
probably the sexiest one she owns. No turtleneck tonight.
Julian walks to her, kisses her on the cheek.

                    JULIAN

          You look beautiful.

                       ERICA

          Thank you.
Behind Julian's back Harry gives Erica the 'OK' sign.

                    ERICA

              (thrown)
          We ready..?

                    JULIAN

          Let me just see how Harry's doing.
          It'll take two seconds. Har, have a
          seat. .







ANGLE - HARRY

sitting, self-conscious in his new role - The Sick One.
Julian takes his wrist, feels his pulse. Harry looks straight
ahead.







WHAT HE SEES - ERICA'S LEGS

as she sits right in front of him. She crosses her legs and
her dress hikes up a little, exposing her thigh.
JULIAN furrows his brow.

                    HARRY

          What? That's not the face you want
          to see your doctor making.

                     JULIAN

          Your pulse is a little fast but
          maybe you're just excited about
          something.
Harry LOOKS AT ERICA'S LEGS again.




                                                         58.











                    HARRY

              (quickly)
          I don't think so. I'm not excited
          about anything.
Erica shifts, the hem of her skirt RISING even higher.

                    JULIAN

          There it goes again. Racing.

                    HARRY

          Doc... Impossible!
Erica rises, leaving Harry's eye-line.

                    JULIAN

          Oh, there we go, now I feel better.
          Back to normal.
Harry winces then rises, looks to Erica as she throws a
pashmina over her shoulders in SLOW MOTION. Harry rushes them

OUT THE DOOR.


                    HARRY

          Okay, all right, good, have fun, don't
          rush back for me and don't do anything I
          wouldn't do.

                    ERICA

          Well that wouldn't leave us too
          many options would it?

                    HARRY

          And do we wonder how she writes
          that snappy repartee.
              (whispers to Erica)
          Let him pick up the check. It'll
          make him feel older.
On Erica's shocked expression, the DOOR SLAMS.







INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT - A BEN WEBSTER CD PLAYS

Harry lies on the sofa. CAMERA MOVES UP Harry's body, past
the hospital take out carton on his stomach and finally up to

                     M

his face. As the CAMERA moves we HEAR:

                     ARIN (O.S.)

          Hi, it's Marin, I'm not in so leave
          a message and I'll call you back.

                    HARRY

          Hey, it's me...just sitting around
          looking at your baby pictures...
          Thinking about you...




                                                          59.










He hangs up, dials another number.

                    ANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

          Hi and HI, you've reached Brooke and
          Shannon. For Brooke push one, for -
Harry hangs up then slowly sits up, letting himself feel as
funky as he wants.

                    HARRY

          Everybody's out but old Har.. .Old, old
          old old Har...
Harry rises dizzily, crosses to the bookshelves. He rummages
around, finds ERICA'S SCRAPBOOK, pulls it out, randomly opens
it, finds a photo of Erica in the 70's, wearing a turtleneck.
Harry smiles.







INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Harry wanders in with the scrapbook tucked under his arm. He
notices a bowl filled with white beach stones. Harry's brown
stone sits at the top of the pile.

                    HARRY

              (complimented)
          Top of the heap...

CLOSE ON JULIAN

Staring at Erica. He can't get enough of her. They're in a
ROMANTIC SEASIDE RESTAURANT. And Erica's blushing for the
first time in twenty-five years.

                    ERICA

          -- So, when the land came up, I snatched it
          and the house was built in record time and...
              (blushing to death)
          It's like a thousand degrees in here.

                    JULIAN

          You know, they say doctors fall for
          people who need rescuing, that we have a
          need to take care of someone.

                    ERICA

          Really? I never heard that one.
              (starts fanning herself
               with the menu)
          Julian, how old are you, like...

                    JULIAN

          -- Thirty-three.




                                              60.











          ERICA

Thirty-three.-Okay, so, I'm twenty years
older than you. More than twenty years
older than you.

          JULIAN

You look fabulous.

            ERICA

Thank you   but you know, I'm not sure
where you   were headed with that thing you
were just   saying, but in terms of us, you
just want   to be friends, right?

          JULIAN

Honestly? No.

          ERICA

Well, then, what is it that you...
want to be?

          J


           ULIAN

I think I'd embarrass you if I told
you.

          ERICA

I was embarrassed just getting
dressed to see you.

          JULIAN

This may surprise you but some
women consider me quite the guy.
I've never been married. I'm a
doctor. You wouldn't believe what
catnip that is for some women.

          ERICA

Oh yes I would. But, you don't like
girls your own age?

          JULIAN

I do very much. But I've never met one
I've taken to quite like this and when
something happens to you that's never
happened to you before, don't you have to
at least find out what it is?

          ERICA

I suppose but, see, I don't date
all that much or all that well...

          JULIAN

Oh, come on, you must beat them
away with a stick.




                                                          61.











                    ERICA

          Now you're kidding, right? No, guys
          my age, the ones I've met...well,
          I'm not that regular a person and
          they really like regular.

                    JULIAN

          Men your age may be really stupid,
          you ever think of that?
              (takes her hand)

                    ERICA

          Yes I have. Many times.

                    JULIAN

              (looks from her hand to
               her eyes)
          There's something radically wrong with
          the idea that no one loves you.
Ow. Right to the middle of her shoulder, then her neck.
Julian kisses her palm, then her.

                    JULIAN

          I knew you'd smell good.

                    ERICA

          It's just...soap...

                    JULIAN

          How much is soap that smells like this?

                    ERICA

          I don't know. I got it at the market.

                    JULIAN

          Erica, you're incredibly sexy.

                    ERICA

          No, swear to God, I'm not...







MEANWHILE, HARRY IS SOUND ASLEEP ON ERICA'S BED

Her scrapbook open against his chest. We HEAR the SOUND OF
ACAR pulling up to the house. Harry wakes up. Oh shit.   He
leaps out of bed, this is the fastest he's moved in days. A
bit disoriented, he straightens the covers, looks around for
other evidence then hightails it out of there.







INT. LIVING ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

Erica enters, letting out a huge sigh. She's brought back to
reality when she hears the TV in Harry's room. She heads his
way, then changes her mind and stops.




                                                        62.











                    ERICA

              (yells)
          I'm back...

                    HARRY (O.S.)

          You have fun?

                    ERICA

          It was interesting. So... Good night.







INT. HARRY'S ROOM - SAME TIME

Harry's in bed, clearly disappointed that she didn't stop in.

                    HARRY

              (yells)
          'Night...







INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - LATER

Erica, in pj's and glasses, sits at her laptop, writing. She
hears the CHIME of someone INSTANT MESSENGERING HER. It a
message from HARRYL37. It says: What R U doing?

W

 e go BACK AND FORTH between their TWO ROOMS.
She answers: Writing. Hi. What R U doing?
He writes: Watching Joan Rivers sell jewelry.
Erica laughs when he adds: So was your date a date?
She types: I think so...
He types: I told ya. (then) You hungry?
Surprised, she types: I just had dinner.
He writes: Yeah, but women never eat on dates.

                    ERICA

              (to herself)
          How does he know everything!
She hesitates then types: Actually am a little hungry but,
I'm in my pjs.
He writes: Me too. Pajama party?
SHE stares at the screen biting her lip. HE does the same.




                                                        63.










Erica rises, LOOKS IN THE MIRROR, checks out her boobs in her
pajamas. They look so low. She opens a drawer, rifles through it,
takes out a bra, takes out a better bra.
IN HIS BATHROOM, Harry fixes his hair, tries to make more of it
than he has.
Erica now wearing a bra under he pajamas, checks out her boobs
again. Better. She adjusts the straps. Lifts them higher.







INT. LIVING ROOM

Erica and Harry ENTER FROM OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE ROOM, both in
their pajamas.

                    HARRY

          We are cute...

                    ERICA

          This is pretty unusual for me.   I'm not
          used to having sleepovers.

                       HARRY

          Me either.

                    ERICA

          Really? With your social life?

                    HARRY

          My, dear, you are confusing sex with sleeping.
          Sleeping is something I prefer to do alone.

                    ERICA

          Okay, good to know.
              (heading for the kitchen)
          So, what are you hungry for?

                    HARRY

              (joining her)
          What are my choices? I mean I know you
          think I'm not very discriminating but...
She looks through the fridge.

                    ERICA

          Oh, God, what's the difference what I
          think. I can't imagine what you think of
          me. Okay, so... Pasta, left over coq au
          vin, turkey sandwich or grilled cheese.

                       HARRY

          Pancakes.

                    ERICA

          Totally what I wanted. Blueberries?




                                                      64.











                    HARRY

          You ever miss being married? I bet you
          were great at it.

                    ERICA

          Sometimes I miss it. At night.. But not
          that much anymore. Was one of us just
          saying something interesting?

                    HARRY

          You said you can't imagine what I think
          of you.

                    ERICA

          Oh, right, but you don't have to answer
          that.

                    HARRY

          Okay.

                    ERICA

          I mean, if you had an opinion, I'd be
          curious but...'

                    HARRY

          will you tell me first why you only
          miss being married at night?

                    ERICA

              (cracking eggs)
          Oh, 'cause the phone doesn't ring as much
          at night and the "alone" thing happens at
          night and sleeping by myself took some
          getting used to. But I got the hang of
          it. You gotta sleep in the middle of the
          bed. It's absolutely not healthy to have
          a side when no one has the other side.
She starts mixing the batter.

                    HARRY

          Okay, now I'm convinced what I
          think of you is right.
              (Erica waits. . . )
          You are a tower of strength.

                    ERICA

              (shoulders sagging)
          Ughhhhhhhhhh... .

                    HARRY

          Try not to rate my answer.

                    ERICA

          I'm sorry. It's just...I'm sorry.




                                                        65.











                    HARRY

          You're like a thoroughbred in a world of
          mutts. No, you know what you are, you're
          like a great portrait over a fireplace.
          Words have been invented to describe
          women like you.

                    ERICA

              ( fearful)
          Such as?

                     HARRY

          Flinty   and...Impervious.

                    ERICA

          So you think I'm inhuman.

                    HARRY

          No. I think you're formidable.

                    ERICA

          But cold and distant. Like I'm
          frozen in some painting...

                    HARRY

          Not at all. I think you're strength
          defines you.
              (sees how sensitive she
               is)
          But it's thrilling when your defenses are
          down arid you're not isolated. That, I
          believe, is your winning combo. A killer
          combo actually.

                    ERICA

          ... So I can't decide if you hate me or if
          maybe you're the only person who ever got
          me.

                    HARRY

          I don't hate you.
The moment is broken when they HEAR the FRONT DOOR OPEN and

HIGH HEELS APPROACHING.


                    ERICA

          Hello?
Marin ARRIVES IN THE DOORWAY in a knockout of a dress holding
a bag from Zabars. She looks fresh, vibrant, sexy.

                    MARIN

          Room service!

                    ERICA

          What are you doing here at this hour?




                                                        66.










Erica and Harry have the air of kids caught making out by one
of their parents. Harry straightens out his pajamas, smooths
down his hair. Erica catches all this.

                    MARIN

              (enters, kisses Erica)

          I

            had this big photography auction
          tonight, then I went out with a
          bunch of people, I checked my
          messages and got this so sad
          message from Harry so bored out
          here. I thought I should come out
          and at least see how he was doing.
              (kisses Harry on the
               cheek)
          Thank you for the gorgeous flowers
          by the way. They were so huge...
Erica nods to herself. Oh, God, he sends them all flowers.
Harry notes Erica's reaction.

                    MARIN

          So how are you guys?
              (sets down the Zabar's
               bag)
          Oh, this is too sweet. You're making
          pancakes? Awwww. And you're both in your
          pj's. Now I feel I'm interrupting.

                    ERICA

          Don't be silly. You know I never
          sleep and this one doesn't sleep
          either. It's... .What's in the
          bag?

                    MARIN

              (reaches into the bag)
          A quart of matzoh ball soup for
          Harry. I know it's not the remedy
          for heart problems but it is low
          cholesterol.

                    ERICA

              (hating to correct her)
          But high sodium.

                    MARIN

          Oh, sorry. Stupid. For Mom, your
          favorite raisin-bread. And for
          me...
              (reaches into the bag)
          My favorite Vodka.
Marin's cell phone RINGS.




                                                          67.











                    MARIN

              (into phone)
          Hello? No I'm here, babe. Made record
          time. Everyone's still there?
Erica feeling suddenly frumpy, fixes her hair. Harry watches
her. She catches him and shrugs. Marin flips her phone shut
and tosses it in her purse.

                    ERICA

          So, Mar, now that you're here, why
          don't you finish the pancakes and
          I'll get back to work...

                    MARIN

          Mom! I just got here, hold on.
She pours a healthy Vodka into a glass, grabs some ice.

                    MARIN

          So your ex-husband stood me up
          today. We were supposed to have
          lunch at Barneys . He never showed
          up. Was he always like this?

                    ERICA

          Honey, I don't know...

                    MARIN

          This is what happens after a couple
          gets divorced, the kid inherits all
          the problems. Not that I'm a kid.
              (then to Harry, the flirt
               in her coming back)
          So how are you, how do you feel?
          When can you go home?
Just as harry is about to answer, Marin's cell RINGS. She
picks it up, looks at her caller ID, throws it back in her
bag.

                     ERICA

          I really am gonna do a little work.
          . . you two catch up. . . and just
          flip these Hin like two seconds.

                     ARRY

          You don't want pancakes anymore?

                    ERICA

          I, uh, I don't think I...I...
              (looks at Marin so)
          gorgeous, next to him
          No. I don't.




                                                        68.










Marin watches her mother EXIT then looks to Harry, his eyes
following her Mom out the door. She's sees a look on Harry's
face she never remotely saw when he looked at her. At first
she's shocked. He likes my mother??? Then a flash of
jealousy. He likes my mother!?! Then pure joy - realizing how
perfect it is.







INT. BRIDGEHAMPTON GENERAL STORE - DAY

Erica, back in a turtleneck, picks peaches out of a basket.
Marin ENTERS HER FRAME, baseball cap, sunglasses, picking
cherries.

                    MARIN

          I'm breaking up with Harry.

                    ERICA

          Why? What do you mean?

                    MARIN

          'Cause I met someone else.

                    ERICA

          In the two days you've been gone?

                    MARIN

          You know me, my life's crazy. I meet a
          thousand people everyday. Also, let's
          face it, the guy's insanely old for me.
          I'd be nuts to keep this going.

                    ERICA

          True, but you know he is....

                    MARIN

          -- I know. He's soulful when you
          don't expect it, right?

                    ERICA

          It's unnerving.

                    MARIN

          Now, Mom, if you could handle this,
          I was thinking... you and Harry...

                     ERICA

          I can't handle it. Wouldn't want to
          handle it.

                    MARIN

          But you're only saying that 'cause
          you think he and I have had sex.

                    ERICA

          Yes. Lower your voice. Haven't you?




                                                        69.











                    MARIN

              (whispering)
          Never even got close. Swear to God.
              (Erica digests this)
          Just puttin' that out there...'cause for
          two people who are convinced they got
          life beat, there's was somethin' cooking
          in the kitchen last night other than
          pancakes.







INT. ERICA'S KITCHEN

Erica looks out her KITCHEN WINDOW and SEES Marin and Harry
TALKING ON THE BEACH. She leans so far to see them, she's
about to lose her balance. The Phone RINGS, she reaches for
it and slips right Out Of Frame.

                    ERICA (O.S.)

              (into phone)
          Hello.







INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

Julian, in his scrubs, walks quickly down a hallway of the

                     J

ER, on his CELL PHONE.

                     ULIAN

          I've waited a reasonable amount of hours
          before calling you, even though you've
          been on my mind since I woke up at 5:15.
          I'm wondering when we could have dinner
          again? I have to work the next few nights
          and if we wait 'til next week, I know
          you'll chicken out so how's Friday? I
          know it's like a date night but I think
          that's good.

                    ERICA

          Who is this?
Julian stops short.

                    ERICA

          I'm kidding!

                    JULIAN

          Can you meet me at The Grill at
          eight?

                    ERICA

          Okay. Yes. That's seems fine.




I














                                                          70.











                    JULIAN

          I look forward to, seeing you too.
Erica smiles to herself.







ON JULIAN - AS HE LEANS AGAINST A WALL

turning off the phone and grabbing his heart

 NT. ERICA'S KITCHEN

Marin ENTERS through the kitchen door, looking almost a
little dazed.

                    MARIN

          Okay, he's all yours.

                    ERICA

          Stop that. How'd he take it?

                    MARIN

          He just took care of it for me; He
          was an ace. Elegant. Said our fate
          was to be friends. ...Oh my God.
              (realizes something)
          He was breaking up with me. He's a
          genius.

                    ERICA

          That's impossible, he wouldn't...

                    MARIN

          It doesn't matter, we're done and
          we both feel good about it.
              (hugs her)
          I gotta get back.
              (as she exits)
          Now Erica, try to think of this as
          the smartest thing you've ever done
          for yourself.
Marin EXITS and the PHONE RINGS.

                    ERICA

              (into the phone)
          Hello.

                    HARRY

          (from the beach)
          Thought you'd like to know your
          daughter broke up with me.
Harry and Erica talk while looking at each other through the
Kitchen Window.




                                                        71.











                     ERICA

          I heard.

                    HARRY

          Made up a story about meeting another
          guy. Guess I wasn't so cute with an IV in
          my arm.

                    ERICA

          No, I think she really did meet
          someone else.

                    HARRY

          Hey, it's alright. Her mother
          didn't like me anyway.

                    ERICA

              (smiles)
          How 'bout I bring you out some
          lunch and a couple of blood

                    H

          pressure pills?

                     ARRY

          You're a great woman, Erica.
              (Erica relaxes)
          Is this why my doctor is falling in
          love with you?

THE BEACH - MUSIC OVER

Erica and Harry sit on a blanket on a cloudy day having a
picnic lunch. Harry is telling Erica a story and she screams
with laughter.

BROWN STONES IN THE SAND - MUSIC CONTINUES

Erica picks them up as.she walks with Harry by the water's
edge. They talk non-stop.

A LITTLE LATER - LIGHTNING STREAKS THE SKY

Out of nowhere, a downpour. Erica and Harry gather their
picnic things. The blanket starts to fly and Harry grabs it
as Erica runs after a plate spinning away in the wind.

INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Erica and Harry, wet from the rain, quickly shut all the
doors and windows. Lightning crackles across the sky and THE

LIGHTS IN THE HOUSE GO OUT.


A MATCH IS STRUCK

and a CANDLE is lit. Then ANOTHER ONE, and ANOTHER ONE. Erica
turns and finds Harry just looking at her. Before either of
them has time to think, they kiss.




                                                        72.











                       ERICA

          I'm sorry.

                    HARRY

              (truly confused)
          For what?

                    ERICA

          I just kissed you.

                    HARRY

          No, honey, I kissed you.
Relieyed, Erica kisses him.

                    ERICA

          I know that one was me.

                    HARRY

          Try not to keep score.
He kisses her again and again.

                    HARRY

          Soft lips...

                    ERICA

          I'm so glad they still work.
I haven't used them for kissing in so long. They've been more
like for wearing lipstick and whistling and...
He kisses her quiet. Relieved, she finally fully kisses him
back. A big gorgeo~s kiss.

                    HARRY

          Well, well, now look who's got
something that works...
They both look down at Harry. Hello, Mr. Midnight.

                    ERICA

          And you didn't even take Via-

                     HARRY

              (puts his finger on her
               lips)
          Kiss me before you make it go away.

S

 he kisses him long and sweet.

ERICA'S BED

They're kissing on it. The rain pelts against the windows as
the sun goes down.




                                                        73.











                    HARRY

          This could be world class
          interesting.
              (Erica nods)
          Having any doubts?

                       ERICA

                 (as they kiss)
          Yes.

                       HARRY

          Me too.

                    ERICA

          But so far the kissing is
          spectacular.
              (He looks at her)
          I'm not grading you, just
          mentioning it. Brilliant.
He tries to kiss her neck but the turtleneck is in the way.
He pulls it down, but it's tight and it's, difficult to get
to her.

                    HARRY

          Can't get past your damn
          turtleneck. . .
He tries lifting the shirt from the bottom, it's awkward, he
doesn't want to be down there yet. He comes back up when
Erica reaches to her night table, slides opens the drawer,
takes out a SCISSORS and hands it to him.

                    ERICA

              (breathless)
          Cut it off... Please.
What a brilliant invitation. He takes the scissors and starts
cutting from the bottom, right past her belly, up her torso,
between her breasts. The turtleneck falls open from the
center. When he reaches her neck, he gently tears at it and
it easily rips apart and there she is. He takes her in.

                    HARRY

          You're beautiful.
She shakes her head, 'no' ...shuts her eyes.

                    HARRY

          Open your eyes so I know you can hear me.
              (she opens her eyes)
          Beautiful...
They kiss and she reaches down for his pants.




                                                        74.











                    HARRY

          What about birth control?

                       ERICA

          Menopause.

                    HARRY

              (thrilled)
          Who's the lucky boy...
He kisses between her breasts, her stomach, heads down and
OUT OF FRAME. Erica can't quite believe life held this twist
for her. Then:,

                    ERICA

          I think we should take your blood
          pressure.
His head POPS BACK INTO FRAME. What?????

                    ERICA

          It's irresponsible not to.

H


 ARRY -' A MINUTE LATER

sprawled out on the bed. Erica straddles him and whips the
blood pressure cuff on his arm and pumps it hard. Like a warm
Jewish Mother of a Dominatrix. He looks up at her, shaking
his head...

                    HARRY

          Nobody but you would. . .

                    ERICA

          Yeah...so you're lucky.
Erica grabs Harry's glasses, reads the results.

                    ERICA

              (ecstatic)
          One twenty over eighty!!! Baby!







THE BLOOD PRESSURE CUFF - IN SLOW MOTION

hurdles recklessly into the air.

EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER

The rain is coming down in torrents.

INSIDE

We are CLOSE ON ERICA'S FACE - UPSIDE DOWN, hanging off the
side of the bed. She's sweaty, flushed, overwhelmed...




                                                           75.














                    ERICA

          Oh my God, I do like sex.
CAMERA TWIRLS AROUND and we FIND HARRY, sprawled nearby,
catching his breath, satisfied, stunned, scared.

                    HARRY

          You certainly do.
Erica arrives next to him, also out of breath.

                    ERICA

          Wow. So this is what you're supposed to
          do on a rainy afternoon...
Harry smiles. He's trying to be his debonair self but
something's off. He's very aware of himself. They lie there
quietly for a second when Erica begins to tear up. Harry
slowly, nervously turns to her.

                    ERICA

          I really thought I was sorta closed for
          business. Just never expected this.

                     HARRY

              (nods)
          Nothin's ever surprised me more...
Flattered, Erica snuggles up close. Harry puts his arm around
her. Then, with no warning, his eyes fill with tears.

                    HARRY

          This is crazy. I can't remember the last
          time I cried. I think I'm overwhelmed.

                    ERICA

              (crying with him)
          Me too. That's the perfect word.

                    HARRY

          Baby, I had sex three days after a heart
          attack and I didn't die!
Erica pauses. Oh. That kind of overwhelmed.

                    HARRY

          That's gotta be some kind of record.
Good sport Erica gives him a double thumbs up.

                    ERICA

              (wiping her tears)
          Let's not brag about this to our
          doctor, okay?




                                                           76.











                    HARRY

          Honey I may not be many things but one -
          thing I am is a gentleman.
Harry holds her close.

                    HARRY

          Erica, Erica, Erica.
              (she turns to him)
          You know I'm not good at being
          monogamous, right?

                    ERICA

          Monogamous? Please, I hardly know
          you.
He looks at her wondering if she's for real. She smiles as
she wipes a small tear from the corner of her eye. Then he
kisses her.

LATER - THEY'RE HUDDLED UNDER THE COVERS


C

 ozy. Candles light the room. It's still raining.

                    HARRY

          -- So there I was at nineteen, in New
          York, by myself, and I'd never seen snow
          before and I didn't have enough money for
          the bus, so I had to walk. Had no idea
          how far it was and I'm talking blizzard
          and I'm in sneakers.

                    ERICA

          Awwwww,. . .

LATER - THEY'RE LYING ON A CHAISE

in Erica's room, making out. A Cell Phone RINGS. They both
look around for it. Erica reaches for it on her desk.

                    ERICA

              (disoriented)
          Hello? I mean...Hello.
              (turns phone upside down)
          Hello.







INTERCUT WITH MARIN IN A TAXI IN THE CITY - IT'S POURING


                    MARIN

          Mom, you guys okay out there?

                    ERICA

          We're fine. Why? What's going on?




                                                        77.











                    MARIN

          What do you mean, it's like a
          hurricane. The news said the winds
          are like a zillion miles an hour.

                    ERICA

          Oh, that. Oh, no, we're fine...




                    MARIN

          Are you having sex? Tell the truth.
          You are, aren't you.

                    ERICA

          Absolutely not. No. That is not
          going on now.

                    MARIN

          Oh my God, you already did it. Was
          it amazing?

                    ERICA

          I have to go.

                    MARIN

          Just tell me, was it amazing?

                    ERICA

          Yes and thank you for the wonderful
          opportunity.
Marin SCREAMMMMMMMMMMMS. Erica flips the phone shut, looks to
Harry, embarassed.

                    ERICA

              (to Harry)
          Am I interested in buying aluminum
          siding. . .

                    HARRY

          Really? Marin's selling aluminum siding?
Erica buries her face in his chest.

LATER

Harry and Erica SIT ON STOOLS AT THE KITCHEN ISLAND, drinking
wine and eating scrambled eggs right out of the pan. Candles
light the room.

                    HARRY

          --But why Paris?

                    ERICA

          I just always wanted to write a play that
          ended there.




                                                        78.











                    ERICA (CONT'D)

          People need romance like that. And if
          someone like me doesn't write it, where
          they gonna get it? Real life?

                    HARRY

              (slightly insulted)
          Excuse me. What do you call this? Eating
          eggs by candlelight in our robes after...
She kisses him, starts to say, "I'm sorry" when he pulls her
back, kisses her again, then looks at her hard, perplexed.

CLIMBING BACK UNDER THE COVERS


                    HARRY

          So where do you like to eat in
          Paris?    E

                     RICA

          Oh, I love this place called Le Balzar,
          it's just a little bistro on the Left
          Bank, best roast chicken in the universe.

                    HARRY

          You'd be fun to go to Paris with.

                     ERICA

          It's a great city to stay up all
          night in.
              (then)
          When's your birthday?

                      HARRY

          February.

                    ERICA

          Mine's in January. So, how 'bout if we
          still know each other by then we go to
          Paris for our birthdays.

                     HARRY

              (a beat, then)
          Maybe. . .

                    ERICA

          Oh. Sorry. You just...
              (sees the look on his
              face) .
          I have no idea how to do this...be
          intimate but not...The color is draining
          from your face. Okay, look, I'm gonna
          pee,take one of your blood pressure pills
          then when I get back, let's not talk
          anymore.




                                                          79.










She gets out of bed.

                    HARRY

          You're the funniest girl I ever had
          sex with.
She has no idea how to take that. Decides to accept it.

                    ERICA

          That's somethin'...

                       HARRY

          Honey... ?
She turns, sees he's getting out of bed, approaching her.

                    HARRY

          I think I'm gonna go back to my
          room...let you sleep.

                     ERICA

          Let me sleep? Oh, right...you usually
          send the girls home. . .but I am home...
          so...okay.

                    HARRY

          I'm an old dog, you' know.

                    ERICA

          Hey, it's perfectly. .. whatever.
          Good night. This was..This was a
          great night. For me...

                    HARRY

          Me too. At one point I even thought
          soul mates, you know...
Erica nods. She knows.

HARRY FLOPS ONTO HIS BED

stares straight up at the ceiling.

INT. ERICA'S ROOM - SAME TIME

Erica gets back in her bed. She lies there for a
second,securing her armor back in place. She routinely moves
to the middle of the bed,neatens out the covers and shuts her
eyes. Then a small KNOCK on her open door. She sees Harry in
the doorway.

                    HARRY

          I'd like to try sleeping with you.




I














                                                          80.










Erica hesitates, then moves to one side of the bed and as
Harry climbs in next to her we:

                                          FADE THRU TO:


EXT. HOUSE - THE FOLLOWING MORNING

The place is a mess, the aftermath of the storm.

HNT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - THE SAME TIME

 arry spoons with Erica on her side of 'the bed, his arms
snuggly around her. The ELECTRICITY POPS BAGK ON and the room
is suddenly lit up and one of Erica's French CDs comes on
full blast.
Harry opens his eyes. He's surprised to see he has his arm
around her. Erica awakens just as surprised. In the light of
day, a definite hint of embarrassment ...

                    HARRY

              (grabs his watch, blinks)
          Can you see this?

                    ERICA

          Not really but it looks like it
          says eleven.

                    HARRY

              (slips on his glasses)
          It is eleven...

                    ERICA

          It can't be, that would mean we
          slept eight hours.

                    HARRY

          Impossible.
They turn and finally look at each other. Both look wrinkled,
messy haired, a little wiped.

                    HARRY

          How ya doin' Ace?
              (she ,elts as he lies
               right back down)
          Whoa Nelly...little dizzy.

                    ERICA

          Okay, just stay still, here's the
          clicker. You know you have a
          doctor's appointmQnt in an hour.
              (getting out of bed)

              (MORE )





                                                        81.














                    ERICA (CONT'D)

          I'll make us some coffee, get you your
          pills, whip us up some french toast, I
          have ,the best maple syrup ever. '

                    HARRY

          Erica...
              (she turns)
          You are a woman to love.
Erica smiles, then walks away with the achey walk of a woman
who hasn't had sex in many a year but has more than made up
for it in the last 12 hours. She holds onto the wall as she
exits the room, a little bow-legged, like she's just gotten
off a horse. Alone in the hallway, she stops.

                    ERICA

          You are woman to love. What the
          hell does that mean?

AN EKG MACHINE

Spits out a long tape. TILT UP to Julian at the end of the
tape. Harry sits on an examining table in JULIAN'S OFFICE,
buttoning up his shirt.

                    JULIAN

          Okay, buddy, I'm sending you home. These
          past few days have done wonders for you.

                    HARRY

          Yeah, I've been working on that stair
          thing. I can do it by the way.

                    J


                     ULIAN

          Do what?

                    HARRY

              (quickly)
          Climb a flight of stairs. Several times
          actually.
Harry stands, tucks in his shirt, smiling proudly to himself.

                    JULIAN

          Way to go. How's Erica?

                    HARRY

              (caught)
          Erica?

                    JULIAN

          I know you must know her name by
          now.




                                                        82.














                    HARRY

          Yes, I do. Erica, as it turns out
          is an amazing woman. Does whatever
          she can to make me happy. Really.
          Turns out she's very giving.
Julian, suddenly riveted to these words.

                    HARRY

          Very giving.

                    JULIAN

              (looking away)
          Yeah, well that's wonderful. I
          think she's wonderful.
A real moment between them. Julian decides to take the high
road.

                    HARRY

          I think she's wonderful too.

                    JULIAN

              (gathering his things)
          Give her my best...

                    HARRY

          Julian. Thanks for everything.
Julian shakes Harry's hand. Harry's eyes TEAR UP.

                    JULIAN

          You're gonna be okay.

                    HARRY

              (touching his tears)
          What the...? This is the second
          time I've done this now. I get
          overcome or something. . .

                    JULIAN

          It's very common to become emotional
          after having an episode like you've had.
          Everything takes on a new meaning.

                    HARRY

              (wiping his tears)
          So it's not crazy for a man to do
          something entirely out of character
          after having a heart attack?

                    JULIAN

              (handing him Kleenex)
          Like crying?




                                                        83.











                    HARRY

          Yeah and totally changing their
          tastes. Like suddenly really liking
          something they never thought they
          could like...ever...and I'm talking
          really liking it. It's...unnerving.

                    JULIAN

          I think you can expect just about
          anything right now. People have done some
          wild things after having a heart
          attack...selling businesses, getting
          divorced, moving... Some people say it
          saved their lives.

                    HARRY

          But most people go back to being
          themselves, right? I'll go back to
          being me, won't I?

                    J


                        ULIAN

          We'll see.







ERICA - TYPING - HER PHONE RINGS

She wears a blouse with more buttons unbuttoned than ever in
her life. She picks up the phone.

HARRY DRIVES ERICA'S CAR, TOP DOWN.


                       HARRY

                 (on his cell)
          Hi.

                      ERICA

          Hey.    What'd he say?

                    HARRY

          He said you're wonderful.

                    ERICA

          No, really, what'd he say...How are you?

                    HARRY

          He said I'm good..that I can go.

                     . ERICA

              (obviously conflicted)
          Oh. So... Congratulations. That's really.
          . . great.

                    HARRY

          Yeah, he said... by tomorrow for absolute
          sure. You think you can deal with me for
          one more night?




                                                        84.














A CROWDED CLUB - SOUTHAMPTON - THAT NIGHT

Packed with Young People. In the middle of this twentysomething
sun burnt beach crowd, we find, Erica and Harry, the two coolest
people in the room, dancing with each other.

A LITTLE 'LATER - THE KARAOKE ROOM

Harry leads Erica through a crowd listening to a Girl singing
Britney Spears' Oops, I Did It Again. When she finishes the
crowd enthusiastically applauds.

                    HARRY

              (big breath)
          Okay, here goes...

                    ERICA

          Here goes what?

                    HARRY

          Here goes me singing to you...
              (pulling a DISC out of his
               pocket)
          Bought my own music.

                    ERICA

          You knew they had karaoke?

                    HARRY

          Baby, it's why we're here. .
Harry makes his way TO THE STAGE, hands them his disc. He's
handed a microphone. He looks right at Erica.

                    HARRY

          This is for you, Ace...
              (then, under his breath)
          wish me luck.
The Music begins and it is an instrumental version of one of
Erica's French Songs, "I Wish You Love".

                    HARRY

              (sings)
          I wish you bluebirds in the spring... To
          Give your heart a song to sing... And
          then a kiss, but more than this... I wish
H         you love...
 arry takes out a sheet of paper and his glasses.

                    HARRY

          Don't want to blow this part...
Now Harry sings the rest of the song IN FRENCH. . .




                                                           85.

                    HARRY

              (sings)
          Et en juillet une limonade...Pour
          vous refroidir dans quelque lefy
          glade...
And so on... Erica watches knowing something in her life has
just that second, forever changed. And as Harry continues
singing, we:

                                         CUT TO:


LOWELL - THE NEXT DAY

Packing the Trunk of the Town Car in front of Erica's house.

INT. HARRY'S ROOM - SAME TIME

Harry tosses his pills in a leather bag. .. Erica enters
doing the worst job she's ever done of being strong.

                    ERICA

              (holding some cigars)
          Here you go, you can have these back now.
              (Harry looks confused)
          I confiscated them your first night
          here...

                    HARRY

              (smells them)
          Thank you darlin' ...

                    ERICA

          Try not to smoke them...
              (hands him a small bag)
          And I packed you a sandwich, just
          in case your blood sugar got low.
          And some of that iced-tea you like,
          and a nonfat, low cholesterol
          cookie. And a peach.

                    HARRY

          what a doll...
              (notices)
          Got something else?
From behind her back Erica pulls out a Mason Jar filled with
all dark beach stones with ONE WHITE STONE in the center.

                    ERICA

          Something to remember me by.
Harry hugs her. Erica awkwardly throws her arms around him
and kisses him, then kisses him better. He's moved by her.




                                                          86.











                    HARRY

          There is that...

                    ERICA

          And hey, we'll always have Paris.

                    HARRY

          Honey, no words can ever express my
          gratitude for taking me in and taking care
          of me and...

                    ERICA

          Hey, your heart attack could be the best
          thing that ever happened to me.

                     HARRY

              (kisses her quickly, even
               faster throws out)
          I love ya.

                    ERICA

          I love you too...if that's what you said. I
          don't know if it ends in 'ya' if it's an
          official I love you but...
Harry expression looks something like he's in pain. Then. . .

                    HARRY

          You're not like anybody.

                    ERICA

          Neither are you.







INT. CAR - MOVING AWAY FROM THE HOUSE - DAY

Lowell drives, rattling on about all the people who have been
calling about him. Harry, in the backseat, looks back at the
house, until it is finally out of view.
Harry then looks inside the bag with the sandwich and finds an
Envelope from Erica, pulls it out, doesn't open it, places it back
in the bag then takes out his cell phone and dials.

INT. ERICA'S LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME - OVER, THE PHONE RINGS

The room is empty. Erica rushes in, picks up the phone.

                     E


                     RICA

          I knew you'd call.

MARIN - WALKING IN SOHO

on her cell phone, CRYING.




                                                          87.











                     MARIN

           Who? It's me.

INTERCUT


                     ERICA

           What's wrong?

                     MARIN

           I had breakfast with Dad this morning and
           we're talking and he starts looking all
           weir~ and then he tells me he met someone
           three weeks ago and it's "really
           something and then he
               (sobbing now)
           He tells me he's getting married. Why am
           I reacting this way? I'm almost thirty
           years old...
               (people stare at her)
           Yes, I'm crying, leave me alone.

                     ERICA

           Who's he marrying?

                     MARIN

           I don't know. Some chick he met three
           weeks ago. She's four years older than me
           and she's an Ear, Nose and Throat Doctor.
           Has he lost his mind? I have a huge
           auction tonight... Why do I have to be
           the one to deal with this? Can you please
           come in? I'm rea:~y upset, my shrink'~
           away for two weeks...I know you're
           working but. . .please. . ?

AN UPPER EAST SIDE STREET - A LITTLE LATER

One of those gorgeous tree lined streets from a Woody Allen
movie that makes New York seem quaint. Harry's Town Car
pulls up in front of a GORGEOUS   PRISTINE TOWNHOUSE. Harry
steps out in shades, holding an   unlit cigar. Lowell joins him
as the Front Door opens and out   pours his Two Leggy
Assistants and thumping Hip Hop   Music.
LOWELL Good to be back?
HARRY Let's find out.

EXT. ERICA'S HOUSE - LATER

Camera quickly TRACKS Erica down the front path and to her
car. She's on her cell.




                                                        88.











                    ERICA

          Hold on, I'm losing you. Okay,    so you'll
          let Harry know I'll be. in the    city
          tonight and he can reach me on    my
          cell...if he wants... Okay? Aw    shit.
          Hello?

EXT. SOTHEBY'S AUCTION HOUSE - THAT NIGHT

A Crowd files in for tonight's auction.

INT. BACKSTAGE DRESSING ROOM - SAME TIME

A tearful Marin is changing from jeans and a T-shirt to a
proper dress and heels. Erica leans on a table, listening.

                     MARIN

          -- Look, I get that he has a right to get
          remarried, but he doesn't even know her
          and she's like my age. You know what
          that's like? It's like beyond creepy. And
          I know he's not replacing me so why does
          it feel like he is? This is crazy, right?
          Crying like this...

              (

                lights a cigarette)

                    ERICA

          Honey, if he's replacing anyone, it's me.
          And all the statistics say divorced men
          almost always remarry. That's just the
          way they're built.

                    MARIN

              (slipping on her dress)
          Mom, you want to know the answer to
          the big mystery of my life? Why I'm
          always with the wrong guy? This is
          why. Because the wrong guy can't do
          this to you. You have some control
          with the wrong guy. This thing I'm
          feeling right now. This is my big
          fear...that some guy could get me
          unglued like this, like nothing's
          connected. And this is just my
          father! I'm just not strong enough
          to handle this kind of drama.

                    ERICA

          The drama in life is what makes you
          strong.

                    MARIN

          No, it's what makes you strong.
          You've never really understood
          this,but we're not all like you.




                                                      89.











                    MARIN (CONT'D)

          I'm sorry, if I were you and my ex
          husband, the man who I still allow to
          direct my plays.! was getting married to
          some 33 year old Ear, Nose and Throat
          Babe, I'd be bonkers. And look at you.
              (realizes)
          You've never looked better, by the way.
              (sinks)
          My anti-depressant is obviously not
          working. It should cover events like this
          shouldn't it?

                    ERICA

          Since when do you take an antidepressant?

                    MARIN

          Ugggh, mother, do you know anyone who
          doesn't?

                       ERICA

          Yes. Me.

                    MARIN

          I rest my case.
A KNOCK on the door.

                    VOICE FROM OUTSIDE

          Marin, we're all set.

                    MARIN

          Mom, can you do one other really
          big thing for me? Just say yes.

                    ERICA

              (taking two Turns)
          Anything bubee.

                    MARIN

          Will you come out to dinner tonight
          with me and Dad and the fiance?

                    ERICA

          Absolutely not. No.

                    MARIN

          Please. He wants me to meet her and I can
          not go alone. I already asked him if you
          could come and he said it was fine and
          she said it was fine. Look, you're gonna
          have to meet her too, so, we might as
          well meet her together. Come on, you know
          you can handle it.




                                                        90.










Erica pauses, thinks M
                     about it. She knows she can too.

                      ARIN

           Okay. That's it. See that look on
           your face. That's the gene I didn't
           get.

INT. SOTHEBY' S - MOMENTS LATER

Marin, now all pulled together, stands at the podium in front
of a packed house. If' you didn't know, you'd never guess.

                     MARIN

           Good evening and welcome to Sotheby's and
           this evening's sale of Impressionistic

ON ERICA

in the back of the room, watching with pride and worry. She
slips out her cell, checks her messages. Her phone lights up
and tells her she has "0" Voice Mail.

A CLOCK ON THE WALL - IT'S 8:30

We are in ERICA'S EMPTY KITCHEN in The Hamptons and her phone
is RINGING.

ANGLE - A CELL PHONE

as A Man's HAND turns it off. We are:

INT. HAMPTON'S RESTAURANT

Julian sits at a table, by himself, in a coat and tie,
tucking away his phone. The Waiter sympathetically approaches
the table.

                     JULIAN

           Guess I got stood up.

                     WAITER

           Would you like to order or...?




                                                        91.











                    JULIAN

          Why not, I put. on the tie and
          everything. And can you bring me
          another. . .
              (indicating his drink)
Julian takes a look at the menu, then looks away.

TWO DINNER PLATES ARE CARRIED THROUGH THE RESTAURANT

and as the CAMERA WIDENS we realize we are:

IN A CHIC CAFE IN MANHATTAN - LATER THAT NIGHT

Camera takes us to Erica, Marin, Dave and DAVE'S FIANCE, KRISTEN,
a combo of a hot tie and a young professional. Everyone has menus
and drinks. A Waiter delivers two new Martinis for Marin and
Erica. They both go right for them. Erica drinks too much too
fast.                D

                     AVE

              (to Erica)
          Thirsty?

                    ERICA

          I've had a big week Dave, forgot how
          these slip right down. I'm fine. So,
          Kristen, where'd you go to...
              (burps)
          --medical school? Excuse me.

                    KRISTEN

          University of Pennsylvania.

                    ERICA

          I went to school in Philadelphia
          too.

                    DAVE

          Bryn Mawr girl.

                     KRISTEN

          That's amazing. My Mom went to Bryn
          Mawr . . .

                    MARIN

          Wow. So not only are you marrying my father
          but our mothers went to the same college.
Marin takes out a pack of cigarettes.

                    MARIN

          Anyone mind?

                    KRISTEN

          Actually I do.




                                      92.











          MARIN

Okay, I'll just..have one.
    (lights up)
So, this isn't going badly so far
is it? I mean for a totally surreal
situation like this.

          DAVE

Shall we order?

          KRISTEN

Absolutely.

          DAVE

    (peruses menu)
Erica, do I like duck?

          ERICA

Yes. It's rabbit you hate.
    (to Kristen)
I'll give you a list of everything
he likes and dislikes.

          DAVE

Let's let her figure some things
out on her own.

          ERICA

I didn't mean those things, Dave.
She did go to medical school.

          MARIN

    (pointing to herself and
    Kristen)
Hey, not in front of the kids.

          ERICA

    (polishing off her
     Martini)
I will tell you this...Dave has one
truly great love in his life.

          KRISTEN

Really? What's that?

             ERICA

His balls.

          DAVE

Okay, I forgot to mention she can't
drink hard liquor.
    (to Marin)
Why did you order her a Martini?




                     E














                                                        93.











                    ERICA

          What? It's not true? The man can not
          watch TV or read without the hand down
          the pants-- Here's my advice after 21
          years I say who cares, they're his
          balls,let him enjoy 'em.

                    MARIN

              (chokes)
          I think I swallowed my olive, whole.
Erica looks up and sees something that takes her breath away.

A COUPLE ZIGZAGGING AROUND TABLES

and headed in her direction. A sexy Young Thing followed by
her date -- no other than Harry. Harry stops to shake
someone's hand, holds his date around the waist. Suddenly,
the SOUND DROPS OUT of the restaurant as Harry and his Date
walk right by Erica's table in SLOW MOTION, not noticing her.

M


 OVING IN ON ERICA

as the room comes alive again. Her eyes follow Harry as he is
seated only one table away, his back to Erica, his Date
facing her. Marin hasn't seen him. Erica tries her hardest to
act normal but apparently isn't.

                    MARIN

          Mom, you okay?

                    ERICA

          Yeah, fine.
Erica looks at her menu then her eyes go right back to Harry.
His Date is laughing at something Harry is saying. Harry
leans in to her, whispers something to her. She touches his
hand.

                     RICA

          You know what? Maybe I need a little
          air...
Erica rises; grabs her purse, almost bumps into a Waiter as
she passes Harry's table, knocks into someone's chair, a
glass breaks. Everyone turns to her, including Harry. She now
stands right at his table. He smiles up at her.

                     HARRY

          Hey.

                    ERICA

          Hello... Harry.
              (to his Date)
          Hello...




                                                          94.











EXT. RESTAURANT

Erica rushes out. She's a little high and her heart is
pounding. She heads down the street.

                    ERICA

          Oh, God, I'm so stupid...
She picks up her pace, starts running. Her cell phone RINGS.

                    ERICA

          Hello?
Intercut Harry and Erica on their cells, a block apart.

                    HARRY

              (walking quickly)
          Slow down. You want to kill me?
She considers it.

                    ERICA

          Harry, I gotta go...

                    HARRY

          Erica, she's just a friend.

                     ERICA

          Yeah, she looks like a buddy kind
          of a girl.
Erica reaches a corner, can't get across, turns the corner.
Harry ARRIVES NEXT TO HER.

                    HARRY

          Come on, it's just a dinner...

                    ERICA

          Look, Harry, here's the problem. I
          really like you.

                    HARRY

          I really like you.

                    ERICA

          Yeah, but I love you like you.
              (that stops him)
          I do. I love you.
Harry swoons and not in a good way.

                    HARRY

          I think maybe you should consider
          that you're in love with the idea
          of being in love.




                                             95.














          ERICA


D

 o you? Okay. Oh, God...
    (stomps her feet)
I'm like the dumb girl who doesn't get it.
    (tries not to cry in front
     of him)
I've never been the dumb girl
before. It ain't so great.

          HARRY

Let's just calm down. This was just
a a meal with a friend.

           ERICA

-- Did you know I called you seven
hours ago?

          HARRY

I was gonna call you. I've been jamming
all day, it's my first day back.

          ERICA

Uh-huh. . .

          HARRY

I had these plans before I met you. But I
do like seeing you. I do. I'm always
surprised by it.

          ERICA

What was I thinking?

          HARRY

Maybe you weren't thinking for once and
look what a good time we had. Let's not
ruin something great.

          ERICA

Harry, I won't be good at this.

           HARRY

At what?

          ERICA

Acting like I don't care.

          HARRY

I have never lied to you. I have always
told you some version of the truth.

          ERICA

    (freaking on that one)
The truth doesn't have versions.




                                            96.











          HARRY

Can you cut me a little slack? My
life's been turned upside down.

          ERICA

Yeah. Mine too.

          HARRY

Then let's each get our bearings.

          ERICA

I don't want my bearings. I've had my
bearings my whole fucking life. I felt
something with you that... Oh, you don't
want to-

          HARRY

Yes I do.
    (she won't open up)
Tell me.

          ERICA

I felt something with you, I didn't know
really existed. You know what that's like
after a twenty year marriage? To feel
something for another person that's so
off the charts, that -
    (Harry looks down)
Okay, not your problem. This is why
I'm not good in relationships. You
know writers are like teachers,
those who can - do, those who can't
- write romantic comedies where
THIS does not happen in the third
act...and it certainly does not
happen to a 55 year old woman. In
the play I'll be 36 so it won't be
as pathetic. I'm just too old to
feel crushed.I've written this
feeling but I never really got it.
    (realizes)
You know what this is?
    (pointing to herself)
This is heart broken. How's that
for impervious?

          HARRY

You're killin' me.

          ERICA

I just wish it had lasted more than a
week.

          HARRY

Me too.




                                                      97.











                    ERICA

          That's a horrible thing to say.
              (walks off, comes back)
          The life I had before I met you. I
          knew how to do that, could do that
          forever. Now look at me...what do I
          do with all this?

                    HARRY

          Can we talk tomorrow?

                    ERICA

          What for? I saw your friend you were
          having dinner with, if that's what you
          want, it's never going to work with me.
          Look at me. I'm a middle aged woman,
          don't let this brown hair fool you, I
          don't have a real brown hair on my head,
          I'm almost all grey...that would freak
          you out, wouldn't it? And I have. high
          cholesterol and my back hurts every
          morning and I'm post menopausal and I
          have osteoperosis and I'm sure arthritis
          is just around the corner and I know
          you've seen my vericose veins. Let's face
          it man, that's not quite the buzz you're
          lookin' for.
A TAXI pulls up.

                    ERICA

          And you know what? Everyday, I'm
          gettin' older. ..just like you.
Erica opens the back door of the Taxi.

                      HARRY

          Wait.
Erica turns.
This is his chance.

                    HARRY

          I just... the truth is... I don't
          know how to be a boyfriend.

                     ERICA

          That's what you have to say after all
          this? You don't know how to be a
          boyfriend.

                    HARRY

          That's not a small thing.
They're both out of words.




                                                           98.











                    ERICA

          Are we done?

                    HARRY

          I don't know.
She nods. He doesn't give. She ducks into the CAB and it
PULLS AWAY. Harry stands on the street, watching her go.

                    HARRY

              (winces)
          Ouch.
He grabs his heart.

                       HARRY

          Oh, God...







HARRY - ON A GURNEY

wheeled through the Emergency Room of Beth Israel Hospital.
This is not the Hamptons. This place is crawling with
patients. Harry's delivered to a Latina Doctor in her
thirties, DR. MARTINEZ. As he's taken off the gurney, he's
immediately hooked up to a heart monitor, given oxygen and an

IV.


                    NURSE

          Came in by cab, 15 minutes of chest
          pain, no nauseau, some shortness of
          breath, was hospitalized a week ago
          with a coronary thrombosis.

                    DR. MARTINEZ

          Hang a nitro drip.

                    HARRY

          You can't. I took Viagra.

                    DR. MARTIINEZ

          You have been through this before.
          Give him 5 mgs of Metoprolol. You
          h~ving chest pain right now?

                    H


                     ARRY

          No, and the pain I was having was
          sharp, not like before.

                    . DR. MARTINEZ

          That's good. Not like before is we
          like to hear.
              (reads EKG)
          Give him aspirin.




                                                        99.











                      DR. MARTINEZ (CONT'D)

          Based   on what I see so far, your
          heart   is not in distress but I'm
          gonna   do a rapid enzyme test to be
          sure.    What were you doing at the
          onset   of the pain?

                    HARRY

          Having a fight with someone. A woman. Can
          a woman give you chest pain?

                    DR. MARTINEZ

          Are you kidding? Love hurts, haven't you
          heard?

                    HARRY

          Yeah, but so far, I've only given pain, I
          never got any.

                    DR. MARTINEZ

              (confused at how literal
               he is)
          All right, well you're battin' a thousand
          here. Your enzymes look perfect, your
          EKG is normal and the pain doesn't sound
          like the kind of pain we worry about. I
          think what you experienced was normal
          chest pain associated with stress.

                      HARRY

          Stress?

                    DR. MARTINEZ

          And incase you haven't heard, that can
          give you a heart attack. Mr. Langer, I
          donlt know what you're up to gallivanting
          out and about at this hour, but if you
          were my Dad, I'd make sure you were home,
          in bed, recuperating.

INT. HARRY'S TOWNHOUSE - LATER

Harry slowly climbs up the gorgeous staircase of his
Townhouse. Exhausted, he stops half way up, sits on a step,
takes out his cell.

                    HARRY

          If you were my Dad...
He pulls his glasses out of his pocket, puts them on to dial.
Something feels odd, he takes off his glasses, looks at them,
they're not his -- they're Erica's. He puts them back on and
dials.




                                                         100.











                    ERICA'S VOICE

          Hi. It's Erica. I'm not here so
          leave a message.
He realizes he doesn't know what to say, hangs up, then looks
at her glasses.

                    HARRY

              (grabbing his chest)
          Ouch.

BLACK SCREEN




A LIGHT POPS ON and Erica ENTERS HER BEDROOM, crying. She
flops down on her bed, picks up her phone, grabs her glasses,
puts them on, doesn't realize they're Harry's. She dials.
Voice Mail tells her she has One Message. She sits up,
excited.             J

                     ULIAN'S VOICE

          Erica, Hi, it's Julian. It's about
          8:20, I'm in the restaurant...just
          Wondering if you're...
Erica hangs up, starts crying again. She takes off her
glasses to wipe her eyes when she realizes she's holding
Harry's glasses. Just the sight of them makes her burst into
tears, the kind of tears that have been thirty years in the
making.

ERICA'S COMPUTER KEYBOARD - NIGHT

A tear lands on it. Erica, back in a turtleneck and wearing
Harry's glasses, starts writing at a breakneck pace, all the
while, tears flood her eyes.

MORNING - WAVES BREAKING ON THE SHORE


ERICA

wakes up. As soon as her eyes open, she bursts into tears.
While in the SHOWER, the crying never stops. While she EATS
BREAKFAST, a downpour. Running ON THE BEACH, she's wailing.
Back at the "COMPUTER, she's sobbing as her hands fly over
the keys. An actual boo hoo can be heard.
At NIGHT, laptop in bed, Erica writes, eating a   bagel, wearing
Harry's glasses and a pair of wrinkled pajamas,   FRENCH MUSIC plays
in the BG. At this point, she doesn't eVen" pay   attention to her
tears, just wipes and types when out of nowhere   she receives an
INSTANT MESSAGE from HARRY.
He writes: Do I hear French Music?
Shocked, she sits up, tries to fix her hair.




H














                                                         101.











INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Harry sits up in bed, staring at his laptop, wearing Erica's
glasses, a pair of pajamas and a three day growth. A
thermometer is propped in his mouth.
He writes: R U there?
She answers: Yes. Hello.
He writes: How are ya?
She writes: Great... as, she wipes her tears on her sleeve.
 e writes:How's the writing going?
She answers: Pouring out of me now. Go figure.

E

He types: I miss y .. He stops, thinks before sending.
 rica waits on her side. Nothing, is coming over.
Then, on his side, he receives: Actually just running out.
Take care...
Harry deletes the I miss y... and instead writes: U 2.
Erica slides down in her bed, wiped.

INT. HARRY' S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Harry takes out his thermometer. Feels lost. Looks at the
clock. It's 10:00 p.m.

INT. LOWELL'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Lowell lies in bed in pj's, WATCHING TV, smoking. Harry
arrives at his doorway in his pajamas. Lowell puts out his
cigarette, fans the smoke.

                    HARRY

          Lowell, I'm goin' out.

                    LOWELL

              (confused)
          Okay. Don't forget to put some
          clothes on.

                    HARRY

          I mean, I should go out, shouldn't I?
          Since .when don't I go out? Just cause
          some Emergency Room Doctor tells me to
          stay in bed, doesn't mean I have to turn
          into a monk.




                                                       102.











                    LOWELL

          Is there something you'd like me to
          do for you, Mr. Langer?

                    HARRY

          Well, no, just...well, what are you
          doin'?

                    LOWELL

          Watching Lucy.

                    HARRY

          Would you hate making me something
          to eat?

CLOSE - LUCY AND ETHEL ON TV


REVERSE - HARRY AND LOWELL

lying on top of the covers in Lowell's room, both eating
bowls of pasta, watching TV.

                    HARRY

          Funny women are adorable, don't you
          think?

                    LOWELL

          I never really thought about it.

                    HARRY

          Neither had I, but think about it.
          Funny's a unique thing in a woman. It's
          fun to be around.

                    LOWELL

          There's some reason we've been
          watching these two for 5O years.

                    HARRY

          Exactly. It lasts. We're not
          sittin' here watchin' Mamie Van
          Doren reruns.

                    LOWELL

          No we're not. You feeling okay?

                    HARRY

          I don't think I've slept one night
          since I've been home. Every little
          ache and pain scares the shitout of
          me...can't get a handle on my
          emotional life, don't know what I
          want, don't know if what I felt was
          because I just had a heart attack
          or was real. Plus, I feel needy. I
          never used that word in my life.




                                                       103.











                    HARRY (CONT'D)

          Lowell, have you ever seen me like
          this? Be honest.

                    LOWELL

          Nothing even close.

                    HARRY

          That's right, buddy, I'm a mess.
          And I'm no good at it.
              (realizes something)
          Those are very nice pajamas, by the
          way. Did they used to be mine?

                    LOWELL

          Yes but you gave them to me, you
          said you never wore them.

                    HARRY

          I know. But why would I do that?
          They're so elegant. Nice piping...

                    LOWELL

          Mr. Langer, you're always giving
          away beautiful things.

                    HARRY

          Awwwww... How did I get like this?
              (eyes fluttering shut)
          I'm gonna shut my eyes for a few
          minutes. Keep Lucy on...
Harry nods off and Lowell TURNS OUT THE LIGHT.

EXT. BEACH - THE HAMPTONS - MORNING - MUSIC OVER

Erica and Zoe are taking a walk. Erica, still crying, picks
up a brown stone, explains its meaning to Zoe. Zoe holds the
stone, makes an `awwww' face.Erica nods, then Zoe tosses the
stone in the ocean, fed up with hearing about him already.
Then, Zoe stops Erica, points to something.

MARIN AND HER NEW BOYFRIEND

frolicking on the beach. He's a YOUNG HUNK in a tank top,
shorts, highlighted hair. Erica rolls her eyes.

EXT. BEACH STAIRS - DUSK

Marin rushes down the stairs. Erica sits near the bottom of
the stairs, watching the sunset.

                    MARIN

          Mom, we're going into town...
Erica turns, wiping tears.




                                      104.











          MARIN

Are you crying?
    (joining her)
I didn't know you did that.

          ERICA

Yeah, it's my new thing. I've
gotten abnormally great at it.

          MARIN

    (sitting on the step with
    her)
Is it Harry?

          ERICA

Seems I gotta learn how to do that
love 'em and leave 'em stuff.

          MARIN

Fucking men. You don't care when I
say fuck, do you?

          ERICA

Not really. Sometimes. Not right
now.

          MARIN

So now you get my theory about
love? You gotta self protect. It's
too dangerous.

          ERICA

Marin, that theory... how can I put
this so your feelings won't get
hurt. It's just so crazy, it makes
me want to SCREAMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!

          MARIN

And how would you put it if you
wanted to hurt my feelings?

          ERICA

Listen to me... you cannot hide
from love for the rest of your life
because maybe it won't work out and
maybe you'll become unglued. That's
not a way to live.

          MARIN

So you're telling me you're happy
right now? This is good what
happened to you?




                                                       105.











                    ERICA

          No. This was bad. But for the three days
          it was good, it was electrifying.
Marin's eyes fill up.

                    ERICA

          I think you must consider the possibility
          that we are more alike than you realize.
          I let someone in and I had the time of my
          life.

                    MARIN

              (tearful)
          I've never had the time of my life.

                    ERICA

          I know. And bubbee, I say this from
          the deepest part of my heart. . ...
          what the fuck are you waiting "for?

INT. HARRY'S HOUSE - NYC - NIGHT

A PARTY is in progress. It's loud. The place is crawling with
characters from the Hip Hop world. Harry winds his way down his
crowded STAIRCASE, Girls grabbing at him as he passes by. As hard
as he tries, he can't quite bring to life the guy he knew how to
be.

                    LOWELL

              (as Harry passes)

          H

           aving fun?

                       HARRY

          Not quite.
Harry makes his way down the stairs, through the crowded
entry and OUT THE FRONT DOOR. OUTSIDE, Harry steps into the
QUIET STREET, looks up at his house and the party inside.

EXT. ROADSIDE FARM STAND - EAST HAMPTON - DAY

Zoe is picking corn, when she notices Julian across the way.
He glances up, looks right past her, obviously doesn't
remember her, keeps on shopping. Zoe thinks for a see,
wondering how she can get his attention when he looks right
back at her, his face full of hope.

INT. ERICA'S DINING ROOM - LATER

Erica sets the table for two. Zoe pokes her head in the door.

                    ZOE

          I got you something great at the
          farm stand.




J














                                                       106.










Zoe fully opens the door revealing Julian holding a bouquet
of fresh cut flowers.

                    JULIAN

          These are for you to give me when
          you apologize.

INT. DINING ROOM - LATER - MUSIC OVER

Candlelit. Zoe, Erica and Julian share a bottle of wine and a
home cooked meal. The CAMERA does a 360 around the table,
their faces saying it all. The Women bask in Julian's warmth
as he entertains them with stories. Zoe looks from Julian to
Erica, relieved to see her sister smiling again.

INT. KITCHEN - LATER

Erica places coffee cups in the sink. Julian is next to her,
leaning against the counter, holding a glass of wine.

                    ERICA

          Julian, I hope you know I'm
          mortified by my behavior. I was
          going to get in touch with you,
          send you a note or something...

                    JULIAN

          A note? That's a little chilly.

                    ERICA

          I'm embarrassed. I just haven't
          been myself lately. What can I say?

                    JULIAN

          Just tell me you're sorry.

                    ERICA

          I am sorry.

                    JULIAN

          Then you could kiss me.

                       ERICA

          Kiss you?
 ulian nods.

                    ERICA

          You'll forgive me if I kiss' you?

                       JULIAN

          Think so.
Erica hesitates then gives him a peck of a kiss.




                                                         107.











                    JULIAN

          No one on earth would forgive you
          for that kiss
              (places his wine glass on
               the counter)
          May I?
Erica nods as Julian takes her in his arms and gives her a
kiss that doesn't quit.

                    JULIAN

              (still holding her,
              whispers)
          I forgive you.
Erica very distinctly begins to hear the BEATING of her own
heart.

                                          DISSOLVE TO:


ERICA'S COMPUTER SCREEN - ANOTHER NIGHT

On it is written: The lights on the Eiffel Tower dim to black
as the music continues to play.
Erica sits back, still wearing Harry's glasses. Finished at
last. She notices an empty Kleenex box on her desk. She
tosses it in a hook shot across the room and it lands right
in the trash can.

INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Julian sits on the sofa, shoes off, reading the first half of
the play. A fire burns in the fireplace. Erica approaches the
back of the sofa, holding the rest of the pages.

                    JULIAN

          It's the best thing you've ever written.

                    ERICA

          It is?

                    JULIAN

          It's wonderful. It's sweet. It's smart.
          It's funny.
Erica leans oyer the sofa, reading over his shoulder.

                    JULIAN

          How great is it that I'm not
          intimidated by your brilliance?
Erica gives him a small kiss of appreciation.




                                                       108.











                    JULIAN

          Must we go through this every time?
          Come here...
She leans into him and he kisses her fully and sweetly. She
holds onto the sofa for support.

                                                   CUT TO:


A PRETTY GIRL - WHO LOOKS A LOT LIKE MARIN

eating lunch in Orso's, talking non-stop.

                    PRETTY GIRL

          I'm totally excited about this audition.
          It's such a great part. It's supporting
          but she's a really funny character.
          There's this totally hilarious scene
          where she's dating this like chauvinist
          older guy and just as they're about to do
          it, the guy moans and she thinks he's
          just really into her, right? Except he's
          having a heart attack and she's like
          creeped out and her mother, who basically
          despises the guy, rushes in, gives him
          CPR and saves his life.







REVERSE ON HARRY

choking on his lunch.

INT. BROADWAY THEATER - DAY

Auditions are in progress. On stage, AN ACTRESS reads for the

                     A

part of "The Sister".

                     CTRESS

          Look, we're four sophisticated people.
          Why can't we all stay for the weekend?

ON ERICA'S PROFILE

in the audience. She sits in a row by herself, listening.
Harry ENTERS HER FRAME, sitting directly behind her.

                    HARRY

          I need to talk to you.
Erica freezes, horrified. Turns, sees him.

                    HARRY

          Got a minute?




                                                       109.











BACKSTAGE

Erica and Harry stand in front of a BACKDROP OF THE BEACH.

                      HARRY

            So your play's about us?

                      ERICA

            No, it's about me.

                      HARRY

            Am I in it?

                      ERICA

            A guy like you is in it but he's
            not you.

                      HARRY

            What happens to this guy who's
            ..not me?

                      ERICA

            Haven't totally decided. He can
            live or he can die.

                      HARRY

            What are you leaning towards?

                      ERICA

            Death.
                (Harry reacts)
            It's funnier.

                      HARRY

            He dies of a funny heart attack?

                      ERICA

            He's sort of a schmuck who screwed
            around with our heroine, so it
            won't be too sad.

                      HARRY

            Schmucks are people too you know. Death
            doesn't seem a little harsh?

                      ERICA

            I just went where the story took
            me. It's a work of fiction, Harry.
            Really...just stuff I made up.

                      STAGE MANAGER

                (approaching)
            Erica, we're ready to do the
            hospital, 'Do You Take Viagra
            scene... Should we wait for you?




                                                       110.










Erica nods, horrified.

                    HARRY

          So I'm going to be the laughing stock of
          Broadway.

                    ERICA

          Harry, he's not you. He's a version
          of the truth of you. So to speak.

                    STAGE MANAGER

          Sorry to interrupt again but Dave wants
          to know, when Henry says, "I love ya",
          you want that to be 'Ya', not 'You',
          right?

                    ERICA

          Right.
We now HEAR Louis Armstrong's La Vie En Rose play throughout
the theater. The BEACH backing is 'raised and an EIFFEL TOWER
BACKING is lowered behind them. They both try to ignore the
music, but it's impossible.

                     E


                     RICA

          Well, you look really nice. You
          feeling all right?
As they stand in front of the Eiffel Tower backing, FAKE SNOW
FALLS from above...

                    HARRY

          You know it isn't like I wanted to stop
          seeing you. We could've carried on a fun
          thing for awhile. Why is it you dames
          want all or nothing?

                    ERICA

          I don't know, we're just goofy when it
          comes to love... Look, Harry, if it's all
          right with you, I'd like to be friends

                    HARRY

          I'm not ready to be your friend. How's
          that?

                    ERICA

          Fine. I understand.

                    HARRY

          Anyway, do you actually buy that horse
          shit.. .that men and women can be friends
          once they've had sex?




                                            111.











          ERICA

I'm friends with my ex-husband, but then
again, we didn't just have sex.

          HARRY

We didn't just have sex either.

          ERICA

Then what was it? Love to know.

           HARRY

Can I e-mail it to you when I figure it
out?
     (laughs)
This is perfect. I have given the `Can't
We Be friends' speech for 40 years. I
think I invented the 'Can't We Be
Friends' speech. But you know what,now I
get why they never went for it. You dames
got one thing right. Sometimes sex does
change everything. Call me crazy, but I
just don't see us out on the town, being
pals, having dinner, 'cause I'd bet you
anything, at some point, one of us will
have very unfriend like thoughts about
the other then pass the bread becomes
anything but pass the bread. You get what
I'm saying?

          ERICA

You don't want to be friends.

          HARRY

Not "don't". Can't. Can't be friends.
Doesn't work that way.
    (tries to calm down)
Okay, I'm moving into another phase of
this thing. I'm mad at you.
    (realizes)
It almost feels good.

          ERICA

I think I'm mad at you too.

          HARRY

Excellent. 'Cause I don't like
thinking about you so much and
worrying about how you are and if I
ruined your life or...

          ERICA

-- You've worried about me?

          HARRY

Yes honey, the schmuck who deserves to
die, worries about you.




                                                       112.

                    HARRY(cont'd)
          Sometimes worrying about you feels like a
          full time job.

                    ERICA

          Well, doll, I'm doing fine. So you don't
          have to work that shift anymore.
Again, The Stage Manager...

                    STAGE MANAGER

          Erica, they want you to take a look at
          the costumes for the dancing Henry's.
          These gonna work for you?
Harry and Erica TURN and SEE a CHORUS LINE of BALDING 60 YEAR

OLD MEN IN HOSPITAL GOWNS AND SOCKS.


EXT. THEATER - DAY

Harry FLIES OUT the Stage Door, right into the street, is
almost hit by a motorcycle, doesn't seem to care.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

Harry walks briskly through the park, still pissed, his pace
starting to get to him. He spots a bench with a WOMAN JOGGER
at one end. He parks himself at the other end of the bench,
out of breath. Tries H reason with himself.
                     to

                     ARRY

          God is a woman, I know that now. No
          man would punish me like this.

                    WOMAN JOGGER

          You never change, do you?
Surprised, Harry turns, glances over at the Woman. She drinks
from a water bottle then offers him an easy warm smile. She's
adorable, mid-sixties, short grey hair.

                    HARRY

          Do you know me or are you just talking to
          me as "man" in general, the beast women
          love to hate.

                    WOMAN JOGGER

          No, no, I know you Harry.

                    HARRY

          Oh. Don't tell me. I dated your daughter.
              (the Woman laughs)
          Right? I broke her heart then she married
          some hard working Joe on the rebound, has
          three great kids. What is so funny?




                                                       113.











                    WOMAN JOGGER

          You dated me and you broke my heart but
          after you I met the right guy. I've been
          married thirty-seven years, have four
          kids, eight grandkids and a ninth on the
          way.
Harry now fully turns in her direction, totally clueless.

                    HARRY

          I dated you. .?
              (the Woman nods)
          Did we. ever...?

                    WOMAN JOGGER

          No...we did not.
He looks at her hard but still doesn't remember her.

                    HARRY

          Can you give me hint? A year? A
          decade?

                    WOMAN JOGGER

          The sixties.
              (Harry squints at her)
          You took me to Shea Stadium.

                     HARRY

          To a Mets game?    I must've really
          liked you.

                    WOMAN JOGGER

          You took me to see The Beatles.

                    HARRY

          Oh, God, I really liked you. You're
          Sandra. ..Cook. We did. We saw The
          Beatles together. How the hell have
          you been? What happened to you?

                    SANDRA

          Well, let's see, after we stopped
          going out, I went back to school,
          got my doctorate in marine biology,
          went around the world a few times,
          met the man of my dreams at Oxford,
          married him, we lived in London for
          25 years. I wrote and taught, we
          raised 3 sons and a daughter. I've
          just finished my ninth book and now
          I'm training for my first marathon.
          Now, I must confess, I actually
          remember the very last thing you
          ever said to me.




                                                       114.

                    SANDRA(cont'd)
          You walked me to my door, I was
          tearful and you looked at me with
          those puppy dog eyes and said,
          "Honey, I just don't know how to be
          a boyfriend." Now, tell me, what
          have you been up to since 1964?
OVER Harry's face, we HEAR the SOUND of a SIREN BLARING.

INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

Harry is wheeled through the ER with the gurney. Dr. Martinez
runs along with the gurney.

                    DR. MARTINEZ

          Mr. Langer... Back so soon.

                    HARRY

          This is it, I'm dyin', I've had 20
          minutes of severe chest pain,
          nausea, shortness of breath, blood
          pressure's gotta be 170 over 100.
              (sticks out his arm)
          Give me the nitrate, I didn't take
          viagra.
              (rips open his shirt)
          Plug me in to the EKG, I need an
          aspirin, I'm taking 2 beta
          blockers, blood thinner, Lipitor,
          Procardia and if I were you, I'd be
          pounding my chest. Ow!

                    MALE NURSE

          You're a doctor, huh?

                    HARRY

          Just a very sick man.

CLOSE - THE PAPER TAPE FROM HARRY'S EKG

Dr. Martinez reads it.

                     DR. MARTINEZ

          Mr. Langer, your diagnosis although
          fascinating, was entirely
          incorrect.

                    HARRY

          That's impossible.

                    DR. MARTINEZ

          Your realize a severe anxiety attack can
          masquerade as a heart attack.

                    HARRY

          So I'm nuts? Perfect! The one thing
          I'm not taking pills for.




                                                          115.











                    DR. MARTINEZ

          If you don't want ,to end up in here
          every week, I suggest you do whatever it
          takes to decompress. Try something with
          me, okay?
              (takes his pulse)
          Close your eyes...now give yourself a
          visual image of something that gives you
          a feeling of peace and serenity.

                    HARRY

          I don't know. A hammock...

                    DR. MATINEZ

          Okay, good...what else..?

                    HARRY

          Palm trees...clear blue water...
We hear the SOUND OF LAPPING WATER, SEA GULLS. . . .

                    DR. MARTINEZ

          Anybody there with you?

                    HARRY

          Yes. Beautiful women...in thongs...

                    DR. MARTINEZ

          (disgusted) Okay. What else do you
          see, feel, taste...

                    HARRY

          A margarita...a Cuban cigar.
          ..miles of soft beach.. .

                    DR. MARTINEZ

          Keep going...you're doing great...
And as Harry keeps listing things, Camera MOVES IN ON HIM as
the STEEL BAND gets LOUDER AND LOUDER.

                                         DISSOLVE TO:


THE WORDS. . .


                    SIX MONTHS LATER


FALLING SNOW FILLS THE FRAME

Boom down to see the THEATER MARQUEE of Erica's play on
Broadway. On the Marquee are raves from critics, "****", and
a banner that brags, "Sold Out!".

C




 AMERA CONTINUES DOWN to street level. Couples walk by,
bundled up against the cold. Harry ENTERS FRAME.




                                                       116.










He looks different. He has a beard and has lost some weight:
And in his eyes, a calm we haven't seen before. He pauses in
front of the theater -- loo~s at the PUBLICITY PHOTOS. He
SEES Henry in his boxer shorts at the refrigerator meeting
"Emily" and her Sister. He sees ANOTHER PHOTO of The Dancing
Henrys kicking up their legs like Rockettes. Then, finally, A
PHOTO of Henry and Emily in bed, both wearing glasses. Harry
OPENS THE DOOR TO THE THEATER, steps inside and listens,
hearing Louis Armstrong's La Vie En Rose, then, the audience
breaks out in LAUGHTER. Harry smiles to himself.

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING CORRIDOR - EARLY EVENING

The elevator opens. Harry steps out, looks around for an
apartment number, finds it, rings the bell and clears his
throat. The door quickly OPENS and we see MARIN. She looks
relaxed and happy to see him.

                    MARIN

          I couldn't believe you were calling from
          downstairs.
              (hugs him)
          So great to see you.

                    HARRY

          You couldn't look better.

                    MARIN

          Thank you. Come on in.

                    HARRY

          No, no, I just wanted to stop by and say
          hi and tell you I'm sorry if I ever did
          anything to you that wasn't on the up and
          up or...

                    MARIN

          What do you mean? You were great to me.

                    HARRY

          I was?

                    MARIN

          Always.

                    HARRY

          That's refreshing. Good. Well, I don't
          know what you've done to yourself but you
          look absolutely radiant.

                    MARIN

          I'm three months pregnant, that might
          have something to do with it.




                                                       117.











                    HARRY,

          Really? Who's ..the, lucky guy?

                    MARIN

          My husband, hold on, he really wants to
          meet you.
              (calls)
          Danny...
A Solid Citizen of a Guy joins Marin, loosened tie,
glasses...

                    MARIN

          Harry Langer, my husband, Danny Yellin.

                    DANNY

              (shaking Harry's hand)
          I've heard so much about you...

                      HARRY

          I bet.. .

                     DANNY

          Yeah, with Hthe play and all...

                     ARRY

          I'm famous,huh?

                    MARIN

          Just to us. In every interview my
          Mom does, she always says she made
          you up.

                    HARRY

          So the guy in the play, he doesn't
          make it, does he?

                    DANNY

          He basically dies at the end of the
          second act, but it's very funny.
              (as if that's some
              consolation)

                    HARRY

          Was hopin' she'd give me a
          reprieve, but...

                    MARIN

          Yeah, well...

                    HARRY

          Yeah. Okay...Best of luck, kids...
Marin is stumped by this little visit. Harry heads toward the
elevator, pushes the button, then turns back.




                                                          118.











                    HARRY

          How is she?

                     MARIN

          She's. . .
              (Harry waits)
          Really good.     Up to her old
          tricks.
Learning Italian, remodeling her apartment in the city.

                    HARRY

          Now if I wanted to see her...how
          would that go over?

                    MARIN

              (encouragingly)
          Only one way to find out, except
          she's out of town right now.

                    HARRY

          Oh yeah? Where is she?

                    MARIN

          Paris. She left two days ago, for
          her birthday. But she'll be back
          next week...
The Elevator arrives. Harry salutes his goodbye and steps
INSIDE THE ELEVATOR. He turns, FACES CAMERA.

                       HARRY

          Paris...

ANOTHER ELEVATOR.OPENS

And a clean shaven, dapper looking Harry steps off, cashmere
coat, gorgeous scarf. CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM out of the elevator
and through a BEAUTIFUL LOBBY OF A HOTEL then right onto THE
STREET. CAMERA does a 360 and we catch glimpses of PARIS AT
NIGHT. CAMERA SETTLES ON HARRY just as the LIGHTS OF THE
EIFFEL TOWER POP ON, sending a flood of golden lights high
into the night sky directly behind him.

                       HARRY

          Showtirne.

INT. LEFT BANK BISTRO - NIGHT

Erica sits alone at a table in the back of the room, drinking
a glass of wine. She looks vibrant. She glances up from her
drink and sees what looks like Harry making his way around
the tables. She leans to the side for a better look, to make
sure it's him. It is him and he's corning right toward her.
Her stomach sinks, her mind races... and before she can come
up with a single thought that makes any sense -- there he is.




                                                       119.











                    HARRY

              (proud of himself)
          I knew you'd be here.

                      ERICA

          You did?

                    HARRY

          I've come a long way to see you,
          Erica.

                    ERICA

          You mean we're not bumping into
          each other..? You came here to see
          me?

                    HARRY

          Yes, I did.
              (she seems to shiver)
          I'm aware it was a bold move, one
          of those impulses that grabs you,'
          but...so far, we're okay; right?

                    ERICA

          Well, uh, I mean, I'm just...

                    HARRY

          I'll take that as a 'Yes'.
Harry takes off his coat and scarf, hangs them on a hook.

                     ERICA

          You want a glass of wine or
          something?

                    HARRY

          I was just gonna give you a kiss
          hello.

                      ERICA

          Oh, Okay.
Neither is sure where to go. Cheek? Lips? He lands on her
chin. .Not what he wanted, but he takes a seat across from
her. She looks at him - utterly speechless.

                    HARRY

          I remember you said if we still
          know each other we should go to
          Paris for our birthdays, well, we
          still know each other..".

                    ERICA

          That's true, but, Harry, I haven't
          heard from you in six months.




                                                         120.











                    HARRY

          I know but I've certainly been thinking
          about you. There's a lot I have to say.
          First thing is... I'm not mad at you
          anymore.

                    ERICA

          Good, 'cause I'm not mad at you
          anymore either.

                    HARRY

          That's a relief...since I did come all
          the way to France and everything. And...
          Happy Birthday.

                     ERICA

              (afraid of everything he
              could possibly say)
          Thank you.

                     HARRY

          And congratulations on your amazing
          success...

                    ERICA

          It's been quite a ride. Funny, I thought
          maybe I'd hear from you when it opened.
          Where've you been?

                    HARRY

          After I saw you in the theater that
          afternoon, I had another "episode...

                    ERICA

          Oh, I'm sorry.

                    HARRY

          I was actually okay, but I was sure I was
          dying and the doctor in the ER said I needed
          to decompress. So I did. I walked out of
          there and changed my life, sold most of my
          businesses, packed my bags and moved to an
          island in the Caribbean.

                    E


                     RICA

          That's where you've been all this
          time? In the Caribbean?

                    HARRY

          Actually...No.







EXT. CARIBBEAN BEACH - FLASHBACK

Harry lies on a chaise under a palm tree, drink in hand, Hawaiian
shirt, shades. A steel drum plays in the distance.




                                                          121.











                    ,


                    HARRY (V.O.

          I was there about ,six hours, when it
          occurred to me that wasting away on an
          island in the Caribbean wasn't going to
          remotely cure what was ailing me.
Harry sits straight up into CAMERA.

BLACK SCREEN

A LIGHT POPS ON and we realize we are in HARRY'S CLOSET.

                    HARRY (V.O.)

          So I decided to take another kind of
          pilgrimage...into my past.
Harry ENTERS THE CLOSET, reaches onto a top shelf ,and starts
pulling down dozens of what used be called, "Little Black Books".

                    HARRY (V.O.)

          My thought was -- if I retraced my steps
          and visited all the women I've dated...
He blows dust off of the books.

                                         BACK IN PARIS


                    HARRY

          -- maybe I could figure out how I
          got so screwed up.

FLASHBACK - HARRY'S PILGRIMAGE

Harry STANDS at one FRONT DOOR after the NEXT, EACH ONE

SLAMMING IN HIS FACE.


                    HARRY (V.O.)

          A lot of the women wouldn't see me.
Then, we see WOMEN of various ages SLAP HIM ACROSS THE FACE.

                    HARRY (V.O.)

          Or speak to me.
Harry reels backwards from one Hefty Mama.

                    HARRY (V.O.)

          But I was on a mission to save my
          soul.

                     ,

A Woman In Her Fifties, purposively walks down a SMALL TOWN
MAIN STREET carrying groceries.




                                                          122.










Harry, at her side, keeps talking at her, even though she
picks up her pace and ignores him.

                    HARRY (V.O.)

          My losing streak finally ended when
          I got one to open up to me.
In a HOSPITAL ROOM, an Older Woman on life support, scrawls
out a note and shows it to Harry who sits in a chair by
herside. A Priest stands in the background. The note says,
"As I remember it, you were wildly insensitive". Harry lowers
his head in shame. She places another note in front of him.
It says, "I forgive you." Relieved, he smiles. Then, one last
note: "Now, scram."

                    HARRY (V.O.)

          Hearing what they had to say was no
          picnic.
In an Upper West Side COFFEE SHOP, Harry pas coffee
with a Woman in her Mid Forties. She talks his ear off.
Harry can' t deal with it. He looks away ~ The woman
places her hand on his chin and pulls him right back to
her and keeps talking at him.

                     H


                     ARRY (V .O.)

          But I stuck it out and I listened.
          Then I listened harder.
Harry WALKS down THE STREET with a ANOTHER WOMAN in her
Thirties, who carries a cello.   She never shuts up.

                    HARRY (V. O. )

          And one of the things I realized
          was, I was actually giving closure
          to generations of women.
At the corner, the Woman hugs Harry goodbye.

                    HARRY (V. O. )

          Although I admit, some refused to
          give, no matter what I did. . .

CLOSE - DIANE SAWYER

On the set of GOOD MORNING AMERICA. She glances out the
STUDIO WINDOW and sees Harry ON THE STREET among the folks
holding signs. He HOLDS A SIGN that says, "DIANE, YOU WERE
RIGHT.   I WAS ENTIRELY WRONG.   I`M SORRY."   She looks him
straight in the eye and gives 'him the finger.




                                                       123.











HARRY - FULLY DRESSED - LYING ON HIS BED - TOP SHOT


                    HARRY (V. O. )

          When you hear the same story about
          yourself over and over, your life
          begins to make sense and the future
          becomes your only salvation.







INT. PARIS BISTRO - THE PRESENT


                    HARRY

          It took me six months to find them
          all. I visited 18 different states
          but I came the furthest to see you.
A HAND lands on his shoulder and he HEARS:

                    A MAN'S VOICE

          I don't believe it.
Harry looks up and sees handsome young Julian in a beret.
Harry looks to Erica, instantly deflated..

                       HARRY

          Me either.
Harry stands. The two Men hug, then Julian squeezes in next
to Erica. Harry slowly takes his seat across from them.

                    ERICA

          I should have told you he was coming, but
          I was so engrossed in your story.

                    JULIAN

          What story..?

                     HARRY

          Oh, maybe another time. ..So...
              (looks from Erica to
               Julian, it all dawns on
               him)
          I guess I should've seen your play, then
          I would've Jknown how this ended.

                     ULIAN

          Yeah, big twist, huh? So what are
          you doing over here, man?

                    HARRY

          Just a uh, vacation...never been to Paris
          in January...

                     JULIAN

          It's amazing to run into you. You look
          wonderful.




                                                          124.











                    ERICA

          You do.

                    HARRY

          Haven't been on a gurney in six months so
          that's somethin'...

                    JULIAN

          Well, I've just been to every store
          in the city, this woman is
          impossible to buy for... But I
          think I finally found the right
          gift.
He puts what can only be a RING BOX on the table between
Erica and Harry.

                    JULIAN

          Happy Birthday baby.
He kisses her. Harry watches, dying.

                    ERICA

              (reaching for it)
          I'll open it later...
Harry rises, reaches for his coat.

                    HARRY

          No, no, you know what, I'll let you
          two celebrate...

                    ERICA

          Harry, stay.

                    HARRY

          I can't really.

                    JULIAN

          Why? You have somewhere to go?

                                           DISSOLVE TO:


THE WAITER POURING THE END OF A WINE BOTTLE

Everyone at the table is laughing, mid-meal. Julian is doing
the talking as well as laughing. Harry laughs along, trying
to be an approving part of their romance but he's totally
faking it.

THREE GLASSES OF BRANDY ARE SERVED - A LITTLE LATER


                    JULIAN

          -- To the forces of destiny that
          brought us together tonight.




                                                       125.










Erica lights a cigarette.

                    JULIAN

          What are you doing, you don't
          smoke?

                    ERICA

          I'm in Paris, the second hand smoke
          will kill you anyway...

                    JULIAN

          She's very brilliant, but the woman
          can not hold her liquor.
Julian puts his arm around her, pulls her close.

                    ERICA

          I like that about me.

                    BOTH GUYS

          Me too.
The Guys exchange looks.

                    ERICA

          Now, if I were writing this, this
          is where I'd write, 'an awkward
          moment' .

                    HARRY

          Honey, if you were writing this,
          I'd be dead.
Erica laughs.

                    HARRY

          Never fails to amuse her.
The Waiter drops the check on the table. Harry takes it.

                    JULIAN

          No, Harry, please, let us...

                    HARRY

          No, no, I insist. I crashed your
          party.
              (to Erica)
          At least let me buy you dinner on
          your birthday...
              (squints at his watch
               shows it to Erica)
          What time does that say?

                    ERICA

              (squints)
          I have no idea...




                                                       126.











                    HARRY

              (feels around)
          Wait,' I have my. . .

                    ERICA

              (reaching into her purse)
          Me too...
They each take out EACH OTHER'S GLASSES and put them on.
Erica points to Harry wearing her glasses and laughs.

                    HARRY

          You think you look so handsome in
          mine?

                     ERICA

          You know how long I've been looking
          for those?

                      HARRY

          Yes I do.
Harry hands Erica her glasses. She hesitates. He snaps,
gesturing for his to be turned over. She hands them to him.
Julian watches all this, sobered by their chemistry.

                     H


                     ARRY

              (tucking away his glasses)
          Once again...closure.
              (reads his watch)
          So it's only 5 in the afternoon in
          New York. What do they do around
          here for fun?







INT. NOISY CLUB - NIGHT

Camera finds the three of them sitting at a small table. The
place is dark, loud, crowded and young. They're all drinking
champagne. The air is strained.

                    BOTH GUYS

              (at the same time)
          Want to dance?
Harry gestures for Julian to have the first dance. Julian
takes Erica's hand and leads her to the dance floor. Harry
watches them slip through the crowd. Erica turns back, Harry
waves. Julian takes Erica in his arms, it's clear she's
comfortable in his embrace. None of .this is lost on Harry
and as he watches, the smile on his face more than fades, it
evaporates and everything inside him begins to hurt.

ANGLE - THE DANCE FLOOR

Erica and Julian -- they're sexy together.




                                                       127.











ANGLE - THE TABLE

Harry is gone.

EXT. STREET - PARIS - NIGHT

Harry, with his collar turned up against the cold, walks past
the glass pyramid in front of The Louvre.

EXT. PONT NEUF - PARIS - MOMENTS LATER

Harry walks over the bridge, the beauty surrounding him just
making it all worse. He stops, looks out at the Seine. He
hears a classic French song in the distance, then sees a
small barge, playing the music, pass beneath him. Without
warning, a tear falls from his eye.

                    HARRY

              (laughs at himself)
          At the end of the day, I'm nothin'
          but a sap, a stupid old sap,
          standing on a bridge in Paris,
          crying my eyes out.
He stops, looks at the mighty city surrounding him. Beauty's
not supposed to hurt. Another tear.

                    HARRY

              (almost amused)
          Look who gets to be the girl.
He wipes his eyes on his coat sleeve as SNOW begins to fall.

                    HARRY

              (looking toward heaven)
          Anything else... .

                      ERICA'S VOICE

          Harry?
Harry turns and sees Erica standing by a Cab with its motor
running, snow falling on her hair and coat.

                    HARRY

          Where's Julian?

                    ERICA

          He went back to the hotel.

                      HARRY

          How come?




                                                       128.











                    ERICA

              (walking to him)
          He said when he saw me with you, he
          knew I was still in love with you.
          What do you have to say about that?

                    HARRY

          If it's true, my life just got
          made.

                    ERICA

          Why'd you come here, Harry?

                    HARRY

          Because I realized what I was feeling for
          you, have always felt for you, was
          something I didn't understand, like a
          language I didn't speak...
              (she listens...)
          It scared me so I did what I do. I snuck
          away. Turns out the heart attack was easy
          to get over. You were somethin' else.
              (she's starting to melt)
          And when I went to see all those women, I
          found out I was never really present for
          any of them. And something inside me at
          some point, had just...shut off. That's
          when I think my heart gave out and you
          saved me. I finally get what it's all
          about. I'm 63 years old and I am in love
          for the first time in my life. And that's
          what I came here to say.

                    ERICA

          Okay, this is the best birthday ever.

                     HARRY

          I know I'm no spring chicken, I figure I
          only got another 30-40 years in me. Tops.
          But how 'bout we figure out a way to make
          this work.

                    ERICA

          Okay.

                    HARRY

          Okay? Okay! I'll take it.
The Barge drifts back under the bridge, La Vie En Rose piping
out of it's tinny speakers.

                    HARRY

          Honey, they're playing our song.




                                                         129.










She comes close and he pulls her in, kissing her great. And
as they separate, he smiles, relieved.

INT. CHIC EATERY - NYC - A HOT AUGUST NIGHT

The same restaurant from the first scene of the film - One
Year Later. Harry ENTERS FRAME, just like he did before.

           Langer, party of four.. .and a
           half.
The Maitre'D snaps to attention and leads Harry, Erica,
Marin, holding her Baby Girl, and her husband Danny through
the crowded restaurant. The Baby fusses and reaches out to
Harry who takes her in his arms and proudly parades her
through this swanky crowd to a round table in the center of
the room. Harry beams at the prize in his arms as he sits
with his family for a Sunday dinner.
