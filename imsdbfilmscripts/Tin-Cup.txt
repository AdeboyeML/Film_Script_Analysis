    TINNY CHEATIN' HEART MUSIC, the dull GROAN of a TRACTOR,
    CRICKETS CHIRPIN' love songs, sporadic ZAPS from BUG
    LIGHTS, and an occasional random THWOCK as we --


    FADE IN:


1   EXT. TEXAS - DRAMATIC ANGLE - SUNSET                        1

    Out west where the sun descends gloriously over desolate
    mountains. A sense of timeless and incorruptible beauty
    if you ignore the TWANG of the MUSIC, the SPUTTER of the
    TRACTOR, the ZAPS, the THWACKS... and something else...

    ... MEN'S VOICES.   Garrulous with drink, fraternity and
    amusement.

    We PAN DOWN TO:


2   EXT. DRIVING RANGE - LATE DAY                               2

    A man, JOSE, is on the roof, wrestling with a rickety
    satellite dish, stringing wire, trying to get it to work.
    (We get glimpses of him throughout the scene as he
    struggles with what is assuredly a pirate operation.)

    Four of six floodlights nailed to the roof cast pools of
    yellow into the gathering darkness. ROY "TIN CUP" McAVOY
    stands under the swarm of moths crowding the brightest
    light, hitting golf balls. THWOCK...! Launching them,
    really, into the deepening night. There's a beer between
    his legs. Behind him:

    A group of men forms a semicircle, facing away from Tin
    Cup. These men are the range regulars: CURT, CLINT,
    EARL, and DEWEY. Each man has money in one hand and his
    preferred libation in the other. They're all looking
    back and forth between the bug lights hung on the back
    wall, and muttering what sounds like bets to:

    ROMEO POSAR -- a smaller man, he stands at the center of
    the group with a handful of cash. Romeo is a part-time
    bookie and full-time driving range man. Born across the
    river in Mexico, Romeo is Tin Cup's caddie, confidante,
    best friend.

                             ROMEO
               Okay, all bets are down!

    Their eyes rivet on the bug lights, edgy, hopeful,
    until... ZAP! A BUG is ELECTROCUTED. And Dewey cheers
    triumphantly while the other regulars mutter curses about
    how they woulda, coulda, shoulda bet.

                                                                   2.
                             ROMEO
               Number one is the winner! Dewey
               has the winner. Pays five to two!

     Romeo quickly pays Dewey and more quickly takes money from
     the losers. It's fast-paced, inane, time-killing
     gambling. Tin Cup looks over.

                             TIN CUP
               Don't you shitheels ever get
               bored?

     The regulars flap dismissive palms and mutter in the
     negative as they turn back to Romeo and the action at the
     bug lights.

                             TIN CUP
               ... 'Cuz I got a riddle.

     Tin Cup leads the regulars inside.

                                                   CUT TO:


A3   INT. DRIVING RANGE - LATE DAY                                A3

     Tin Cup holds court.

                             TIN CUP
               Takes about two ounces of brains
               to figure it out. Anyone think
               they got a brain with two ounces
               of brains in it?

     The regulars silently look at each other, reluctant to
     reveal the heft of their brains.

                             TIN CUP
               For Chrissakes, boys! A little
               self-confidence from the players'
               gallery. We ain't talking long
               division.

                             EARL
                      (timidly)
               How much we gotta lose?

                             TIN CUP
               You want to liven things up, Earl?
               That's a hell of an idea. Say
               everyone puts in twenty bucks and
               the pot goes to whoever solves the
               riddle.

                             DEWEY
               You going to get the riddle, Tin
               Cup?

                                                            3.

                        TIN CUP
                 (patiently)
          Dewey. I'm the one asking the
          riddle. I already know the
          answer. I don't getta guess.
          Although... We could say if I get
          to five hundred bounces and no one
          gets the riddle, I get the pot.
          And I know what you're thinking.
          It's an impossible riddle. Well,
          It's not. It's an easy riddle.
          And if somehow by the grace of
          fluke luck I win, and you all
          don't agree it was an easy
          riddle, hell, I'll refund your
          money.

                        EARL, CLINT & ALL
          I'm in... We're in... Count us
          in... etc...

                        TIN CUP
          Okay, a man's driving down the
          road with his son and they get
          in a crash. Two ambulances come
          and take the man and his son to
          different hospitals. Son goes
          into the operating room, the
          doctor looks at him and says, 'I
          can't operate on this boy. He's
          my son.' How's that possible?
                 (beat)
          The clock's ticking boys...

Tin Cup begins bouncing a ball on the face of his wedge.

                        EARL
          Father didn't sneak back in,
          right? He's still at the other
          hospital?

                        TIN CUP
          It ain't 'Star Trek,' Earl.   No
          one beamed him aboard.

That eliminates the most plausible theory in their minds.
The men think harder.

                        EARL
          Well... if the father married the
          son's daughter --

                        TIN CUP
          It's a family riddle, Earl.   Think
          clean thoughts.

                                                                   4.
    The regulars puzzle some more.

                            CLINT
              Give us a little hint.

                            MOLLY (O.S.)
              The doctor's a woman.

    All heads turn to take in the arrival of:


3   MOLLY GRISWOLD                                             3

    Standing just inside the door -- she's a fresh-faced
    beauty in her early thirties, and she's got all new
    everything the sport of golf requires: new bag, new
    clubs, new shoes, new clothes, new visor... she looks
    like she stepped out of an ad in Golf Digest. And all
    the men are asking themselves the same question: what's
    she doing here? The silence invites Molly to supply the
    riddle's answer.

                            MOLLY
              The doctor is the son's mother.
              Feminists pose the riddle to
              reveal how deeply our sexual
              stereotypes run.
                     (directly to Tin Cup)
              I take it you're a feminist?

    Tin Cup misses the ball he's been bouncing, breaking the
    spell. The regulars wait for Tin Cup's response.

                            TIN CUP
              Ma'am, I've been called a lot of
              things -- but no one's ever
              saddled me with that one.

                            MOLLY
              You might try being saddled
              sometime -- the smell of leather,
              the sting of a whip...

    The regulars snicker, enjoying her one-upmanship.

                             TIN CUP
                     (slightly taken
                      aback)
              I'm just a humble golf pro...

                            MOLLY
              You're Roy McAvoy the golf pro? I
              pictured something... different.
              I have a seven o'clock lesson.

                            TIN CUP
              I thought I had a Doctor Griswold

                                                                   5.
              at seven.

    They hurry out to the range, Tin Cup oblivious to his
    gaffe.

    And the regulars gather to look out the window --


4   THEIR POV - THROUGH WINDOW                                 4

    To the range, where Molly is stretching and Tin Cup is
    discreetly waving to the regulars to get lost.

                                                   CUT TO:


5   EXT. DRIVING RANGE - NIGHT                                 5

    The lesson begins. Tin Cup can be slightly condescending
    in these situations, though she's got him a little wary.

                            TIN CUP
              The first thing you gotta learn
              about this game, Doc, is it ain't
              about hitting a little white ball
              into some yonder hole. It's about
              inner demons and self-doubt and
              human frailty and overcoming all
              that crap. So... what kinda
              doctor'd you say you were?

                            MOLLY
              I'm a psychologist -- in layman's
              terms call me a neo-Jungian, post-
              modern Freudian, holistic
              secularist.

                               TIN CUP
              Damn.

    She begins unpacking one of her bags, pulling out every
    golf gimmick on the market -- swing aid straps to pull
    your elbows together, a ball pendulum that hangs from
    your hat, a metal contraption for your feet, etc.

                            MOLLY
              Inner demons and human frailty are
              my life's work. I used to
              practice in El Paso but I've moved
              here now...

                               TIN CUP
              What're those?

                            MOLLY
              I ordered these from the Golf
              Channel.

                                                           6.

He stares in disbelief as she tries to wriggle into some
of this stuff. He's enchanted and dismayed.

                        TIN CUP
          That stuff's a waste of money.

                        MOLLY
          I'm sure there are excesses and
          repetitions here, but I believe in
          the gathering of knowledge and I
          figured, well, there must be some
          truths about the golf swing
          illustrated by these devices --
          and that you'd help me sort
          through it.

She stands there with contraptions coming from every
limb.

                        MOLLY
          I have dozens of golf videotapes,
          too... And a golf watch.

                        TIN CUP
                 (irritated, impatient)
          Take it off. All of it. Now!
          You're a smart woman, for
          Chrissakes -- don't you know the
          work of charlatans when you see
          it?

She deposits all the golf gimmick devices in a pile.

                        MOLLY
          No. I can always tell when
          someone is lying to himself, but
          I'm quite susceptible and
          frequently wrong when that person
          lies to me.
                 (pointing to the
                  pile of devices)
          That stuff cost me over 200
          dollars --

                        TIN CUP
          Then it's 200 dollars of shit...

He tees a ball, hands Molly her driver and steps back.

                         TIN CUP
          Go ahead.   Take a swing.

Molly takes a pitty-pat swing and whiffs, and mutters
under her breath with the ease of a longshoreman.

                                                          7.
                        MOLLY
          Aw, fuck...

                        TIN CUP
          Well, you talk like a golfer --

Molly unloads a mighty second swing. The club head
bounces off the mat. The ball sits untouched.

                        MOLLY
          Shit.

                        TIN CUP
          'Fuck...' 'Shit...' these are
          highly technical golf terms and
          you're using them on your first
          lesson -- this is promising.

                        MOLLY
          Awright, wise ass, show me.

Tin Cup takes the club from Molly, motions for her to
step back, tees up a ball, and rockets a drive into the
night.

                        TIN CUP
          Something like that.

He hands her back the club and tees up another ball.
Molly just looks at him.

                        MOLLY
          Impressive. Y'know, I tend to
          process things verbally. Can you
          break down into words how you did
          that?

Tin Cup takes a deep breath -- this is his speech.

                        TIN CUP
          'What is the golf swing?' -- by
          Roy McAvoy.
                 (beat)
          The golf swing is a poem.

                        TIN CUP (CONT'D)
          Sometimes a love sonnet and
          sometimes a Homerian epic -- it is
          organic and of a piece, yet it
          breaks down into elegant stanzas
          and quatrains. The critical
          opening phrase of this song is the
          grip, in which the hands unite to
          form a single unit by the simple
          overlap of the smallest finger...
                 (displays grip)
          ... held lightly, a conductor's

                                         8.
baton.
       (starts swing)
Lowly and slowly the clubhead is
pulled back, led into position
not by the hands but the body
which turns away from the target,
shifting to the right side without
shifting balance. Tempo is
everything, perfection unobtainable,
as the body coils, now to the top
of the swing, in profound equilibrium.
And then a slight hesitation, a nod
to the gods...

              MOLLY
A nod to the gods?

              TIN CUP
To the gods, yes... that he is
fallible. As the weight shifts
back to the left pulled now by
powers inside the earth -- it's
alive, this swing, a living
sculpture -- and down through
contact, always down, into terra
firma, striking the ball crisply
-- with character -- a tuning
fork goes off in your heart, your
balls -- such a pure feeling is
the well-struck golf shot -- And
then the follow through to finish,
always on line -- The reverse 'C'
of the Golden Bear, the steelworker's
power and brawn of Carl Sandburg's
Arnold Palmer, the da Vinci of
Hogan, the unfinished symphony of
Roy McAvoy.

                MOLLY
What?    What's unfinished?

              TIN CUP
I have a short follow through --
my swing can look unfinished.

                MOLLY
Why?

              TIN CUP
Some say it's because that's the
best way to play through the winds
of West Texas... and some say it's
because I never finish anything.
You can decide. The point is every
finishing position is unique as if
that is the signature left to the
artist, the warrior athlete who,

                                                       9.
          finally and thereby, has asserted
          his oneness with and power over the
          universe by willing a golf ball to
          go where he wants and how and when,
          because that is what the golf swing
          is about...
                 (finally)
          It is about gaining control of
          your life, and letting go at the
          same time.

Molly stares back, exhausted and intrigued.

                           MOLLY
          Jeez Louise...

                        TIN CUP
          There is only one other acceptable
          theory of how to hit a golf ball.

                        MOLLY
          I'm afraid to ask. What's the
          other theory?

                        TIN CUP
          Grip it and rip it.

                        MOLLY
          While I appreciate your poetic
          sensibility, Mr. McAvoy --

                        TIN CUP
          Call me Roy, Molly...

                        MOLLY
          Call me Dr. Griswold...

                        MOLLY (CONT'D)
          Roy... but at this point I think
          I'm more of the 'grip it and rip
          it' school. Hand me the driver.

Tin Cup does.   She tees it up.

                         TIN CUP
          Waggle it, Doc, don't forget to
          waggle.
                  (as she stares at
                   him)
          Waggle... the club head...
                  (shows her)
          ... it's a little relaxing
          ritual...

She waggles the club head, then takes the club back.

                                                             10.
                        TIN CUP
          Let the Big Dog eat!

She stops, lets the club fall.

                          MOLLY
          What Big Dog?

                        TIN CUP
          The driver, the number one wood --

                          MOLLY
          It's metal.

                        TIN CUP
          Yeah, woods are metal -- don't
          worry about it -- and the driver's
          known as the Big Dog and I'm just
          saying to turn him loose, let 'er
          rip, let the Big Dog eat!

                          MOLLY
          Oh.

She swings.   Tops the ball.   It goes ten feet.

                        MOLLY
          This is, without a doubt, the
          stupidest, silliest, most idiotic
          grotesquery masquerading as a game
          that has ever been invented.

                        TIN CUP
                 (cheerfully)
          Yes, ma'am, that's why I love it.
                 (beat)
          And if you hit one good shot -- if
          that tuning fork rings in your
          loin -- you can't wait to get
          back.

She cracks one dead solid perfect out into the night.   It
felt great and she knows it.

                        MOLLY
          I think the Big Dog ate something.

                        TIN CUP
          Did the tuning fork ring in your
          loin?

                        MOLLY
          I wouldn't go that far.

                        TIN CUP
          Always quit on a good shot. We'll

                 (confidentially)
          ... and if ya wouldn't mind paying
          me in cash -- there's a little
          I.R.S. situation I'm dealing with
          --

                        MOLLY
          If you're such a legendary striker
          of the golf ball as everyone says,
          then why are you, at your age, out
          here in the middle of nowhere
          operating a barely solvent
          establishment, ducking the I.R.S.,
          collecting a few pathetic dollars
          to buy your next sixpack -- when
          you're capable of so much more?

Her speech is delivered without judgement or rancor, so
matter of factly that he's disarmed.

                        TIN CUP
          Perhaps I'm chocked full of inner
          demons?

                        MOLLY
          No, you're chocked full of
          bullshit --
                 (cheerily)
          Same time next week?

She heads off to the parking lot.    He stares.

                        TIN CUP
          What did you mean I should try
          'being saddled' sometime?

                        TIN CUP (CONT'D)
          Were you being literal or was that
          some kind of Freudian type deal?
          Molly? Doctor?
                 (beat)
          What kind of saddle?


CLOSE ON MOLLY

As she walks into the West Texas night.    She smiles,
enjoying Tin Cup's confusion.

Tin Cup just stares into the night, holding his cash, until
JOSE'S VOICE ECHOES down from the roof.

                         JOSE
          I got it!   Esta bien!    The flag

7   INT. DRIVING RANGE SHACK - NIGHT                           7

    Tin Cup enters, cash in hand, as the regulars all gather
    excitedly around the TV monitor now coming in.

                            TIN CUP
              A class act there, boys --
              probably the first actual `lady
              type' female ever seen on these
              premises --

              Shut up, boss -- we got the Corpus

              This is yer dead mortal cinch lock
              bet with Do-reen.

    Everyone's glued to the set. A greyhound race comes on
    from a remote Texas track on the gulf.

                            TIN CUP
              Free money, boys, what does
              Doreen know about the fine art of
              Greyhound breeding?

                            ROMEO
              All she knows is she likes the
              three dog 'cause his name is
              Pride of Odessa 'cause she's
              from Odessa.

                            ROMEO
              You gave her twenty to one --

                            EARL
              It's only fifteen to one on the
              toteboard --

              Yeah, but I got every other dog
              in the race. I'm just getting
              even with Doreen -- I'm not

              So how much you stand to lose?

                            ROMEO
              Twelve thousand.

                                                           13.

          Hundred.

                        ROMEO
          Thousand.

                        TIN CUP
                 (panicky)
          Hundred.

                        ROMEO
          You said to shoot the wad.

                        TIN CUP
          I said get even, Pod. I didn't
          say shoot the wad. We better see
          that three dog rolling on his ass.

All eyes on the monitor -- the dogs break.

                        EARL
          Except... if he breaks slow, he
          won't get creamed...

The starting box opens -- "THERE GOES THE RABBIT" -- the
three dog breaks slow and trails down the front stretch.

                        REGULARS
          Three dog's dying, T.C.... easy
          money... (etc.)

The one dog veers wide, going into the escape turn,
annihilating the field. Dogs fly ass over teakettle
like bowling pins, and --

                        REGULARS
          Uh-oh.

The three dog clears the pileup, untouched, hugging the
rail. It has a ten length lead as it moves down the
backstretch and past the toteboard. The race is over --
the three dog wins.

Deathly silence. Somebody flips OFF the TV. Finally,
in a lame attempt to lighten the moment, Romeo speaks --

                        ROMEO
          So, Roy, you were saying you
          felt a little flutter for this
          doctor lady?

                        TIN CUP
          Yes, I was saying that... just
          before I was interrupted by...
          bankruptcy -- a development that
          the 'Doctor Lady,' as you call her,

    Tin Cup and Romeo head toward the entrance.

    Romeo doesn't realize the truth in his own response.

              It's a bad habit I picked up

     knock.

     A voice from inside.

     enter this holy of holies with complete familiarity. And
     there she is -- DOREEN, 35, at least, the classic chesty,
     hippie, big-wigged Texas goddess. She's older than the
     other girls, and more experienced in every way. She's
     smoking a cigarette and finishing up the touches on her
     stripper's outfit.

     Tin Cup and Romeo stand at her beckoning.

                                TIN CUP
               Doreen...

                             ROMEO
               You're looking particularly
               lovely this evening -- This is
               nicer than the leopard suit --

                             DOREEN
               Cut the horseshit, guys. So...
               the one and two dogs always run
               wide and the three dog always
               breaks slow, so I figure there's
               gonna be a big ol' pile of fur at
               the turn and the three dog's
               gonna tiptoe around it and walk
               on home... I was right.
                      (smiles)
               You owe me twelve thousand
               dollars.

                             ROMEO
               We going to pay you.

Tin Cup squirms as Doreen babbles a bit.

                        DOREEN
          I know you're going to pay me.

                        DOREEN (CONT'D)
                 (admiring her own
                  outfit)
          Y'know I finally got rid of the
          leopard suit thing -- it was so
          retro, y'know... it's not easy
          being a post-modern stripper...
                 (beat)
          So... twelve big ones?

Tin Cup finally digs into his coat pocket and produces
some official-looking papers. He hands them to her.

                        TIN CUP
          There. With equity and inventory
          it's worth twelve grand... more or
          less.

Doreen leans forward to examine the papers.    She looks at
Tin Cup with surprise.

                         DOREEN
          This is how you think you can
          settle up? By deeding me your
          driving range?

                        TIN CUP
          Only on condition you don't sell
          right away, and me'n Romeo keep
          our jobs.

                        DOREEN
          What in the world would I want
          with your stupid driving range?

                        TIN CUP
          Equity, inventory, cash flow...
          not to mention an enhanced stature
          in the community, and prepaid
          membership in the Salome Chamber
          of Commerce.

For a moment, Doreen can only stare dumbly at Tin Cup,
caught off guard by this unexpected turn of fortune. Then
she starts to consider the idea more seriously.

                        DOREEN
          What are your labor costs?
                 (off no response
                  from Tin Cup)
          Payroll, Roy. What do you pay

                                                                17.
               your help?

                             TIN CUP
               Let's see... the tractor kid gets
               five bucks an hour. Romeo, he
               gets ten cash --

                             DOREEN
               What do you pay yourself?

                                TIN CUP
               Myself?

     Doreen nods in a way Tin Cup finds threatening.

                             DOREEN
               To hit golf balls all day... when
               you're not breaking for beers or
               corn dogs or to gather the guys
               and lay bets on which crow flies
               off the fence next.

                             TIN CUP
               You're referring to my managerial
               salary?

                             DOREEN
               I'm referring to every nickel you
               snatch out of the till and every
               bag of beer nuts you lift from the
               rack, is what I'm referring to.
                      (beat)
               I'll say it's worth ten and you
               still owe me two.

     She smiles, he sighs.

                You hocked your golf clubs?!


A13   INT. WINNEBAGO - DAY                                      A13

      Tin Cup sits on the couch, swigging Maalox.

                              TIN CUP
                I still got two grand to pay off.
                And I can't see my new salary of
                seven bucks an hour plus lessons
                getting it done.

                              ROMEO
                But your clubs are your livelihood.

                              TIN CUP
                Well the hood ain't too lively at
                the moment.

      A CAR HORN SOUNDS from outside.

                              TIN CUP
                Whoever it is, tell 'em I'm in
                Houston on business.

      Romeo opens the door, and steps outside.

                               ROMEO
                David Simms!   What you doing in
                town?

      Romeo steps outside to greet Simms.   Warily.

                                                      CUT TO:


13    EXT. WINNEBAGO - DAY                                      13

      Romeo and Simms under the awning.   A spiffy new car
      parked nearby.

      DAVID SIMMS, 38, looking every bit like the successful
      tour pro he is... Payne Stewart to Tin Cup's Maynard G.
      Krebs.

                              SIMMS
                Romeo! It's been awhile.    Is
                Tin Cup around?

      Romeo is evasive.

                              ROMEO
                He's on business in Houston... You
                supposed to be out playin' on the
                golf tour.

                                                           19.

                        SIMMS
                 (unfazed)
          Well, you tell him I'm in town for
          my big charity best-ball
          tournament, and I got a spot for
          him when he comes back from...
          whatever.

                        ROMEO
          You got a spot for Tin Cup?   I
          thought you hated him.

                        SIMMS
          Romeo! You wound me. I'm fond
          of the guy, going way back to our
          days at University of Houston,
          when we won all those titles
          together.

                        ROMEO
          He says he carried you on his
          back.

Simms won't be drawn into this adolescent competition --
he's too comfortable with himself and his success.

                        SIMMS
          I didn't have much craft back
          then -- just a little native
          ability. Roy's a great ball-
          striker....

                          ROMEO
          Why you here?

                        SIMMS
          I want to win my own tournament,
          and he can help me if we can
          manage to behave like grownups
          together. Tell him that.

Tin Cup suddenly appears in the doorway.

                        TIN CUP
          What's the catch?

                        SIMMS
          There is no catch. I put together
          a tournament with an elite field
          and a half-million dollar purse,
          and I'm tired of seeing all the
          money head out of town.

                        TIN CUP
          Then make more birdies.

                                                            20.
                        SIMMS
          I need you on my team.

                        TIN CUP
          You ain't that friendly a guy...

                         SIMMS
          We're playing Cottonwood where you
          once shot fifty-nine, where you
          can shoot sixty-five in your sleep
          'cuz you know every bump on every
          fairway, every subtle break on
          every green --

                        TIN CUP
                 (warily)
          You an' me --

                        SIMMS
          Me an' you -- like the old days.

Tin Cup can't quite believe this offer from his old
nemesis but there aren't many options out there. He
grabs Simms's hand and starts pumping it, gushing
with enthusiasm.

                        TIN CUP
          ... Well, put 'er there, partner!
          These two homeboys are gonna show
          the world what golf in West Texas
          is all about!

                        SIMMS
          No, Roy. I didn't mean I want you
          to play with me. I just want you
          to caddie for me, read my putts,
          club me, that kinda stuff.

Tin Cup wilts like a time-lapsing daisy.   His hand falls
free of Simms's. Words fail him.

                        ROMEO
          You son of a bitch.

                        TIN CUP
                 (to himself, blankly)
          Caddie? Me?

                        SIMMS
          I can't bring a guy in off the
          street to play in my tournament.
          It's a big-time event, corporate
          sponsors, thirty dollar tickets...
          I got a network to cover --

                        ROMEO
                 (interrupting,

                                                                   21.
                       outraged)
               This guy off the street, he could
               kick your ass on that golf course.
               Like he kicked your ass in junior
               golf. Like he kicked your ass in
               college. Like --

                             SIMMS
               I'll pay you a hundred for the
               loop, five percent of any
               earnings --

                             ROMEO
               Get the hell outta here! Take
               your goddamn color coordinated
               corporate sponsored soul and get
               outta here.

                             SIMMS
               Okay, okay, just thought I'd offer
               you some work...

     Simms heads to his car.

                                  TIN CUP
               Simms!

                                  SIMMS
                        (stops)
               What?

                             TIN CUP
               I'll take the job.

                             ROMEO
               We'll take the job.

     Simms nods in agreement, and exits.    Tin Cup stands there
     with Romeo, feeling humiliated.


     POV SHOT - SIMMS

     drives away down the road.

                             TIN CUP (O.S.)
               That man stands for everything I
               hate in life.

                             ROMEO (O.S.)
               You mean like... success?

      Banners and galleries and concession tents create the
      atmosphere of a polite circus.


A15   EXT. COTTONWOOD GOLF COURSE CHARITY EVENT - 16TH GREEN     A15

      BILLY MAYFAIR putts out on the 16th green to polite
      applause.


B15   EXT. COTTONWOOD GOLF COURSE - 16TH TEE - DAY               B15

      The two twosomes tee off and the caddies follow,
      including Tin Cup.


15    EXT. COTTONWOOD - 16TH FAIRWAY - DAY                       15

      A leader board reads:   SIMMS/STADLER -10, MICKELSON/
      MCCORD -8.

      A giant gallery lines the fairway and rings the distant
      green which is fronted by a lake, as:

      STADLER hits a three wood toward the green -- the BALL
      PLUNKS in the middle of the lake. The GALLERY GROANS.

      Stadler just shrugs to Simms, as if to say, "I thought I
      had enough club."

                              SIMMS
                Like I told you, it was more'n
                you had in the bag.

                              STADLER
                Yeah, well... I had to go for it
                after your caddy said he could
                get home from here.

      Simms swivels his head around to look at Tin Cup.

                               TIN CUP
                I could.

      Simms looks away, at the shot he's facing: a two hundred
      fifteen yard carry over water. He looks back at Tin Cup,
      shaking his head.

                              SIMMS
                I gotta hand it to you, Roy. For
                fifteen holes you've seemed to
                grasp the concept here: I'm
                trying to win and your job is to
                help me.

                                                            23.
                        TIN CUP
          Five percent of your earnings does
          numb the gag reflex.

                        SIMMS
          Give me the seven iron.   I'm
          laying up.

                        TIN CUP
          You can make that shot.

                        SIMMS
          The smart play's to lay up.

                        TIN CUP
          These fans didn't pay thirty bucks
          to watch a tour star lay up on a
          short par five.

                        SIMMS
          I'm sitting on a two shot lead
          with three to go, and my partner's
          in his pocket. Suddenly, par's a
          good number. Gimme the seven
          Iron.

                        TIN CUP
          No way. You're going for the
          green. These fans paid good money
          to see golf shots they can't hit,
          not golf shots they feel shitty
          about themselves for having to
          hit.

Simms reaches for the seven iron.   Tin Cup clamps a hand
over the club.

                        TIN CUP
          Thirteen years on tour and you're
          still a pussy. Hit the fucking
          one iron, Dave.

                        SIMMS
          Thirteen years in a driving range
          and you still think this game's
          about your testosterone count.

Simms removes Tin Cup's hand from the seven iron and
grabs the club, stepping up to address the ball. Tin Cup
mutters to the gallery.

                        TIN CUP
          Two-fifteen to carry, and the tour
          star's laying up.

And the remark summons gallery voices suddenly urging
Simms to go for the green. Simms motions for Tin Cup, as

                                                               24.
     if reconsidering.

                             SIMMS
               But if you're gonna editorialize,
               do it on the other side of the
               ropes. I got no qualms about
               firing your ass right here, right
               now.

                              TIN CUP
               Fire me?   Hell, I should fire you.

     Simms steps back to his ball with the seven iron, and:


16   Stadler's still standing back where he hit the shot into  16
     the lake. MICKELSON and GARY McCORD, the other team in
     the pairing, are there with him. Romeo, Stadler's caddie,
     stands just behind them.

                              McCORD
                      (to Mickelson)
               I know you could knock it on from
               here, I'm just saying that caddie's
               been drinking muddy water if he
               thinks he can.

                               ROMEO
               He can.

     All the players look at Romeo as:

     Simms dumps his seven iron shot safely down in front of
     the water to a smattering of polite applause.

     Simms tosses the club back to his bag as Tin Cup
     retrieves the divot. And:

                              STADLER
               Hey, Dave!   We in a hurry?

     Simms looks several yards back where Stadler is still
     standing with McCord and Mickelson.

                             STADLER
               'Cause I just bet McCord and
               Mickelson that your caddie could
               knock it on from here.

                             SIMMS
               We're trying to win a tournament,
               pardo.

                               STADLER
               I know.    But I'm getting five to
               one.

                                                                  25.

17   EXT. TV TOWER                                                17

     The ANNOUNCER from the GOLF CHANNEL looks at the monitor
     where a hand-held camera is picking up Stadler motioning
     Tin Cup over.

                              GOLF CHANNEL ANNOUNCER
               From two-fifty from a snarly lie,
               over water, on national TV, with
               no warmup... I'd give ten to one
               to a tour pro.


18   BACK TO COURSE                                               18

     Stadler, McCord, and Mickelson are smiling at the bet.


     This is golf. But Simms snarls at being challenged.
     Stadler drops a ball in the rough for Tin Cup to hit.

                              STADLER
               Here ya go.   Take a hack at it.

                             SIMMS
               Balls versus brains, Roy. You
               hit that shot, just keep walking,
               'cuz your ass is fired.

     Tin Cup mulls over the warning, as:

                               STADLER, McCORD, MICKELSON
               Come on, Roy!    Your fans are
               calling!

     Stadler waves his arms to summon a cheer from the gallery.
     Tin Cup puts down Simms's golf bag.

                             TIN CUP
               How you gonna fire me in front of
               all these people? Especially when
               I knock it on the green.

     And he heads over to where Stadler and the others stand
     waiting.

     PETER KOSTIS, with a hand mike, following the group,
     begins to describe the extraordinary event unfolding.

     Gary McCord moves toward the camera and takes the

               Peter, I've done a little
               background here -- this unfolding
               disaster's a driving range pro
               named Roy McAvoy, who everyone
               calls Tin Cup. Locals claim he
               he was a pretty good college lick
               and knocked around the mini-tours...

20   Tin Cup steps up to hit the shot.   McCord lowers his     20
     voice.

                             McCORD
               ... but I guarantee you, he's
               about to suffer brain arrest.
               He's thinking about the cameras
               and the gallery and the water, and
               all that gray matter between his
               ears is turning to goo... and
               incidentally, Stadler's got it booked
               at ten to one...

     Tin Cup swings, and:

21   The CAMERA PICKS UP the ball arching high and true off  21
     the club. It lands on the green. The CROWD ROARS... and
     the roar becomes deafening as the ball rolls three feet
     from the pin.

                             KOSTIS AND McCORD
               He's not that good... he's
               definitely not that good... (etc.)


22   BACK TO the course -- a scuffle's breaking out.           22

     David Simms helping some guy over the gallery rope.
     Simms walks the guy back to his golf bag... and now Tin
     Cup understands what's happening, and:

                             SIMMS
               Take a hike, Roy -- the loop's
               over.

                             TIN CUP
               You can't fire me. How can you
               fire me? I just knocked it stiff
               from two fifty. Gimme that bag.

     Tin Cup reaches for the bag. The guy holds onto it.
     They wrestle briefly, as Simms sighs with fatigue and
     looks for a marshal.

                                                                 27.

                               SIMMS
               Security!

     Tin Cup gives up wrestling when he sees a couple marshals
     approaching. He turns his anger on Simms.

                             TIN CUP
               What about my money?

                             SIMMS
               You just hit the shot that took
               you out of the money. Welcome to
               life on the tour.

     Tin Cup goes after the bag again. The guy still hangs
     on. The marshals arrive, and begin to wrestle with Tin
     Cup. He goes berserk... a WWF battle royal.

                                                     CUT TO:

     The Regulars crowd under the TV on the wall above the

24   INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT                                      24

     Romeo scoops balls into wire buckets from the garbage can
     of water where the balls are washing. Tin Cup sits on a
     bench, alternately swigging cheap whiskey and Maalox.

                                                         28.
                        TIN CUP
          If I had it all to do over, I'd
          still hit that shot.

                        ROMEO
                 (nods with neither
                  rancor nor irony)
          The look comes over your face, you
          would bury yourself alive to prove
          you can handle a shovel.

Tin Cup looks over at Romeo for signs of an implied
pejorative. But Romeo's just washing and scooping
balls... and looking badly in need of perspective.

                        TIN CUP
          You know why I'd still hit that
          shot?

Now Romeo looks over... and he decides that Tin Cup is
the one in need of perspective.

                        ROMEO
          'Cuz it's the only way you can
          beat David Simms. 'Cuz you never
          got over that he is on tour and
          you are not. 'Cuz you get that
          look on your face...

                        TIN CUP
          No...
                 (pauses, adding
                  weight to his
                  thoughts)
          I'd hit it again because that shot
          was a defining moment. And when a
          defining moment comes along you
          define the moment or the moment
          defines you. I did not shrink
          from the challenge. I rose to it.

Romeo nods, holding his peace.

Tin Cup cringes at the memory, then moves for the high
ground.

                        TIN CUP
          I was playing to win.

               Greatness courts failure, Romeo.
               That's why most people, in their
               whole lives, never ever reach for
               the brass ring, never know when to
               dig deep and try for the

     Tin Cup tosses down another Maalox cocktail.

          In exchange for what?

          My driving range back.

She dances away from him, not exactly sold on the idea.

She dances back to him, reclines a leg on the partition,
and moves her face opposite his.

                         DOREEN
          Roy, I'm not as dumb as my hair
          makes me look.

She twirls off.    He chases her, beer and entries in hand.

                        TIN CUP
          Now wait, Doreen. You gotta do
          the math, and you gotta look at
          how good I'm playing. I hit the
          shot of the tournament at the
          best-ball. They put it on
          national TV.

                          DOREEN
          I saw.

                        TIN CUP

The MUSIC comes to an END.   The club is momentarily
silent.

          It tells me you took an
          unauthorized day off. Next time
          it happens, you're fired. In the

29   EXT. DRIVING RANGE - DAY                                    29

     driver and a bucket of balls.

                                TIN CUP
               Am I early?

               Mr. McAvoy, I can appreciate that
               you have a fairly laid-back,
               relaxed lifestyle -- but I have
               hours to keep.

               A former paramour once ascribed my

               something about floating through
               the universe --

     He tees a ball for her and steps back.   She's staring at
     him, half-amused.

               You amuse me, Roy. But I'm the

               you last time.

     Molly addresses the shot.    Her stance is rigid, overly

                        TIN CUP
          Quit trying to wring that club's
          neck, Molly. Show it a little
          warmth and compassion...

He moves around behind her to reposition her shoulders.

                        TIN CUP
          Remember, this game's about trust
          and touch and letting go. So
          while I'm subtly enhancing your
          technical prospects, why don't you
          tell me all about your personal

                         MOLLY
          It's none of your fucking
          business, Roy.

Tin Cup's hands move down to square her hips.    He's
discreet and professional.

                        TIN CUP
          Your boyfriend's a golfer --
          that's my bet -- and he's why

And, as Tin Cup's hands recoil in alarm...

DAVID SIMMS steps onto the range.

               Man, you are having a bad week.

                             TIN CUP
               She must think I'm such a nothing,
               such a loser... a lousy driving
               range pro living in a Winnebago,
               making five bucks an hour plus
               lessons.

               She don't know you live in a
               Winnebago.

                             TIN CUP
               Well, she sure as hell knows I
               ain't taking her to no Doral for
               massages and mimosas all weekend.
               I gotta do something with my life.

     He reflects deeply while Romeo shrugs.

                             TIN CUP
               I gotta rise to a level worthy of
               the women that think I'm a joke.

                             ROMEO
               Well... you could go out and win

Not just the biggest golf

              ROMEO
What do you mean?

              TIN CUP
I mean it's open. Anyone's got a
shot at it. You just gotta get
past a local and a sectional
qualifier, and unlike Doral or
Colonial or the A.T.T., they can't
keep you out. They can't ask you
if you're a garbageman or a bean-
picker or a driving range pro
whose check is signed by a
stripper. You qualify, you're in.

And then you pay out of your own
pocket to go there and get all
nervous and intimidated --

The mental game. The head game.

You suggesting I err on the side
of excess?

              ROMEO
You always go out to shoot zero.
Sometimes you pull it off. But
you can't play like that at the
Open. You win by taking what the
course gives you. You win by

               be.

     Tin Cup comes over to the couch, sits down, and puts an
     arm around Romeo.

                             TIN CUP
               Well, since you're the authority,
               How'd you like to teach me how to
               be what I ain't and never will be?

                             ROMEO
               You don't ever listen to me.

                             TIN CUP
               This time'll be different.   I
               promise.

                             ROMEO
               I don't know, man. Right now you
               don't even got the money to get
               your clubs out of hock.

                             TIN CUP
               Yeah, well... my sticks may be in
               a pawn shop, but I got a rake and
               a hoe at the range.

32   EXT. MESQUITE COUNTRY CLUB - DAY                          32

     Expensive cars in the parking lot -- A putting green in
     b.g.


     CLOSE ON TRUCK OF MERCEDES

     The trunk opens. A set of expensive golf clubs is
     removed by a wealthy looking guy, BOONE, 40'S. He
     turns to face Tin Cup and Romeo who is reaching into
     the trunk of Roy's Cadillac.

                             BOONE
               Let me get this straight -- you're
               going to play me for four hundred
               dollars with those?

     Romeo removes an old golf bag from the trunk. It
     contains a rake, a hoe, a baseball bat, and assorted
     garden tools.

                             TIN CUP
               And I'll give ya two a side... I
               got the title to my car as
               collateral.

                                                                 36.
                             BOONE
               I'm not interested in that piece
               of shit.

                              TIN CUP
               That's cuz you think of it as
               transportation, Boone. Think of
               it as bragging rights. Think of
               yourself sitting around the bar
               crowing to your buddies about the
               Cadillac you won off Tin Cup
               McAvoy.
                       (the real kicker)
               They'll forget all about the
               Winnebago you lost to me.

33   EXT. MESQUITE COUNTRY CLUB - FIRST TEE - MORNING            33

     Boone addresses the ball on the first tee.

                             BOONE
               No mullies, no gimmes, no bumping
               the ball --

     And he rips a drive down the fairway.

                             BOONE
               Nutted it.

     Tin Cup selects the baseball bat from his golf bag.
     Romeo hands him a pink ball and Tin Cup shows it to
     Boone.

                             TIN CUP
               I'll be playing a Pink Lady today.

                             BOONE
               That little pink fag ball supposed
               to rattle me?

     Tin Cup moves over to the tee markers.

                             TIN CUP
               Not unless I knock it by you.

     And he tosses up the Pink Lady and fungoes it long and
     straight down the fairway.

                                                    CUT TO:


34   EXT. MESQUITE FIRST FAIRWAY - DAY                           34

     Tin Cup stops at his ball, and looks twenty yards back to

                                                                 37.
     where Boone has arrived with his caddie at his drive.

                             TIN CUP
               Yep, I caught this thing way the
               Hell on the toe.

     Boone knocks an iron onto the edge of the green.

                             BOONE
               Drive for show, putt for dough, big
               shot.

                             TIN CUP
               Did you hear that, Romeo? Boone
               was being profound! He has
               revealed to me the essential
               mystery of golf! Drive for show,
               putt for dough...
                      (holds out
                       a palm)
               Louisville Slugger, please.

     Boone's a little rattled by Tin Cup's insouciance.

                             ROMEO
               You got Boone shakin' already --
                      (studying the
                       approach)
               Front left bunker's your best
               angle to the pin.

                             TIN CUP
                      (calling his shot)
               Front left bunker -- plugged lie.

     He tosses up the ball and fungoes a lazy fly ball.

                                                     CUT TO:


35   EXT. MESQUITE 1ST GREEN AND SAND TRAP - DAY                 35

     Boone gazes with malicious delight at Tin Cup's ball,
     buried in the front left bunker. He watches Tin Cup take
     the hoe from Romeo and move down into the trap.

                             BOONE
               I want to see a legitimate swing.
               No scooping.

     Tin Cup holds up a hand like a gallery marshal requesting
     silence.

                                TIN CUP
               Stand, please.     Gallery, please,
               stand.

                                                                 38.
     He addresses the ball, choking down on the hoe,
     positioning the blade at an odd angle. He hacks at the
     ball with an unorthodox chopping motion. The ball pops
     up in the air, lands on the green, releases and rolls up
     a foot from the hole.

     Boone's jaw drops. Tin Cup hit an impossible shot with
     utter ease and facility.

                              TIN CUP
               I'll finish.

     Tin Cup trades Romeo the shovel for the rake, takes the
     pin out of the hole, and pool cues the putt home. Par.
     Boone looks at his own sixty-foot putt and he knows he's
     just been had... utterly, embarrassingly, and thoroughly.

     Without a word he counts four hundred dollars from his
     roll and drops it on the green.

                             BOONE
               Get the hell off my course.


38   EXT. PAWN SHOP - DAY                                        38

     Tin Cup and Romeo emerge, Romeo carrying T.C.'s sticks.

                             TIN CUP
               Listen, swami, your job is to
               teach me patience and humility,
               not to advise me on my love life.

                             ROMEO
               No. My job is to get your head
               straight so you can qualify for
               The Open, much less win it. To
               get your head straight you got to
               forget about the doctor lady.

     They head up the street under a collonade toward Tin
     Cup's waiting Caddy.

                             TIN CUP
               Not all my thinking occurs below
               the belt. I actually stand for a
               few things beside where my next
               romantic interlude is coming from.

                             ROMEO
               Then you got no problem telling
               the doctor lady you can't teach
               her no more till after the Open.

     Tin Cup blinks silently a moment, feeling slightly cornered.

                                                              39.
                             TIN CUP
               That would make an issue of
               something that ain't an issue.
               Besides, I'm focused.

     Romeo responds with a Spanish curse.

                             TIN CUP
               I mean, this is my quest!

                             ROMEO
               Ahhh... your quest... chingaso...

                             TIN CUP
               This is where I stand up for all
               the little guys everywhere who've
               had their fill of soulless robots
               like David Simms --

                             ROMEO
               He may be a soulless robot but
               he's a rich, happy soulless robot
               with a beautiful doctor lady
               girlfriend who's got you by the
               huevos --
                      (beat)
               Besides, how is getting into the
               U.S. Open gonna change what she
               thinks about you?

                             TIN CUP
               It'll prove to her that I'm not
               who she thinks I am.

                             ROMEO
               But you are who she thinks you
               are! Look, I don't bet on a
               horse with a hard-on.

                             TIN CUP
               Hard-on?! Hard-on?! Hard-on?!
               Here, touch me, feel --
                      (as Tin Cup grabs
                       himself)
               I don't feel nothing! Here!

                             ROMEO
                      (embarrassed)
               Hey, hey... shit... cool it...


39   Suddenly a convertible passes -- Simms and Molly,        39
     laughing, carefree, enjoying each other. The couple in
     the car doesn't see Tin Cup grabbing his crotch making
     a fool of himself on the sidewalk -- but Tin Cup and
     Romeo see them.

                                                                40.
     The car disappears down the street. Tin Cup cools off,
     chilled, really -- and full of chagrin.

                             TIN CUP
               Okay, okay... maybe I got a semi.

               Man, ever since I let her dump my
               ass she just can't resist kicking
               me in it.

                             ROMEO
               Maybe you should treat her more
               like a lady.

                             TIN CUP
               After she ran off with that Dallas
               banker?

                             ROMEO
               She did that after you let her

           No more'n you are for that doctor

A couple of deep sighs.   Two losers with fluttering
hearts.

                         TIN CUP
           Great, Romeo, just great... just
           when I need you to be my friend
           and coach, you go get all gooey
           about one of my ex-girlfriends

                I'm no expert, but it seems to me
                that the `pursuit of a person's

                I know one.

                              ROMEO
                Not the doctor lady?

                              TIN CUP
                Why not?

                              ROMEO
                You can't ask advice about the
                woman you're trying to hose from
                the woman you're trying to hose!

                              TIN CUP
                Hose?! Hose?! Get your mouth
                outta the gutter! This is a
                matter of the heart!

                                                      CUT TO:


A42   EXT. MAIN STREET (SALOME) - DAY                            A42

      Tin Cup's Caddy pulls up and   he gets out, goes to the
      front of a store that is now   a health services office.
      He looks around warily -- as   if someone might see him
      entering such a place -- and   ducks inside.

                                                                 43.
                                                     CUT TO:


B42   INT. SMALL ROOM - DAY                                      B42

      It's the exit, "cool down" room, not the waiting room.

      Tin Cup sits nervously, he's slightly overdressed for
      the occasion. He looks childlike.

      The door to the inner office opens -- a woman comes out
      and sits down across from him. She's weeping
      uncontrollably. He stares. He fidgets. He's nervous,
      out of place.

      Finally Molly enters through the same door because she
      hears the crying. She sees Tin cup -- an awkward moment,
      then --

                              TIN CUP
                I didn't do anything!

                              MOLLY
                I know... I know... wait in there.

      Tin Cup slips into the main office while Molly consoles
      the weeping woman.

                                                     CUT TO:


42    INT. MOLLY'S OFFICE - FEW BEATS LATER - DAY                42

      Tin Cup is dutifully lying on the couch because he
      heard that's what you do. He stares at the ceiling.
      Molly enters and sits down.

                              MOLLY
                Roy... are you okay?

                              TIN CUP
                I need therapy.

                                 MOLLY
                Obviously.

                              TIN CUP
                What do I do? I mean... to do it
                ... therapy... I mean, how do I
                start doing... it.

                              MOLLY
                In parlance you might understand,
                just kick back and let the Big Dog
                eat.

      He sighs and plunges in.

                                     44.

               TIN CUP
Okay, okay, let 'er rip...
        (deep breath)
Suppose there's this guy. He's
standing on the shore of a big,
wide river. And the river's fulla
all manner of disaster, like
alligators and piranhas and
currents and eddies, and most
people won't even go down there to
dip a toe. But on the other side
of the river's a million dollars,
and on this side of the river
there's a rowboat. I guess my
question's this: What would
possess the guy on shore to swim
for it?

                 MOLLY
He's an idiot.

              TIN CUP
No. He's a hell of a swimmer,
see. His problem's more like...
why's he always gotta rise to the
challenge?

              MOLLY
He's a juvenile idiot.

              TIN CUP
You don't understand what I mean
by the river.

              MOLLY
We're talking about you and what
you like to call your inner
demons, Roy, that human frailty
you like to blather about, not
some mytho-poetic metaphor you
come up with in a feeble and
transparent effort to do yourself
credit.

              TIN CUP
Y'mean you're gonna make me feel
lousy? I came here to feel better
-- what kinda therapy is this?

              MOLLY
You don't have any inner demons.
What you have is inner crapola,
inner debris -- garbage, loose
wires, horseshit in staggering
amounts.

                                     45.
              TIN CUP
I ain't just some jerk driving-
range pro who drinks too much
booze and eats too few vegetables.

              MOLLY
You're being defensive -- cut to
the chase and tell me why you're
here.

              TIN CUP
Well... I'm smitten with a woman.

               MOLLY
That's good.   Is she smitten with
you?

               TIN CUP
Not yet.

              MOLLY
Have you asked her out?

              TIN CUP
She's seeing a guy. I don't know
how serious it is, but the guy's a
real horse's ass, in my opinion...

              MOLLY
If you shared your heart with this
woman -- maybe asked her out to
dinner -- then it would force
these issues out in the open.

              TIN CUP
I'm afraid she'll say no.

               MOLLY
Ahh... so what you're saying is
that all your speeches about
swimming across the shark infested
waters are really just about your
golf game -- not about your
personal life.

              TIN CUP
Christ, I didn't know we were
gonna get into my personal life!

              MOLLY
This is therapy!

              TIN CUP
Well, jeez, I know, but I didn't
think it was that kind of
therapy...

                                                          46.
                        MOLLY
          What were you expecting?    Ann
          Landers?

                            TIN CUP
          Yeah.

                        MOLLY
          Look, it's rather simple. Those
          risks that you love to take on the
          golf course, the risks you talk so
          passionately and poetically about
          -- you need to apply those risks
          to your personal life with the
          same passion.

                        TIN CUP
          I should ask this woman out.

                            MOLLY
          Yes!

                        TIN CUP
          I should risk coming right over
          the top and snap-hooking it out of
          bounds left.

                            MOLLY
          Yes!

                        TIN CUP
          Risk hitting it a little thin
          and --

                        MOLLY
          For Godsakes, Roy, that's enough!

                            TIN CUP
          Right.   Sorry.

                        MOLLY
          S'okay...
                 (beat)
          Look, just walk up to this woman,
          wherever she is, look her in the
          eye with those big beautiful green
          eyes of yours, let down your guard
          and don't try to be smooth or cool
          or whatever -- just be honest and
          take the risk -- you can do it!

Tin Cup rises with new confidence. He does several deep
breathing exercises, trying to work up the courage. She
stares at him. And he walks right up to her.

                        TIN CUP
          Dr. Griswold -- I think I'm in

                                                       47.
          love with you.

Molly is stunned.

                           MOLLY
          What?!

                        TIN CUP
          From the moment I first saw you I
          knew I was through with bar girls
          and strippers and motorcycle
          chicks, and when you started
          talking I was smitten and I'm
          smitten more every day I think
          about you -- and the fact that
          you know I'm full of crapola
          only makes you more attractive
          to me because usually I can
          bullshit people but I can't
          bullshit you and in addition, most
          women I'm thinking about how to get
          into their pants from Day One but
          with you I'm just thinking about
          how to get into your heart --

Molly was clue-less.   She just stares.

                           MOLLY
          My God...

                         TIN CUP
                 (optimistically,
                   proudly)
          Stunned, eh? So what about dinner
          and we can talk about `us' and if
          we have a future and how to drop
          that horse's ass boyfriend of
          yours --

                        MOLLY
          Roy, slow down --

                        TIN CUP
          Hey! I just hit a eight degree
          driver off a cart path here, I'm
          staring eagle in the face --

                        MOLLY
          This is a terrible mistake!

Tin Cup is knocked off his horse.   Into deep rough.

                        TIN CUP
          I'm acting from the heart so I
          can't make a mistake?! Right?

                                                                 48.
                               MOLLY
                 Wrong.  Aw, shit...
                        (beat)
                 I am one horrible shrink...
                 jeez... I didn't know you were
                 talking about me.

                               TIN CUP
                 Would your advice have been
                 different?

     She's frustrated and at a loss for words.

                               MOLLY
                 Session's over. You better leave.

     Crushed, Tin Cup heads to the door, stops and turns.

                               TIN CUP
                 I'm gonna qualify for the U.S.
                 Open and kick your boyfriend's
                 ass.

                                 MOLLY
                 Please leave.

                               TIN CUP
                 Whatever you think of me, you
                 should know that your boyfriend
                 hates old people, children, and
                 dogs.

     He exits.   She just sits there.

                                                     CUT TO:


43   EXT. DRIVING RANGE - HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT                     43

     The lone figure of Tin Cup stands on a tee, arching SEVEN
     IRONS -- THWOCK! -- into the night, serenaded by CRICKETS
     and the occasional BUG-LIGHT ZAPPING a fly.

     Romeo and the regulars stand behind Tin Cup observing
     approvingly. Tin Cup mutters something with every swing.
     It sounds like he's saying --

                               TIN CUP
                        (just before
                         swinging)
                 Dollar bills...

     Tin Cup hits another shot, totally focused.

                               TIN CUP
                 Dollar bills...

                                                             49.
                        ROMEO
          How'd it go with the doctor lady,
          boss?

                        TIN CUP
          If she was a par three, I'd'a made
          a nine.

                        ROMEO
          Stroke and distance, eh?

                        TIN CUP
                 (nods, deep in
                  concentration)
          Dollar bills...

Romeo backs off to let the man practice, and Clint asks:

                        CLINT
          What's he saying?

                        ROMEO
          Dollar bills. His divots got to
          look like dollar bills. 'Course
          Moe Norman hits divots like bacon
          strips 'cuz he come over the top,
          but that's gettin' too technical
          for you.

Clint turns and nods approvingly to the rest of the
regulars.

                        CLINT
          See that, boys? He's hitting
          dollar bills. Tightening his
          game.

They murmur approval, but Earl catches Clint's eye and
jerks his head at Tin Cup, indicating Clint isn't doing
his job as group spokesman. Clint takes a step forward.

                        CLINT
          Uh, something us shitheels want
          you to know, Tin Cup, is uh, well,
          we been to see Doreen, and we told
          her we'd stage a customer's strike
          if she didn't give you time off to
          win the Open.

This remark penetrates Tin Cup's concentration.   He turns
with a smile to the regulars.

                        TIN CUP
          You perverts did that for me?

                        JOSE
          We believe in you, man.

                                                                    50.

                             EARL
               And if you get past the local
               qualifier, we gonna sponsor you.

     Tin Cup looks at the beaming faces of the regulars and
     smiles broadly.

                              TIN CUP
               Thanks, boys -- a man couldn't
               have better friends. Now move the
               hell back and shut the fuck up.
               You're messing up my
               concentration.

     And with big smiles, they move each other back so as not
     to mess up Tin Cup's concentration. And he pulls out
     another ball, mutters dollar bills, and hits another
     perfect shot.

                                                     DISSOLVE TO:


44   EXT. DRIVING RANGE - NIGHT (LATER)                             44

     Everyone's gone home except Tin Cup, who keeps drilling
     beautiful shots into the Texas night.

                                                     CUT TO:


45   EXT. ADJACENT HIGHWAY - NIGHT                                  45

     A car is parked unnoticed. A figure sits alone, watching
     Tin Cup from a distance. Molly.


     MOLLY'S POV - SOLITARY FIGURE OF TIN CUP

     With his elegant swing,   as graceful as he is crude, a Zen
     ritual. Finally, weary    at last, Tin Cup tosses his club
     in his bag and drags it   toward his ever-present
     Winnebago, which we see   him enter.

                                                     CUT TO:


46   INT. WINNEBAGO - NIGHT                                         46

     He drops his clubs on the couch. The place is a wreck,
     and he collapses in a chair, CRACKING a CAN of cheap
     BEER.

     A KNOCK at the door.   He's startled.

                             TIN CUP
               Debt collection? Process server?

                                                           51.
          Ex-flame? Jesus, I'm clean.
                 (disguises his
                  voice)
          Who is it?

The door opens -- Molly enters. He's surprised but well-
settled into his bath of cynicism.

                        MOLLY
          God, you've got a beautiful
          swing --

                        TIN CUP
          -- And big, beautiful green eyes
          -- I'm a beautiful guy.

                        MOLLY
          I came here to apologize.

                          TIN CUP
          For what?

                         MOLLY
          Well, I counseled you, you did
          exactly what I said, and I just...
          poured cold water over your
          effort.
                  (quickly)
          I didn't get it. I'm a terrible

          never got out of real estate --
          actually I should never have
          left Ohio for that cowboy in

                        MOLLY
          It's not as romantic when you're
          actually with one -- a wrangler,
          y'know -- so of course the oil
          man in Dallas looked great after
          that -- I don't know what I was
          thinking... That's when I went to
          the gulf and ended up in, well,
          trailer sales and then all those
          condos in Corpus Christi -- the
          bottom fell outta the market and
          I needed a new gig --

                          TIN CUP
          A new gig?

           Anyway, I'm flattered you asked me
           out. I can't accept because I am
           involved with David and I haven't
           seen any evidence that he treats
           old people, kids or dogs badly.

                         TIN CUP
           I got a little carried away, I
           guess. I shoulda just layed up,
           made my par, and moved on.

                         MOLLY
           Look, I want to propose something
           -- as long as you understand this
           is professional -- we're not going
           out together --

                          TIN CUP

           I can help you with the mental
           aspects of the game. You've got

           Well, yeah... I'll improve.

           I got no money to pay for you.

                         MOLLY
           I'll trade my services for golf
           lessons and help you through the
           qualifying. If you get into the
           Open, well, you're on your own.

     followed by his Sancho Panza, Romeo. Tin Cup is feeling
     on top of the world, at his cocky best.

to Molly.

                        MOLLY
          He does have the occasional
          tendency towards self-destruction
          it seems.

                         ROMEO
          It ain't occasional and it ain't
          no tendency -- it's a fact of life
          that he gonna blow sky high, it's
          just a matter of when and how
          fast can the pieces be put back

          Behind that twinkle in his eyes is

Tin Cup waves and motions to his team.

                        TIN CUP
          Quiet in the gallery! A man's
          trying to do his job.

And Tin Cup uncoils a mighty drive with an elegant
stroke, fully confident and smooth. The gallery
applauds.

                        TIN CUP
                 (generally
                  announcing)
          Got my 'A' game with me today,
          folks... you're in for a real

Molly leans to Romeo just before they all head down the
fairway and confides --

          I find him mildly attractive when
          he's obnoxious and arrogant like

               Good. 'Cause it's his best

     on a so-so course. With a lot at stake...

     Tin Cup's in a zone, talking to himself, full of himself,
     in a fabulous, indomitable state of mind.

     Molly and Romeo keep looking at each other and shrugging,
     Tin Cup's on a roll and needs no help. So far...

     A couple of the regulars shout out encouragement.

                             CLINT/EARL
               You the man, Tin Cup! You the

          Gimme the lumber.

But Romeo is handing him a two iron.

                        ROMEO
          I think two iron's safer.

                        TIN CUP
          I said I want the Big Dog.

Romeo looks warily down the fairway of a tight dogleg
left par five.

                        ROMEO
          Tight par five, out of bounds
          left... you don't want to hit
          driver.

                        TIN CUP
          I'm not going left of those trees.
          I'm going over those trees... with
          a little draw. That way I get
          home in two. That way I'm putting
          for eagle.

                        ROMEO
          You don't need eagle to qualify!
          You need to get used to playing
          smart -- no mistakes wins the
          Open.

                       TIN CUP
          Qualify? I want the course
          record! Now gimme the lumber!

Tin Cup reaches for the driver.   Romeo shifts the golf
bag beyond Tin Cup's reach.

                        ROMEO
          You not going to listen to me?
          You don't care I'm trying to help?
          You think I'm full of shit?

                        TIN CUP
          I think I'm gonna get penalized
          for slow play if you don't give me
          that fucking driver.

                        ROMEO
          You a head case, boss, always
          were, always will be.

                                                              57.
                        TIN CUP
          Then let's ask the head doctor.
          Dr. Griswold?
                 (to Molly)
          Dr. Griswold, should I hit the Big
          Dog or the two?

Suddenly an OFFICIAL steps forward.

                        P.G.A. OFFICIAL
          Soliciting shot selection advice
          is a two-stroke penalty.

                         TIN CUP
                  (to Romeo)
          Ha!   Gimme the driver and shut up.

Romeo pulls out the driver and he snaps it in half over
his knee. He tosses the two halves on the ground near
Tin Cup.

                          ROMEO
          ... Go ahead.    Hit the driver.

Tin Cup looks at the two halves of his driver, curbing
his anger, not giving Romeo the satisfaction of a
reaction.

                        TIN CUP
          I changed my mind. Gimme the
          three wood.

                        ROMEO
          You can't clear the dogleg with a
          three wood.

                          TIN CUP
          Wanna bet?

Romeo pulls out the three wood, snaps it     over his knee,
and tosses the halves on the ground next     to the driver
halves. Tin Cup turns with amusement to      his playing
partners, lest they think management has     lost the upper
hand with labor.

                        TIN CUP
          Guess I'm going with the safe
          shot, boys.

Tin Cup reaches for the two iron, studies it a moment,
frowns, and then:

He snaps it over his knee. He dumps these halves on the
ground with the halves of the driver and three wood.

                                                              58.
Romeo stares, aghast.   Tin Cup merely shrugs.

                        TIN CUP
          Sometimes I fan that two iron.
          Better gimme the three.

Romeo warily hands Tin Cup the three iron.    Tin Cup looks
at it, frowns, then:

He snaps it over his knee and tosses it on the ground.

Molly leans over to the regulars.

                        MOLLY
          Is this normal behavior for him?

                        EARL
          The word 'normal' and him don't
          collide in the same sentence too
          often.

She watches in amazement as --

                         TIN CUP
          Sometimes I catch that three a
          little thin...

He drops the three iron halves with the other halves, and
steps past Romeo and sequentially yanks all but the seven
iron from his bag.

He snaps them over his knee, one by one, citing the
crimes of each club with mounting absurdity and ire.

                         TIN CUP
          And I've hooked my four iron...
                  (snap)
          ... and hit flyers with the
          five...
                  (snap)

                  (snap)
          ... and skulled the eight...
                  (snap)
          ... and fatted the nine...
                  (snap)
          ... and chili-dipped the wedge...
                  (snap)
          ... and bladed the sand wedge...
                  (snap; then pauses
                   to reflect
                   contemptuously
                   on his putter)
          ... and then there's Mister
          Three-putt...

He snaps the putter in half and dumps it in the pile of

                                                                59.
     broken clubs at his feet.

     Then, he reaches for the last club in his bag, the seven
     iron. The regulars hold their breath, thinking this is
     the end of Tin Cup's Open bid. But...

     Tin Cup smiles and caresses the seven iron
     affectionately.

                             TIN CUP
               But the seven iron, I never miss
               the seven iron. It's the only
               truly safe club in my bag.

     He moves to the tee, drops a ball, and hits it down the
     middle with the seven iron.

                             TIN CUP
               You happy, Romeo?

                             ROMEO
               No, boss, I'm tired... my life's
               too short to spend it watching you
               fall apart. I done it too many
               times.

     Romeo turns and starts walking away.

                             TIN CUP
               What's this? You're quitting?
               First sign of adversity, you're

               Anyone want to bet me I can't par

                                                                 60.

57   EXT. COTTONWOOD LOCAL QUALIFIER - EIGHTEENTH HOLE - DAY     57

     Tin Cup drains a ten foot putt -- also with the seven
     iron, and left-handed to boot. He's past the local
     qualifier.

     The regulars erupt in cheers.   You'd have thought he won
     the Masters.

     And Tin Cup shrugs to the tiny gallery, with insouciance
     and cockiness, and pronounces --

                             TIN CUP
               An easy game, this golf...

                                                       CUT TO:


58   EXT. 19TH HOLE - OUTDOOR BAR - DAY (LATER)                  58

     Tin Cup holds court surrounded by his regulars and much
     of the gallery. He's a local hero -- but Molly's not
     impressed.

     A WAITRESS delivers a tray of long neck beers.

                             19TH HOLE WAITRESS
               Beer for everybody.

                             CLINT
               You the man, Tin Cup!

     A toast is raised to their king, and Tin Cup eats it up.

                             TIN CUP
               Thanks, boys, what'ya think was my
               best shot -- the seven iron on
               twelve, the seven iron on
               fourteen, or maybe it was the
               bunker shot on eighteen which, to
               my recollection was a -- seven iron?

     Much laughter.   This is the Tin Cup they love.

                             EARL
               You definitely the man!

                             TIN CUP
               How'd I do, Doc?

                             MOLLY
                      (cheerfully)
               You failed miserably.

                                     61.
              TIN CUP
What?! I parred the back nine
with a seven iron, I qualified for
the regionals, I --

              MOLLY
Your job is not just to qualify
for the Open, it's to prepare for
the Open. My job is to help you
prepare.

              TIN CUP
You said to 'trust my feelings'!

              MOLLY
I didn't know you felt like
breaking all the clubs in your
bag.

              CLINT
He didn't break the seven!

              EARL
He smoked that seven, brother --

              MOLLY
From what I understand, the U.S.
Open is the most difficult golf
tournament in the world played
under the most difficult
circumstances with the greatest
players -- winning it means
controlling yourself, managing
your emotions, staying cool, not
getting in a pissing contest with
your caddie who, incidentally,
quit.

              TIN CUP
He always quits, he always comes
back.

              MOLLY
Nonetheless, from the mental
aspect -- which is my domain --
you have regressed and are
fumbling somewhere between
delusion and denial.

              TIN CUP
'Regression, delusion, denial'?
You gotta use all this
psychological language?

              MOLLY
I'm a psychologist.

                                                            62.
Tin Cup turns to the regulars for support.

                         VOICE (O.S.)
           Have a bad day, Roy?

Everyone turns to see David Simms enter the conversation.

                          MOLLY
           Hi, honey...

                         TIN CUP
           I shot 65 -- parred the backside
           with a seven iron.

                         SIMMS
                  (intrigued)
           Why?

                         MOLLY
           That's the question -- why?

Silence.

                         CLINT
           'Cause he broke all his other
           clubs.

                         EARL
           Snapped 'em in two -- even the
           putter.

                         SIMMS
           Jesus, Roy, I'm on your side here.
           We go way back... I hope you get
           into the Open, but if you don't
           play under control, you'll get
           slaughtered. Good players shoot
           82 in the Open. You can't always
           go for it.

                         TIN CUP
           Swear to God, Doc, this guy is
           not who you think.

                         CLINT
           It's a well-known fact that if a
           camera's not on him, he treats old
           people and children like dirt.

                          EARL
           And dogs.

                         TIN CUP
           Yeah, don't forget the dogs.

                         MOLLY
           I think we should go, David.

                                                           63.

                          SIMMS
          I think so...

Tin Cup's worst characteristics flare up, he won't let
go.

                        TIN CUP
          You ever shoot par with a seven
          iron?

                        SIMMS
          It never occurred to me to try.
                 (to Molly)
          C'mon, let's go. The car's over
          here....

                        TIN CUP
          I'll bet you a thousand dollars
          against my car that I can beat you
          in any game -- any game, you name
          it -- with a seven iron.

                        SIMMS
          This is ridiculous.

                        TIN CUP
          You a coward? You gonna lay up
          the way you did at the Masters
          last year?

                        REGULARS
                 (taunting, like
                  children)
          Chickie, chickie, chickie...

Simms is a little drawn in, not so much by the challenge
as the desire to shut up Tin Cup.

                        SIMMS
          Any game, I name it?

                        MOLLY
          Oh, come on, David --

                        SIMMS
          I just want to teach him a lesson.

                        MOLLY
          Why do men insist on measuring
          their dicks?

Tin Cup takes her literally and rises, starting to
unbuckle his belt.

                        TIN CUP
          Awright, awright! Let's measure,

                                                            64.
          right now!

                        MOLLY
          For God sakes, I wasn't being
          literal!
                 (beat)
          David, let's go.

                        SIMMS
          Molly, trust me on this one. Call
          it part of his mental preparation
          for the Open, where the rough is
          deep, the greens are slick, and
          the nerves are shattered.
                 (to Tin Cup)
          I'll take the bet.

                          MOLLY
          Oh, jeez...

The Regulars cheer -- this is what they live for. Simms
hands a roll of cash to Molly. Tin Cup hands her his car
keys.

                         TIN CUP
          Awright!   What's the game?

                        SIMMS
          One swing each. Who can hit the
          longest seven iron --

                        TIN CUP
          It's a lock! I hit the seven like
          John Daly hits a three!

The Regulars whoop it up. Their man's a cinch. Tin Cup
pulls a ball from his pocket, drops it right on the
ground in the middle of the patio.

                        TIN CUP
          From right here, okay?

                          SIMMS
          Fine with me.

                        MOLLY
          You guys are really being
          childish --

                        SIMMS
          Molly, leave this one to me.

                        TIN CUP
          Dr. Griswold, I know what I'm
          doing.

Tin Cup takes a couple of swings to limber up, aiming out

                                                            65.
onto an open area of the course.   Serious, intent, the
look of eagles...

                        TIN CUP
                 (to himself)
          Dollar bills...

He takes a full back-swing, opens beautifully, and
launches a seven iron like a rocket out toward some
driving range markers... to "oohs" and "ahhs" from his
faithful.

The ball lands at a 170 yard marker and bounces further.

                        CLINT
          Them signs are at least thirty
          yards farther -- that ball musta
          gone 220...

                        TIN CUP
          That ball's about 2-2-7... toed it
          a bit... but it'll do...

                        REGULARS
          Nearly 230 with a seven!    Pureed
          it, baby, he pureed it!

Tin Cup hands Simms the seven iron.

                        TIN CUP
          Take a minute to limber up, fine
          with me --

                           SIMMS
          Don't need to.

Simms is still in a sport jacket, slacks, no golf shoes.

                        TIN CUP
          Take your jacket off?

                        SIMMS
          No, no, I'm fine.

Simms drops a ball about where Tin Cup's sat.   He stands
above the ball and addresses it.

                         TIN CUP
                  (cockily)
          You're gonna need to muscle up,
          big guy -- give it the old steroid
          jerk...

Simms is cool as ice. He smiles, then moves around to
the other side of the ball, suddenly facing away from the
course. This baffles everyone.

                                                                 66.
                             REGULARS
               What the hell you doin'?    Wha's
               this?

     And David Simms hits an effortless seven iron out toward
     the desert, onto the lonely highway...

59   ... and the ball bounces and bounces and bounces, for    59
     About three miles, forever. It's probably still going...

     The hustler's been hustled.


     CLOSE ON MOLLY

     She shrugs and smiles.

                                                     CUT TO:


61   EXT. COTTONWOOD CLUBHOUSE - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)             61

     Molly drives away in Simms' car -- followed by Simms in
     Tin Cup's Cadillac convertible. Simms waves.

     Tin Cup and the Regulars stand alone. Weakly, lamely, a
     couple of the Regulars speak. Without conviction.

                             CLINT
               You the man, Roy...

                             EARL
               You definitely the man...

                                                     CUT TO:


62   INT. GOLDEN TASSEL - NIGHT                                  62

     A nearly nude dancer named SAMMANTHA on stage to a big
     Saturday night crowd. Tin Cup's in the front row,
     sitting with Doreen and a beer. Disconsolate.

                             P.A. ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
               Bring out those bills, boys, if ya
               wanta see a little more of
               Sammantha!

     Guys pull out singles and larger bills around the runway,
     placing them on the railing for the gyrating stripper.

                             SAMMANTHA
                      (to Tin Cup)
               Hey, honey...

                                                      67.

Tin Cup tosses some money onstage with a lackluster
wave, he's depressed -- or something.

                           TIN CUP
          Hey, honey...

                        DOREEN
          I heard you qualified for the
          Regionals -- why you so down?

                        TIN CUP
          I broke my clubs -- don't ask why,
          my caddie's pissed off at me, I
          lost my wheels in a sucker bet,
          and my shrink thinks I'm a fool --
          'cause I probably am...

                        DOREEN
          You're seeing a therapist?!

                        TIN CUP
          Yeah, what's wrong with that?

                        DOREEN
          Only way you'd ever go into
          therapy was if the shrink was a
          doll and you were trying to get
          her into the rack --

                        TIN CUP
          You're so shallow. The Good
          Doctor and I are dealing with my
          regression and denial --

                         DOREEN
          Oh, Tin Cup, what a crock.    You
          got a hard-on.

A GUY from the next table leans over, interrupting.

                           GUY
          You `Tin Cup'?     Won the Local with
          a seven iron?

                           TIN CUP
          That's me.

                         GUY
          McAvoy?   The Tin Cup McAvoy?

                        DOREEN
          There's only one -- thank God...

                         TIN CUP
          Yeah.   You looking for a game?

                                                            68.
                        GUY
          No, but I'd sure like to show you
          my grip...

Doreen can't keep his attention. Neither can Sammantha,
who writhes only a few feet away.

                         DOREEN
          How long have you been seeing this
          `Good Doctor'?

                        TIN CUP
          Excuse me, Dor', the man's having
          trouble with his grip --

The Guy slides over to Tin Cup, quickly joined by his
buddies.

                        GUY
          See, I used to play a real weak
          grip. But you look at Couples,
          he's got a left hand way over
          here...

Tin Cup glances at the guy's grip.

                        TIN CUP
          No, grip it like this, so you're
          holding on with the last two
          fingers of your left hand.

The Guy nudges the COWBOY next to him.

                        GUY
          See that? Tin Cup McAvoy says you
          grip a golf club like this, with
          these two fingers.

                         DOREEN
          Roy?
                  (off no response)
          Roy?   Tin Cup? Hello?

                        TIN CUP
          The grip and address are about 90
          percent of the golf swing, so pay
          attention here...

                        COWBOY
          When you're done with him, can I
          ask you about my club position at
          address?

Sammantha can't keep their attention, either, even though
she's down to a G-string, inches away. At the height of
the MUSIC, she stops dancing and looks down at Doreen --

                                                                 69.
                             SAMMANTHA
               Am I doing something wrong?

                             DOREEN
               No, honey, you ain't -- but a
               healthy woman's only got two
               choices in this world of ours...
                      (beat)
               Either fall in love with another
               woman -- or take up golf.

     And Doreen heads to the dressing room, disgusted, but not
     at all surprised. She knows Tin Cup -- she knows men.

                             TIN CUP
               ... Now the stronger right-hand
               grip can help ya draw the ball,
               which I plan to do at the
               Regionals next week in Tulsa...
               just shift the hand over a little
               bit... blah, blah, blah...

     ... And naked women dance before them, unnoticed.

                                                    CUT TO:


63   EXT. ROUTE 66 (SOMEWHERE IN SOUTHWEST) - DAY                63

     The WINNEBAGO CHUGS along in the middle of nowhere.


64   INT. WINNEBAGO - DAY                                        64

     Tin Cup drives, as most of the Regulars lounge -- all are
     there including Turk (the bouncer). But Romeo is
     missing.

                             CLINT
               We get through the next 36 holes
               and we in the Open!

                             EARL
               I got the yips and I ain't even
               teeing it up...

                             TIN CUP
               Nothing to worry about, boys --

                             JOSE
               But you ain't got Romeo?

                              TIN CUP
               Don't need him till the Open --
               he'll be back.

                                                                   70.
                             CLINT
               But you don't got the doctor lady?

                             TIN CUP
               Oh no, I got her. Right here.

     He holds up a tape cassette.

                             TIN CUP
               She can't travel to Arizona for
               the Regionals -- she's got a busy
               practice, y'know... so she made me
               this tape to play while I'm out
               there... keep me calm, cool, and
               collected...

                               EARL
               What's on it?

                             TIN CUP
               A little James Taylor, little
               George Jones, little Kahlil
               Gibran, little this, little
               that... and a lotta the voice of
               the smartest chick I ever met.

                             EARL
               The good doctor herself...

                             CLINT
               Can we hear it or is it personal?

                             TIN CUP
               Since when is therapy personal,
               eh?

     He punches into his deck and the Winnebago is filled with
     the sounds of MOLLY'S TAPE, beginning with George
     Jones...

     ... and the voice of GEORGE JONES takes us into...

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:


65   EXT. LA PALOMA GOLF CLUB (ARIZONA) - DAY                      65

     The Regional Qualifier -- 36-hole tournament pitting all
     the local winners. This is a much bigger deal than the
     local tournament -- more commercial, bigger crowds,
     tougher.


     MONTAGE OF REGIONALS

     Accompanied by MOLLY'S VOICE and the MUSIC of JONES,
     TAYLOR, OTHERS.

                                                                71.


     CLOSE ON TIN CUP

     He puts the Walkman headset over his ears on the first
     tee. We hear what he hears, and --

                              MOLLY (V.O.)
                       (on tape)
                ... `Private victories precede
                public victories. You cannot
                harvest a crop before you plant
                it...'

     Kaboom!   He launches a tee shot down the middle.

                              MOLLY (V.O)
                       (on tape)
                ... `How you view the problem, is
                the problem...'


66   TIN CUP chips into the cup.                                66


67   TIN CUP drains putt after putt with confidence.            67

                              MOLLY (V.O.)
                       (on tape)
                ... `Follow your bliss...'


68   TIN CUP takes a club from Earl who's huffing and           68
     puffing a little too hard for a caddie, and --

     Tin Cup crisps a three iron over water to a tight green.

     Tin Cup is carrying his own bag now -- Earl is several
     paces behind, dragging his body slowly, exhausted.


69   CLOSE ON SCOREBOARD -- Even par, even, even, one           69
     under...

                              MOLLY (V.O.)
                       (on tape)
                ... `Say not that I have found the
                truth but that I have found a
                truth...'


70   CLOSE ON TIN CUP -- Still in a zone, confident,            70
     relaxed, hitting lots of good shots. But the score is
     close, the competition tougher. He's near the top,
     but not first.

                                                                72.
71   TIN CUP lips out a fifteen-foot putt -- heartbreak.        71
     He starts to lose it, but...

                             MOLLY (V.O.)
                      (on tape)
               ...`You can't have the fruits
               without the roots...'

     And Tin Cup just smiles and taps in.


72   SCOREBOARD tells us we're down to the 36th, final hole.    72


73                           TIN CUP                            73
               Whattya think, Earl?

                             EARL
               I think three under will qualify.
               You need birdie. I could shit.

                             TIN CUP
               A little more confidence there,
               Earl...

                             EARL
               I wish Romeo was here. I ain't
               cut out to do this. I'm a
               spectator by nature. An observer.
               I'm a --

                             TIN CUP
               Shut up and hand me the Big Dog.

                             EARL
               You got it.

     Tin Cup takes the driver and uncoils a beauty.

                             TIN CUP
               The Force is with me, pods...

                                                      CUT TO:


74   TIN CUP hits a wedge approach -- the ball lands inches     74
     from the hole. The crowd gasps... but --

     The backspin grabs it and the ball spins back and back
     and back, ten, twenty, thirty feet before coming to a
     rest.

     The men head solemnly to the final green.

                                                      CUT TO:

                                                                 73.
75   EXT. LA PALOMA - 18TH GREEN - DAY                           75

     Tin Cup surveys the thirty-foot snake of a putt.   Earl's
     of absolutely no use.

                              TIN CUP
               We need this one big time, Earl,
               whattya think?

                             EARL
                      (unsurely)
               Looks straight to me.

                             TIN CUP
               Straight?! Thing's a roller
               coaster breaks four ways and dies
               at the hole -- you're blind!

                             EARL
               Actually, I am blind... 20-60 in
               one eye -- and that's the good
               eye...

                              TIN CUP
               I got a blind caddie... just hold
               the stick, Earl -- and be sure to
               pull it out...

     Tin Cup studies the hell out of this putt. If it goes
     in, he's in the Open. He misses, back to Salome.

                             MOLLY (V.O.)
                      (on tape)
               ... when the going gets tough,
               the, the, the, whirrrrrrrrrrr,
               the, the...

     Tin Cup shakes the Walkman and pounds his ears.

                             TIN CUP
               Doc?  Doc?
                      (panicky)
               Earl, Earl -- the tape's jammed!
               She's abandoning me!

                               MARSHAL
               Are you okay?

                             TIN CUP
               Yeah, yeah... I'm flying solo
               now...

                               MARSHAL
               What?

                             TIN CUP
               I gotta make this putt.

                                                                 74.

                             MARSHAL
               Obviously.

     Tin Cup stares endlessly at the long putt.

                             TIN CUP
               ... just pick the line, feel the
               speed -- bad timing, doc, Jesus...

     He steps up to the putt, still talking to himself.

                             TIN CUP
               Like a million others you made in
               your life, Roy. Just see it going
               in. Just feel it... right in the
               back of the jar... just pull the
               goddamn trigger, you pussy...


76   He strokes the putt -- It starts right, curls back          76
     left, straightens out, over the ridge, back again,
     endlessly...

                             TIN CUP
               Pull the stick, Earl, pull it!

     Earl's having trouble with the flagstick, shaking it,
     panicking, and finally -- he snaps it free, but...

     The ball stops dead on the lip of the cup.

     Tin Cup contorts in anguished body-English, then falls to
     his back like a shot animal.

                             TIN CUP
               Choking dogs die!

     And the BALL falls into the cup with a CLICK -- and a
     ROAR.

     Tin Cup takes a peek at the cup.   The ball stays in the
     hole.

                                                    CUT TO:


77   EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT                                        77

     The Winnebago returns home, a travelling party of beer,
     boisterousness, and celebration. We hear them all, led
     by Turk the bouncer and his guitar, singing "The Double
     bogey Blues"... all the way back to Texas.

                                                    CUT TO:

                                                             75.
78   EXT. DRIVING RANGE - DAY                                78

     Tin Cup arrives, fresh from the qualifier.   Romeo is
     shafting glubs.

                             TIN CUP
               Romes!  You've come back!
                      (no answer)
               You shoulda been there, Romes, I
               drained a 30-foot snake to
               qualify!
                      (off no answer)
               Earl gave me a straight read --
               the thing broke half a dozen times
               -- missed ya, pods!

     Romeo gives him the silent treatment.

                             TIN CUP
               Okay, don't talk to me -- but
               you're still my guy...
                      (losing patience)
               It's a little late to be pissed
               off! We're in the Open! You and
               me!

     Still nothing from Romeo.

                             TIN CUP
               Awright, be that way --
                      (switches course)
               -- say... has Molly been around?

                             ROMEO
               I knew you had the hots for her.

                             TIN CUP
               What's this? Garbo speaks? Of
               course I have the hots for her and
               I'm doing a damn good job of
               keeping things platonic and
               professional till I kick Simms'
               ass and show her I ain't who she
               thinks I am because, in fact, I am
               who she thinks I am but if I win
               the Open I won't be.

     Romeo stares back at that curious logic.

                             ROMEO
               Well, I don't think her nor me nor
               the God of Golf his self can keep
               you from blowing up in the Open...

                             TIN CUP
               I made it this far! I just got to
               hold it together for 72 more

                                               76.
           holes!

                         ROMEO
           There's a lotta triple bogeys out
           there waiting to grab your ass.

                         TIN CUP
                  (cheerily)
           You're complaining again! Romeo's
           back! Whining, bitching, pissed
           off -- you're my man!

Silence.   Some chagrin.

                         ROMEO
           You didn't fall in love with Earl
           to be your caddie?

                         TIN CUP
           He was a wheezing heart attack
           waiting to happen -- cost me
           three strokes a side...
                  (beat)
           I carried my bag the last four
           holes. I love ol' Earl but I need
           you.

                         ROMEO
           You don't love me?

                         TIN CUP
                  (exasperated)
           I love you, too, God damn it!

                         ROMEO
           As much as Earl?

                         TIN CUP
           I don't know! Yes, yes, as much
           as Earl --
                  (beat)
           More than Earl!

                           ROMEO
           Am I special?

                         TIN CUP
           If you can remove the sexual
           connotations and overlay a golf
           theme, Romeo -- I am your Juliet.

Romeo ponders it all.

                         ROMEO
           Muy bien, Julietta. In that case
           -- I am your caddy once again.

                                                                   77.
                             TIN CUP
               Podnuh.

     They shake hands.

                             TIN CUP
               Awright... now that we got that
               bullshit outta the way, I'm gonna
               hit me some balls and start oilin'
               that sweet swing o' mine for the
               big boys...

     Romeo sits back in the shade, still washing the thousands
     of golf balls in the rack, watching as --


79   Tin Cup drops a bucket of balls on the hardscrabble           79
     ground, pulls out a club and limbers up.

                             TIN CUP
               Nobody heard from Molly, eh?

                             ROMEO
               You got it bad, don't ya?

                             TIN CUP
               Somethin' about that chick...

     Tin Cup addresses the ball and takes a swing.    Everything
     looks normal in his swing, but...

     Thwock! -- the BALL squirls off to the side and RATTLES
     against a fence. Ugly.

                             TIN CUP
               Hmmm... little chili dipper
               there...

                             ROMEO
               Be sure to do that in the Open.

     Unfazed, Tin Cup steps up to hit again, but... once
     more --

     Thwock! -- Another horrible-looking squib to the right.

     Romeo stops washing balls and notices, watching Tin Cup.

     Thwock, thwock! -- Something's terribly wrong.


     CLOSE ON TIN CUP

     Concern crosses his face.

                             TIN CUP
               Romeo!

                                                                   78.

                               ROMEO
               I'm watching.

                             TIN CUP
               It ain't no chili dipper.

                             ROMEO
               Yeah, boss, you got the 'S' word.

                             TIN CUP
               What am I doing wrong?

                             ROMEO
               Shanks are like a virus -- they
               just show up. Nobody can figure
               'em out.

     Thwock, thwock, thwock! -- Three more chili dippers.   Our
     man definitely has the shanks. And he's panicking.

                              TIN CUP
               Romes!   Something's terribly
               wrong.   What's your guess?!

                             ROMEO
               It's the woman.

                             TIN CUP
               I thought you said it was a virus?

                             ROMEO
               A woman can have the same effect.

                               TIN CUP
               What do I do?

                             ROMEO
               Keep swinging...

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:


80   EXT. RANGE - THAT NIGHT (MUCH LATER)                          80

     Thwock, thwock, thwock! -- Night has fallen and he still
     has the shanks.

     The regulars have gathered and are huddled, murmuring.
     The word has spread like wildfire -- Tin Cup has the
     shanks.

                             CLINT
               Never thought it would happen...

                             EARL
               The shanks is for us mortals, not

                                                          79.
          for the great ones...

                        JOSE
          Esta muy feo... muy, muy feo...

(It is very ugly, very, very ugly...)

Tin Cup angrily throws his club out into the night and
turns to the regulars.

                        TIN CUP
          Y'know why they named this game
          'golf'? 'Cause the words 'fuck'
          and 'shit' were already taken!

A CAR HORN HONKS -- All heads turn to see:


POV SHOT - PINK CORVETTE

pulls in -- Doreen gets out, carrying a big package.

                           DOREEN
          Hiya, fellas!

                        TIN CUP
          What is this? Everybody like to
          watch a train wreck?!

Doreen approaches the regulars, and we notice for the
first time that there are a number of bags and packages
with the boys.

                        DOREEN
          He's in one of his pleasant moods,
          I see --

                        ROMEO
          He's got the shanks. We got the
          makings of a Greek tragedy here.

                        DOREEN
                 (shouting to
                  Tin Cup)
          Quit whining and get over here.
          We've got something for you.

Tin Cup drags his sorry ass to the group.

                        TIN CUP
          Unless it's a 'swing thought,' I'm
          not interested...

                        DOREEN
                 (ignoring his
                  attitude)
          We're here to sponsor you in the

                                                            80.
          Open. Me an' the boys have pooled
          our resources and come up with
          some cash so you can look and feel
          as spiffy as all them big-name
          pros.

                        TIN CUP
          But I got the shanks --

                        DOREEN
          Yeah, and you obviously still have
          a hard-on for the doctor chick --
          your face is all screwed up and
          tight like you haven't been laid
          in awhile --

                        TIN CUP
          Is it really that obvious?

                        DOREEN
          It's not a good look for you.
          Roy, your heart is not the only
          organ you wear on your sleeve.
          There's a certain, vulgar appeal
          to your transparency.

Tin Cup shrugs.   She always has him outflanked.

                        CLINT
          C'mon, Tin Cup, we're trying to
          make you a presentation --

                        TIN CUP
          Awright, awright...

She unwraps a tour golf bag -- Big gold and red lettering
advertises "The Golden Tassel." Pastie tassels hang from
all over the bag. Doreen sets it down proudly.

                        DOREEN
          I got the Golden Tassel to sponsor
          you at the Open.

                        TIN CUP
          You expect me to pack that around?

                        ROMEO
          I'm carrying the bag.

                        DOREEN
          It's worth four hundred dollars
          endorsement money to you --

Earl steps forward with a golf shirt bedecked with sewn
on patches and logos.

                                                        81.
                        EARL
          See, Dewey got you First State
          Banking of Salome, and Clint got
          you Short-Haul Trucking and I got
          you Brink and Brown sanitation --

                        TIN CUP
          I'm being sponsored by a sewage
          disposal system?

                        EARL
          We call it human resources
          management, Roy, please...

Jose steps forward with a golf cap, also emblazoned.

                        JOSE
          I've got Wally's Smokehouse for ya
          -- kind of a nice sign...

                        DEWEY
          And since I couldn't get the post
          office to come aboard, me and my
          girl friend Muriel's gonna buy a
          fan club patch you can put anywhere
          you want.

Doreen and the regulars look at Tin Cup proudly.

                        TIN CUP
          I'm supposed to wear this shit?

                        JOSE
          This shit is us, man.   You can't
          win without us.

                        DOREEN
          You're the pride of Salome!

                        TIN CUP
          Hell, I won't even make the cut!

                        DOREEN
          What happened to your confidence?

                        ROMEO
          He's shanking his love life so
          he's shanking the golf ball.

                        DOREEN
          Must be true love.

                          ROMEO
          He's a goner.

Tin Cup surveys all the bizarre sponsorship loot, and
starts loosening up. These are his people, after all,

                                                                   82.
     and they're behind him all the way.

                             TIN CUP
               Look, everybody, this is great.
               I'm sorry I'm acting so pathetic
               but my swing's never abandoned me
               before. I just need a little time
               to work it out.

                             EARL
               Anything you want --

                             CLINT
               Give him some room, boys --

                             TIN CUP
                      (to anyone who'll
                       listen)
               Maybe it's my grip... maybe I'm
               opening up too soon... too late...
               coming over the top... no,
               dropping underneath...
                      (beat)
               Oh, sweet Jesus, why have you
               abandoned me?

                             DOREEN
                      (to the regulars)
               He's trying to talk to God.   It's
               time for us to go.

     Doreen and the regulars quietly slip away to leave Tin
     Cup with his newly sponsored gifts and, more importantly,
     his newly lost grip, swing, and confidence.

                             ROMEO
               You want me to stay, boss?

                             TIN CUP
               I need to be alone.

                             ROMEO
               You got it.

     And Romeo herds the rest of them out to their cars in the
     lot. And as they drive away, Tin Cup sits down, his head
     in his hands.

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:


81   EXT. RANGE - NEXT MORNING                                     81

     The Winnebago sits forlornly in the parking lot next to
     the range which has never looked lonelier.

     Tin Cup's Caddy convertible pulls up to the Winnebago.

                                                                   83.
     But Roy isn't driving -- Molly is.    She gets out, goes to
     the door.

     She knocks.

                              MOLLY
               Roy?   Anybody home?

     There's no answer so she tries the door, and walks in on:

                                                     CUT TO:


82   INT. WINNEBAGO - MORNING                                      82

     Tin Cup stands there caught, like a deer in the
     headlights, like a man caught cross dressing, a private
     confession made public -- he can't run and he can't
     hide...

     Roy "Tin Cup" McAvoy is wearing every gimmick that Molly
     first arrived with -- plus many more. He wears a
     pendulum cap, his arms are strapped together, a curious
     triangular coat hanger type contraption connects his
     elbows, there's a neck brace, an ankle anchor, an arrow
     attachment to his left hand, a bucket for right foot, he
     swings a collapsible club... and a BEGINNERS GOLF VIDEO
     PROJECTS loudly from his VCR, so loudly that he never
     heard her knocking.

                                MOLLY
               My God...

                                TIN CUP
               Aarghh...

                                MOLLY
               Roy...

                             TIN CUP
               Dr. Griswold...

     A moment of pathetic silence, then:

     Molly starts laughing -- He is destroyed.

                             TIN CUP
               The therapist laughs at her
               patient? Is that how it works? A
               man is laid bare before God and
               he's the butt of the cosmic joke?

                             MOLLY
               I'm sorry, I just...

                             TIN CUP
               Some of this shit might actually

                                                           84.
          work, y'know... I mean I think
          there's something to this hat
          with the pendulum golf ball
          thing... may be on to something
          here...

                        MOLLY
          Oh, Roy, Jesus... Quoting yourself,
          'It is the paraphernalia for lost
          and desperate souls.'

Tin Cup lets down. The wind goes out of his sails and he
loses his defensiveness.

                         TIN CUP
          Well, God damn... a lost and
          desperate soul stands before you.
                  (beat)
          I assume I have the
          confidentiality of doctor-client
          privilege in regards to this
          outfit?

                        MOLLY
          Of course you do. What happened?

                        TIN CUP
          I got the shanks.

                        MOLLY
          Are you taking penicillin?

                        TIN CUP
          It can't be treated! It's much
          worse than whatever you thought it
          was.
                 (beat)
          There's a glitch in my swing.

                        MOLLY
          So it's in Romeo's department?

                        TIN CUP
          He thinks it's your department --
          says it's a head thing.

                        MOLLY
          Oh. Well. I just came over to
          congratulate you on the regionals
          and return your car -- David says
          he doesn't want it, just wanted to
          make a point with you --
                 (beat)
          But I suppose we could have a
          therapy session right here and now
          --

                                                         85.
                        TIN CUP
          I don't want therapy. I want you.

                         MOLLY
          Roy...   I gotta get some air --

                        TIN CUP
          Look at me --
                 (considering what
                  that means)
          Well, not right at the moment --
          but listen to me. You're with the
          wrong guy. I'm the right guy.
          Everyone tells me my face is all
          screwed up tight as a drum 'cause
          I've been crazy about you from
          the day you showed up wearing
          this stupid stuff and the whole
          damn thing has both inspired
          me to get here on the verge of
          greatness yet it's also caused
          me to get the shanks which
          could humiliate me in front of
          a zillion people.
                 (beat)
          Such is life. So dump that phony
          bastard and come to the Open in my
          corner -- you can delay your
          romantic urges, which I know are
          lurking in there among the excess
          of brain cells you possess --
          until the appropriate time...
                 (beat)
          Tell me you're not at least
          moderately attracted to me.

Tin Cup stands there with the ball still dangling from
his hat, the leather straps, the bucket, the arrows --
for the moment he's forgotten how stupid he looks.

                        MOLLY
          You have moments.

                        TIN CUP
          Tell me which ones are my moments
          and I'll try to duplicate them.

                        MOLLY
          This is a moment. You look great.

                         TIN CUP
          Now?!

                        MOLLY
          Utterly exposed, completely
          vulnerable, the inner child trying
          to get out.

                                                               86.

                             TIN CUP
               My inner child needs spanking.

                             MOLLY
               You always liked that part about
               saddling up, the smell of leather
               --

                             TIN CUP
               C'mon, let's have a drink. Call
               it therapy. Charge me 75 an hour.
               Little Cuervo, little Freud...

     She's thinking about it.

                             MOLLY
               Naw... I gotta go.
                      (turns to leave)
               Oh, I don't have a car, I
               need a ride.

                                                    CUT TO:


83   EXT. ALONG RIVER BACK TO TOWN - DAY                       83

     Tin Cup and Molly in his convertible.   He works on her
     without pushing too hard.

                             TIN CUP
               I know a spot along the river's
               great to watch the sunset?

                                MOLLY
               Not tonight.

                             TIN CUP
               'Not tonight' means maybe some
               other night?

                             MOLLY
               I didn't mean it like that.

                             TIN CUP
               Consciously you didn't mean it
               like that -- but how about
               unconsciously, you're the expert,
               did you mean it unconsciously?

                             MOLLY
               Unconsciously, Roy, I don't have a
               clue what I'm talking about.

                             TIN CUP
               I feel we're making progress.

                                                                   87.
                                MOLLY
                  I do too. But I have no idea what
                  it's progress towards...


A84     EXT. MOLLY'S OFFICE - DUSK                                 A84

        The Caddy pulls up in front of her office at the new
        mall. She gets out.

                                MOLLY
                  Good luck in the Open, Roy.

                                 TIN CUP
                  Put your money on me, Doc, the
                  odds are fabulous and God knows
                  I'm overdue...

        He drives away, and we stay:


        CLOSE ON MOLLY

        Watching Tin Cup careen away in his Caddy.

                                                         CUT TO:


84/85   EXT. SOUTHWESTERN HIGHWAY - DAY                            84/85

        The intrepid Winnebago on the way to the Open.    Romeo
        drives -- Tin Cup stares out the window.

                                ROMEO
                  You got to relax, boss --

                                TIN CUP
                  Goin' to the U.S. Open with the
                  shanks. Gonna be chili dipping my
                  way around the course on worldwide
                  television... sure, relax.

                                ROMEO
                  I'm gonna get rid of them shanks
                  for ya. No hay problema.

                                TIN CUP
                  Molly and I are circling each
                  other... I can feel it...

                                ROMEO
                  She the enemy, boss.

                                TIN CUP
                  Naw...

                                                                   88.
                              ROMEO
               Well she wakin' up with the enemy
               -- same thing.

                             TIN CUP
               Tell me something, Romes -- the
               absolute truth -- you think I can
               go 72 holes without falling apart.

     Romeo keeps driving, pretends not to hear.

                             TIN CUP
               You heard me! I don't want no
               bullshit... do you think I can do
               it?

                             ROMEO
               I don't know, boss, I just don't
               know.

     And Tin Cup puts on his Walkman, and stares out the
     window endlessly at a thousand miles of passing scenery,
     to the MUSIC of GEORGE JONES...

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:


86   EXT. DESERT - DAY                                             86

     The WINNEBAGO RUMBLES out of the country heading east,
     and --

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:
                                                            94.

87   EXT. CENTRAL TEXAS PLAINS - DAY                               87

     The Winnebago heads out of the high plains.

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:


89   EXT. PINE HILLS GOLF CLUB (NORTH CAROLINA) - DAY              89

     The Winnebago passes through a "tunnel" of tall, old
     pines into a cathedral environment of old money and
     old golf.


90   INT. WINNEBAGO - DAY                                          90

     Romeo and Tin Cup stare out into the trees, the lushness
     -- a couple of wide-eyed kids.

                             TIN CUP
               I bet this is the first Winnebago
               they ever saw here...

                                                            89.

                        ROMEO
          Yeah... and the first Mexican...

The Winnebago pulls up to a guard gate -- A SECURITY
GUARD comes to the window. A banner hangs above the
entrance a few paces past the security gate, proclaiming:
"Old Pines -- U.S. Open Championship."

                        SECURITY GUARD
          Yes?

                        ROMEO
          Como esta, amigo. I have with me
          one of the legendary ball strikers
          in the history of golf --

The Security Guard strains to see in.

                        SECURITY GUARD
          Who's that? Mr. Crenshaw? That you?
          Mr. Price, Mr. Norman? No?

Tin Cup leans across Romeo to introduce himself.

                        TIN CUP
          Roy 'Tin Cup' McAvoy.
          Representing the great American
          Southwest.

The Guard backs off quickly, turns to his SECOND.

                        SECURITY GUARD
          Do we have a... McCormack... on
          the list.

                        ROMEO
          McAvoy -- Roy McAvoy -- he's a
          legend!

                        SECURITY GUARD
          We got over 150 legends in this
          tournament. Sorry.

Romeo starts cursing in Spanish.   The Guard is unphased.

                        SECURITY GUARD
          Call the police.

                        ROMEO
          Police?

The police quickly appear to take over the situation.
Tin Cup leaps out of the Winnebago to argue his point.

                        TIN CUP
          There's a mistake here, fellas!

                                                           90.

A COP grabs Tin Cup and Roy is ready to fight.   It's
getting ugly real fast.

                        COP
          We'll throw your ass in jail right
          now, pal -- there's a lotta
          lunatics here and we don't take
          chances...

At that moment David Simms pulls in, driving a con-
vertible sponsor's car. He sees the scuffle, gets
out.

                        SIMMS
          What's the problem here?

                        SECURITY GUARD
          This clown says he's in the
          Open...

Simms spots Tin Cup -- a delicious moment for him. Tin
Cup wants to hide but he just gamely covers his face.

                        TIN CUP
          Hiya, David... nice sweater.

                        SECURITY GUARD
          He's not on the list.

Simms takes the clipboard with the list.

                        SIMMS
          Hiya, Roy... welcome to the big
          leagues...
                 (checks the list)
          Here ya go, Charlie, his name's
          right here.
                 (to Tin Cup)
          They spelled your name wrong --
          easy mistake with a total unknown.

                        SECURITY GUARD
                 (to Cop)
          Let him in.

Simms smiles at Tin Cup, the easy smile of a man on top.

Tin Cup doesn't respond, just asks the Guard:

                        TIN CUP
          Which way to the practice range?

As Tin Cup tries to regain some dignity, and climbs back
into the Winnebago --

                                                                 91.
                             SECURITY GUARD
                      (to Simms)
               He said he was a 'legend'?

                             SIMMS
               Oh he is... he's a very big name
               at a driving range in Salome,
               Texas...

     They all have a good laugh, and --

                                                    CUT TO:


91   EXT. PRACTICE RANGE - DAY                                   91

     Lots of the big names are there.   Romeo is like a kid at
     the ballpark.

                             ROMEO
               Look! Right there! Fred
               Couples... and Ray Floyd!

     Romeo notices that Tin Cup is staring at the pile of
     practice balls lying there on the tee.

                             TIN CUP
               Look at these balls. Brand new
               Titleists. Lookit 'em, every one
               a brand new Titleist.
                      (lowers his voice)
               Sneak a few in the bag when you
               get a chance. We swipe enough
               free shit we might even pay for
               this fiasco.

     Tin Cup limbers up, trying not to be in awe of the real
     legends who line the practice range, hitting beautiful
     shot after beautiful shot with graceful ease.

                             ROMEO
               You think it would be
               inappropriate to ask Ray Floyd for
               an autograph?

                             TIN CUP
               I think it's a dead giveaway,
               Romes... but if I still got the
               shanks we're gonna be found out
               real fast...

     Tin Cup nudges a ball from the pile into address
     position. Romeo hands him a different club.

                             ROMEO
               Hit the seven iron. You never
               miss the seven...

                                                            92.

                         TIN CUP
           Good thought, Pods...

Tin Cup waggles, shakes, limbers, addresses...

                         TIN CUP
           Dollar bills...

And he swings.

THWOCK! A hideous shank squirrels across line, almost
hitting a group of U.S. Open officials. Heads turn.

                         TIN CUP
                  (to anyone who'll
                   listen)
           Who hit that shot? Anybody see?

He addresses another one.   And swings.

THWOCK!   A disaster.   He crumbles.

                         ROMEO
           A little thin, Boss.

                         TIN CUP
           A little fucking thin?! I still
           got the shanks! Everybody's
           watching! Christ, Simms is here...

Simms has arrived and is watching Tin Cup with delight as
he loosens up.

                         ROMEO
           Maybe we should work on putting.
           Ya can't shank a putt.

Tin Cup pretends to limber a little more before daring to
strike another ball.

                         TIN CUP
           If you're the Mexican Mac O'Grady,
           Romes, you gotta figure out why
           I'm still shanking the ball.
                  (beat)
           What's the problem? I'm catching
           it on the hosel, right? Moving my
           head? I'm laying off it, I'm
           pronating, I'm supinating, I'm
           clearing too early, I'm clearing
           too late, I'm off plane, I ain't
           dropping in -- oh, God, my swing
           feels like an unfolding lawn chair.

                         ROMEO
           You got a virus in your brain.   I

          got to kill the brain to kill the
          virus.

                         TIN CUP
          Anything.   Kill me now!

                        ROMEO
          Put all your change in your right
          pocket.

Tin Cup follows orders, not questioning the logic.

                        ROMEO
          Very good. Now tie your left
          shoelace in a double knot.

Again, Tin Cup dutifully follows orders.

                        ROMEO
          Esta bueno. Now, turn your hat
          around backwards and put a blue
          tee behind your right ear...

                        TIN CUP
          I'll look like a fool.

                        ROMEO
          What you think you look like
          hitting those squirrelly chili
          peppers up Freddy Couples' ass,
          eh? Do what I say or I quit.

          Okay, okay...

                        ROMEO
          Perfect... now hit a seven iron
          into that tree over there. You're
          ready.

Tin Cup hits a perfect seven iron into the trees.

                        TIN CUP
          How'd I do that?

                         ROMEO
          You ain't thinking about shanking,
          you ain't thinking about the
          doctor lady, you ain't thinking
          period. You just lookin' like a
          fool and hittin' it pure -- your
          natural state.

                          TIN CUP
          Fuck you.

                                                                94.
                             ROMEO
               You cured.

                             TIN CUP
               That's it?

                            ROMEO
               That's it. Your brain was getting
               in the way.

                             TIN CUP
               That's rarely been a problem.
               What now?

                              ROMEO
               Well, I should recommend you go
               work on your short game but I
               think it's better if you go get
               drunk instead.

                             TIN CUP
               Get drunk?

                              ROMEO
               Yeah. You always play better when
               you're wasted.

     Tin Cups stares at the swami, and --

                                                    CUT TO:


92   INT. WINNEBAGO (IN PARKING LOT) - NIGHT                    92

     Again to GEORGE JONES on the CASSETTE PLAYER, Tin Cup is
     doing a slow dance with his driver.

     Romeo sits on the couch, stone cold sober, pouring drink
     after drink for Tin Cup, who's thoroughly plastered.

                             TIN CUP
               It's three in the morning, Romes,
               what time I tee off?

                             ROMEO
               Seven-o-five... first group off...
               Keep drinking, keep dancing...

                             TIN CUP
               That's four hours from now?

                             ROMEO
               You're drinking till five...
               c'mon, c'mon, have another --
                      (a tough coach)
               Get you in shape --

                                                                   95.
      Tin Cup tosses down yet another drink, and staggers
      around the room with his driver until, finally, he
      collapses in a heap on the floor. Romeo looks down
      at him coolly, like horse trainer Wayne Lukas sizing
      up his Derby entry.

                              ROMEO
                Nothing like the sight of a
                finely-tuned athlete on the verge
                of greatness...

      Romeo tosses a blanket over Tin Cup lying on the floor.

                                                    CUT TO:


A93   EXT. PINE HILLS CLUBHOUSE - EARLY MORNING                    A93

      Two figures hurry across the lawn to the first tee.    Our
      intrepid Don Quixote and Sancho Panza.


93    EXT. GOLF COURSE - EARLY MORNING                             93

      The first tee -- the early morning air is heavy and
      still. The course is quiet and wet with dew. The
      gallery is sparse. The silence is broken by the
      starter's voice.

                              STARTER (V.O.)
                With the honor in the 7:08
                pairing, from Salome, Texas,
                Mr. Roy McAvoy.

      A half-dozen people clap, and --

      Tin Cup and Romeo stagger to the tee, barely making it on
      time. Tin Cup is massively hung-over and unshaven.

                              TIN CUP
                No time for a bucket, eh?

                              ROMEO
                Almost missed the starting time
                trying to get you off the floor,
                boss. You don't handle the hooch
                like you used to...

      Tin Cup tries to get warm quickly, taking a few hurried
      practice swings. The early tee times are strictly for
      the longest of long shots, and almost nobody is around.
      Tin Cup's hand shakes as he closes the Velcro flap on his
      glove. He's wearing the hat and shirt with the sew-on
      patches, as he stares down the first fairway.

      Romeo hands him a driver.

                                                                   96.
                             ROMEO
               I seen this hole on TV. Hit the
               big dog down the chute --

                             TIN CUP
               No, I've learned my lesson. Gonna
               play it safe, smart, conservative.
               Fairways and greens. Hand me the
               two iron.

                               ROMEO
               You sure?

                             TIN CUP
               Thought of the day is -- `be
               humble.'

     And Tin Cup launches a two iron down the first fairway.

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:


94   EXT. SCOREBOARD - DAY (LATER)                                 94

     The scorer posts an eighty-three next to Tin Cup's name.

     Tin Cup stares, shell-shocked, as his score is posted.

                               ROMEO
               Eighty-three.    Well, you humble
               now.

                             TIN CUP
               Eleven bogeys and seven pars. I
               didn't make a three. I didn't
               make one goddam three all day.

                             ROMEO
               You weren't trying to make threes.
               You were trying to avoid making
               thirteen.

                             TIN CUP
               I was hungover!

                             ROMEO
               Maybe that was a coaching error on
               my part.

                             TIN CUP
               Thanks, amigo...

     David Simms is interviewed.

                      (on the television)
               I'm the last person who expected
               me to come out of the blocks with
               a sixty-seven and lead the Open...
               It's been a long time since I
               played this game with the fire and
               determination you need to win...

                             TIN CUP
               The Anti-Christ shoots 67, you
               believe it?

                             ROMEO
               Ol' Anti-Christ got a hot
               putter...

                             SIMMS (V.O.)
                      (on television)
               ... you see, this game is all
               about integrity and tradition and
               honor...

                             TIN CUP
               What? It's about cheating and
               racism and bullshit!

                               ROMEO
               Easy, boss...

96   EXT. JUST OFF EIGHTEENTH - DAY (SAME TIME)               96

     Live coverage of the Simms interview. Molly is among a
     small crowd gathered to watch. He doesn't seem to know
     that she's there.

                             SIMMS
                      (live on mike)
               So tomorrow I'll just go out there
               and try to make some good swings
               and, Lord willing, maybe I can put
               up another good number. Thank
               you.

                             NANTZ
               Thank you, David Simms, a
               brilliant opening round 67 to take
               the lead.

     Simms walks away, now off-camera.   FANS call out --

                                                                  98.

                                 SIMMS
               Gotta go.

     Simms cuts down behind the tent toward the clubhouse,
     away from the galleries. The marshals open a rope
     allowing him to avoid the crowds, but --

     An ELDERLY COUPLE with a young child are there.   The lady
     has a tiny dog in her arms.

                             OLD MAN
               Excuse me, Mr. Simms!
                      (off no response)
               Can you sign an autograph for our
               grandson?

                              SIMMS
                      (snaps)
               Can't you see I'm busy?! I'm
               working! This is my office! Do I
               come to your office and ask you
               for an autograph?! Jesus...

     He practically stiff-arms them as he passes, heading up
     to the clubhouse. They stand there in shock.

                             SIMMS
                      (muttering to
                       himself)
               Who the fuck these people think
               they are...

     CAMERA PANS OVER TO the edge of the tent. Molly, trying
     to get to David, has seen the whole thing.

     Simms enters to numerous congratulations from officials,
     caddies, other PLAYERS. Instantly, in public, he feigns
     humility with convincing flair.

                             PLAYER #1
               Helluva round, Dave!

                           PLAYER #2
             Great start, Simmsy...

Simms stops when he sees Tin Cup and Romeo drowning their
sorrows.

                           SIMMS
             Hey, Tin Cup -- heard you put a
             monster number up there...

                           TIN CUP
             Coulda been worse...

A small bar crowd is enjoying Simms' taunts.

                           SIMMS
             I played in the Pro-Am with some
             asshole movie star shot 82 here
             once... how did a great ball-
             striker like you, a `legend,'
             manage to shoot an 83?

                           TIN CUP
             I missed a four foot putt on the
             eighteen for an 82, that's how...

                           SIMMS
             It ain't like playing some muni
             track in Brownsville, is it?

A voice interrupts.

                           MOLLY
             Does, `integrity, tradition, and
             honor' include kicking a man when
             he's down?

                           SIMMS
             Oh, Mol', this is just guy stuff,
             bar talk, part of the game -- no
             offense, right, Cup?

No answer.    Tin Cup's about as low as one can go.

                           MOLLY
                    (defensively)
             This man still has a lot of good
             golf shots in his system --

                           TIN CUP
                    (trying to hide)
             Molly, it's okay, go away... I
             don't need any attention right

                                                           100.
          now...

                        SOME GUY AT THE BAR
                 (to Tin Cup)
          You the guy shot 83?!

                        MOLLY
          David, I'll bet you a hundred
          dollars right now that Roy here
          can hit a ball --
                 (looks around)
          -- from right here to... through
          that door to the patio...

She points to a double door, forty feet away across, the
bar, about an 8 x 8 foot opening.

                        TIN CUP
          Molly, please...

                        MOLLY
                 (to bartender)
          And give me a vodka tonic with a
          twist --

                        SIMMS
          Molly, really, this isn't...
          dignified...

                        MOLLY
          Roy?

                        TIN CUP
          I wanta go back to Texas...

                        MOLLY
          What about the river, the piranha,
          the immortality? All that
          bullshit? You gonna drag your ass
          home with an 83?
                 (looks around)
          In fact, two hundred says he can
          hit it through that door, over the
          patio, into the river, and make
          that pelican fly off that post.

Everyone strains to look --

A pelican sits on a piling in the river.   Impossible.

                        SIMMS
          This is ridiculous...

But Romeo's sizing it up.

                        ROMEO
          You got that shot, Pods, hood the
          seven, turn it over, start it low,
          right to left...

Molly takes a swig of her drink and slaps some money on
the bar.

                        MOLLY
          I'm not leaving till one of you
          men starts acting in a manly
          fashion.

Simms puts a hundred dollar bill on the counter.

                        SIMMS
          Let's just get this over with.
          One ball, one swing, one gull.

                         MOLLY
          Roy?

Tin Cup still sits, head half buried at the bar. He's
never passed up such an opportunity, but he's pretty low.

                         ROMEO
          You the man.

He turns from his bar stool, glances at the situation.

          One swing?   Four to one odds.

                        SIMMS
          I'll make it ten to one. Stick it
          up your ass. I'm leading the
          Open.

                        MOLLY
          Now we're talking! Manly men!

Whoas! From the barside gallery. Tin Cup rises and
someone hands him a club. Suddenly there's a crowd,
including Gary McCord who's been watching from the far
end of the bar. He grabs a seltzer hose as if it's a
mike and begins announcing.

                        McCORD
          ... He's looking at thirty yards
          of bar and grill, an opening
          through the French doors, forty
          yards of patio umbrellas, a

                                                                102.
               hundred yards of water, and a
               lonely pelican sitting out there
               in a 15 mile an hour breeze, south
               by southwest...
                      (beat)
               He'll probably try to shut down a
               four iron -- no, he's selected his
               trusty seven iron...

     Tin Cup steps up to a ball lying on the carpet.

                             TIN CUP
               Kind of a thin lie...

                             SIMMS
               Beats all that deep rough you were
               in today...

                             ROMEO
               Fore in the grill! Fore on the
               patio! You're the legend, boss...

     Tin Cup suddenly backs off the swing and turns to Molly.

                             TIN CUP
               What is this all about?

                             MOLLY
               Shut up and hit the ball.

                             McCORD
                      (on "mike")
               The Ledge still has to be thinking
               about that brutal, ego-sapping,
               manhood-robbing eighty-three he
               buried himself under yesterday. I
               mean, that's just an avalanche of
               golf swings, a landslide, a
               pyroclastic flow --

                             TIN CUP
               Dollar bills...


98   And he swings -- the ball rockets through the hall and     98
     clears the open door...

     The bettors pile from the bar and grill and race to the
     patio to watch the flight of the ball, as --

     It's carrying, it's hooking, it's carrying, then:

     THWACK! -- It hits the piling!    The SEAGULL lifts off,
     SCREECHING angrily.

                             ROMEO
               Stiff, baby, stiff!

                                                                  103.


99    A whoop goes up -- And Simms storms out.                    99

                              SIMMS
                I'm outta here. You're all nuts.

                              MOLLY
                I musta been blind thinking you
                were worth a shit, Simmsy!
                       (raucously)
                Drinks on me, boys! Helluva shot,
                Roy!

                              TIN CUP
                Actually I thinned it a little or
                that pelican'd be flying around
                with a Titleist up his ass...

      This is the old Tin Cup -- and he's in the clubhouse with
      an eightyfuckingthree.

      down on the club and the beat-up RV.

      Romeo stands outside with an umbrella, dragging on a

      Tin Cup and Molly in bed, lit only by light spilling in
      from a parking lamp. They make love with enthusiasm,
      finally wobbling to a stop.

      Silence, except for the rain.   Until:

                              TIN CUP
                I kinda shanked it, eh?

                Yeah... well, as Walter Hagen once
                said -- 'Sex and golf are the only
                two things you can be bad at and
                still enjoy...'

                The sun is struggling to come out,
                the course is drying up, and in
                case you're just joining us, the

                -- David Simms is clinging to a
                one shot lead over Peter Jacobsen...
                but the real story is out on
                sixteen where a driving range pro
                who shot an opening eighty-three
                is making a run at perhaps the
                most legendary round of golf in
                Open history, Johnny Miller's
                sixty-three at Oakmont -- Ben
                Wright is in the tower at

105    EXT. SIXTEENTH HOLE - DAY                                   105

       We hear Ben Wright's voice as Tin Cup marks his ball on
       the green. A small gallery has begun to follow him.

                               WRIGHT (V.O.)
                 If anyone was ever to make a run
                 at what is the most storied number
                 in Open history, Miller's sixty-
                 three, it would be today when the
                 rain has softened the greens,
                 enabling the players to take dead
                 aim at the flags. Still, the
                 unswerving courage of an unknown
                 driving range pro from Salome has
                 raised that humble journeyman from
                 the ashes of an ignominious
                 eighty-three to wave a mighty fist
                 at the pantheon of golf's
                 immortals. This man, this Roy
                 McAvoy has laid siege to the
                 record book by birdieing the first
                 seven holes. A brave par from the
                 water at eight, and a glorious
                 birdie three at the daunting
                 twelfth, another at thirteen...

       Tin Cup gets his read, and steps up to putt.

                               WRIGHT (V.O.)
                 ... this putt to go ten under for
                 the day...

       Tin Cup putts -- When the ball is still two feet from the
       hole, Tin Cup raises his putter in triumph... and sure
       enough, the ball drops in the hole.

       Tin Cup knocks his approach to within six feet of the
       cup. The swelling gallery at the green roars.

                They said on the radio he was ten
                under --

                              EVERYONE
                Shhhh!!!

      Silence, everyone watching the TV, everyone starting to
      contort in body-English, then:

      A joyous roar -- Tin Cup's putt went down.    Earl twirls
      with glee.

                              EARL
                He's shooting the lowest round
                ever!

                              CLINT
                And eighteen's a par five. A
                birdie there, he shoots sixty!

                              DOREEN
                We gotta go, boys. We gotta get
                us on a Continental Trailways and
                find this damn place!

      The MONITOR shows Tin Cup approaching his ball in the
      fairway. Ken Venturi is commentating.

                              VENTURI
                McAvoy's hit another big drive,
                but this is not a shot he wants to
                get aggressive with...


109   EXT. EIGHTEENTH FAIRWAY - DAY                               109

      Tin Cup and Romeo survey the shot -- a long downhill
      carry over a lake to a slightly elevated green. A shot
      similar to the one he pulled off at the best-ball.

                              ROMEO
                Two-sixty to carry, Roy. You got
                to lay up, man. I don't care how
                good you swinging. You got to lay

                                                                    107.
                up.

      Tin Cup looks at the iron Romeo proffers. He looks back
      at the shot, throws some grass in the air, testing the
      wind. He looks at the gallery, the lake, the green, the
      whole grand setting... and then:

      He locates Molly behind the gallery ropes, watching.    She
      makes a little charging gesture with her fist. And:

      Tin Cup reaches defiantly past Romeo and pulls out the
      three wood.


110   EXT. TELEVISION TOWER - DAY                                   110

      Venturi and Nantz watch Tin Cup set up to play the shot.

                              VENTURI
                His adrenalin's gotten the better
                of him, Jim. If he lays up he
                takes bogey out of play.

                              VENTURI (CONT'D)
                But if he knocks this ball in the
                water he could make seven or eight.
                And he still has to think about
                making the cut.

                              SUMMERALL
                Well, every golf fan in America is
                pulling for him.


111   Wearing that look, the look of eagles, Tin Cup addresses 111
      his ball... And he swings -- The ball arches off his
      club, the gallery roars, and...

                                TIN CUP
                Nope.

      ... Tin Cup drops the three wood on his bag, even as:

                                ROMEO
                Carry, honey!    Please!   Carry!


      LAKE

      The ball plunks in the water inches short of dry land.
      The GALLERY GROANS.


      BACK UP FAIRWAY

      Tin Cup smiles at Molly with chagrin but not defeat.    He
      turns to Romeo.

                                                                   108.

                              TIN CUP
                What the hell. You ride 'er till
                she bucks you or you don't ride at
                all. I can save par from here.

      Tin Cup hits a wedge to within five feet.

                Up an' down...

      Tin Cup approaches his ball in the middle of the fairway.
      The fans holler "You da man" at Tin Cup.

116   INT. TELEVISION TOWER - DAY                                 116

      Nantz and Venturi in the booth. Tin Cup is on the
      monitor, arriving at his ball. We hear SHOUTS from the
      GALLERY, encouraging him to go for the green.

                               VENTURI
                It's the same shot he knocked in
                the water yesterday. And the
                thing for him to do right now is
                to tune out the gallery, rein in
                his emotions, and forget what he
                said in yesterday's interview. He
                has to lay up.


117   EXT. EIGHTEENTH FAIRWAY - DAY                               117

      Romeo palms the seven iron, waiting for Tin Cup to decide
      on his play.

                              TIN CUP
                Gimme the three wood.

      Romeo picks up some grass and flips it in the air.   It
      blows away from the green.

                              ROMEO
                There's wind up there.

                              TIN CUP
                I know.


118   INT. TELEVISION TOWER - DAY                                 118

      The announcers see Tin Cup taking out the three wood.

                              NANTZ
                Well, he hasn't shown an ounce of
                fear all day.

                              VENTURI
                This isn't courage, Jim. This is
                inexperience, pure and simple.


119   EXT. EIGHTEENTH FAIRWAY - DAY                               119

                                                                 110.
      Tin Cup steps up to his shot.

                              TIN CUP
                This is for Venturi, up there in
                the booth, thinking I should lay
                up...
                       (addressing his ball)
                Dollar bills...

      He swings and holds the pose. He caught the ball
      perfectly -- it sails high and true into the luffing
      breeze, the GALLERY ROARS, and...

      ... the ball drops, SPLOOSH! into the WATER, a couple
      feet short of dry land. The GALLERY GROANS.`


      BACK TO TIN CUP

      Staring amazed, almost betrayed, that his ball didn't
      carry the water.

                              TIN CUP
                That's a long fucking ways.
                       (holds out his hand)
                Gimme another ball.

                                ROMEO
                Roy...

                                TIN CUP
                What?

                              ROMEO
                It's a water hazard. You go up
                there and take a drop. Try to
                save par like you did yesterday.

      Tin Cup's eyes blink with thought as Romeo's words get
      through to him.

                                TIN CUP
                You're right.    What the hell was I
                thinking?

      And he starts down to the water. A THUNDEROUS OVATION
      greets his approach, and he raises his hat to salute the
      fans saluting him.

                                                       CUT TO:


120   INT. PRESS TENT - AFTERNOON                                120

      Tin Cup snarls at the impudent question of Reporter #3.

                                                               111.
                              TIN CUP
                I saved par, didn't I?

                              REPORTER #3
                I'm just trying to understand your
                thinking. You were in the same
                spot on eighteen yesterday without
                a headwind and you --

                              TIN CUP
                You don't think I can knock it on
                from there?

                              REPORTER #3
                It seemed like a low-percentage
                shot.

                              TIN CUP
                So am I! Look at me. I'm playing
                for...

                to think about the percentages? --

                I've got some money from the
                pelican bet -- why don't we go
                somewhere fancy and celebrate --
                get ready for the final round.

                              TIN CUP
                Nothing to celebrate yet. Plus
                these are my people. I'm a waffle
                house guy -- gotta stay in touch
                with that...

                              ROMEO
                Plus he needs his carbohydrates --

          If the boys from Salome was in

The boys from Salome walk in -- with Doreen, all looking
like hell from the long bus trip. They're ecstatic to
see Tin Cup and Romeo.

          You boys a sight for sore eyes.
          We so damn sick of guys in blazers
          and slacks that don't wrinkle. It
          ain't natural 'round here...

          can't be his therapist.

                          DOREEN
          I knew it.

                          MOLLY
          Knew what?

                        DOREEN
          Nothing, dear. Good luck.
                 (looking around)
          Say, I have a little extra cash --
          why don't we go somewhere fancy
          and celebrate -- y'know, kinda get

                                                                 113.
                ready for the final round?

      But the Regulars overwhelm her.

                              DEWEY
                This is the Waffle House, Doreen --

                              CURT
                Hell, I been dreaming of waffles
                for 1800 miles...

                              EARL
                They got a waffle house in Odessa
                just about like this...

                               JOSE
                Odessa?   It's in Midland, ain't it?...

                              CLINT
                No, it's in Odessa.

      They all pull up chairs and settle in for a long evening
      at the Waffle House.

      Tin Cup leans back in his chair, turns to Molly.

                              TIN CUP
                It just don't get much better than
                this...

                You the man, Cup, you the man...

      Romeo leans over to Doreen amidst the chaos and speaks
      with suave elegance.

                               ROMEO
                You're looking particularly lovely
                this evening... the coif is
                extraordinary.

                Why thank you... Romeo.

      Her face close to Tin Cup's.    Both awake.

                  Yeah, I'm nervous. So's everybody
                  else. But I only gotta come and
                  catch Simms. Sixty-seven guys

       Silence.   Except for the random snore.

       She puts her finger over his mouth gently.

                               EARL
                 Vegas has him at ten to one. They're
                 sure he's gonna self-destruct.

                               MOLLY
                 Those sound good to me -- I want
                 you to place a bet for me. Five
                 thousand nine hundred dollars on
                 Tin Cup to win.

      They stare nervously.

                               CURT

                 That's a bad idea, honey -- we
                 love him, but he's gonna fuck-
                 up --

                               MOLLY
                 I said put it all on Roy.    Got

                               MOLLY
                 Put it all on Tin Cup.

      Tin Cup hits putts, intense, focused.    Peter Jacobsen
      works his way over to Tin Cup.

                               JACOBSEN
                 Looking a little tight, Ledge.

                               TIN CUP
                 Musta got too much sleep last
                 night. How you choking?

                                                                 116.
                              JACOBSEN
                Just got one thought in my head.
                Ten under. That's my number.

      Tin Cup looks up, amused by the gamesmanship.

                              TIN CUP
                No one's ever been ten under for
                the Open, not even Nicklaus.

                              JACOBSEN
                That's right, Ledge. Not even
                Nicklaus.

      And he moves off to putt. Tin Cup drops a couple balls
      on the green to putt, and:

      A ball rolls past them and into a hole.   Tin Cup looks
      over and sees Simms.

                              SIMMS
                Sorry, Roy, can't believe I didn't
                see you with all that high-priced
                endorsement crap you're flaunting.

                That's always been your problem,
                Dave. You don't think about
                winning; you just want to look
                good.
                       (turns away
                         to putt)
                Thing is, this ain't a beauty
                pageant.
                       (turns back, getting
                         in Simms' face)
                And it ain't a rain-shortened Quad
                Cities or a Greater Greensboro you
                can back into. This is you'n me,
                pal. This is match-play, and this
                time you ain't getting no three
                shots.

125   EXT. FIRST TEE - HIGH ANGLE - DAY                          125

      A large gallery surrounds the tree and lines the fairway
      as:

                              STARTER
                With the honor in the final
                pairing, from Salome, Texas, Mr.
                Roy McAvoy.

      Boisterous applause.   Tin Cup tips his cap and nods at

                                                                   117.
      David Simms, his pairing in this the final twosome of the
      final round of the U.S. Open.

                              TIN CUP
                Fairways and greens, Dave... and
                don't forget to wave as I blow by.

                              SIMMS
                You mean blow up? Like you always
                do?

      And Tin Cup moves to the tee.

      His hand shakes worse than it did the first day as he
      tees his ball. Stepping back to line up his shot, he
      peers down the fairway through a narrow corridor of
      faces. A daunting sight. He edges over to Romeo and
      tautly whispers:

                              TIN CUP
                Do me a favor. Bet me a buck I
                don't put it in the fairway.

                              ROMEO
                I bet you a hundred.

                              TIN CUP
                Okay, good.
                       (going to tee off)
                Puts things back in perspective.

126   EXT. FIRST HOLE - MINUTE LATER                               126

      Tin Cup looks at his ball, almost invisible in the deep
      rough. He tries to locate the green beyond the trees
      that surround him. In golf parlance, he's in jail. He
      selects a club.

                              ROMEO
                Which way you going?

      Tin Cup points over the trees.   Romeo grimaces.   Tin Cup
      addresses the shot. Then:

      Tin Cup swings -- the ball flutters weakly out of the
      rough and disappears into the branches of a bushy tree,
      dropping eventually next to its trunk, and:

                                                     CUT TO:

                               SIMMS
                 Nice double, Roy.

                               TIN CUP
                 Just keep making pars, asshole.

                               SIMMS

129   EXT. THIRD GREEN - DAY                                      129

      Molly and Doreen stand together behind the big gallery.
      Molly is using a cardboard periscope to look over the
      gallery to the green. Doreen is on her tip-toes but all
      she can see are the backs of heads.

      A swell of cheers builds, then turns to groans.

                               MOLLY
                 Oh no, Tin Cup ran it five feet
                 past.
                        (beat)
                 How did he get the name 'Tin Cup'?

                               DOREEN (O.S.)
                 He played catcher on the high
                 school baseball team. The star
                 pitcher had this big-league curve,
                 and not all his pitches hit Roy
                 in the mitt. Finally, you gotta
                 respect a man's doggedness. You
                 know?
                        (beat)
                 The team decided Tin Cup sounded
                 better than Clank.

      Molly puts down the periscope at that remark, and hands
      it to Doreen.

                               MOLLY
                 'Clank''s not a good name for a
                 man...

                                                                 119.

      Doreen looks through the periscope.

      The regulars study the board -- the scruffiest lot ever
      seen at an Open. Next to them stand a group of U.S.G.A.
      officials, all in neat, matching blazers. The contrast
      is thrilling.

                              CLINT
                Our boy's in trouble... ya think

      Wright looks at the monitor where Tin Cup stands among
      some trees.

                              BEN WRIGHT
                This is disaster for McAvoy.
                After losing three shots to par in
                the first four holes, he should
                have just taken iron off the tee
                to get the ball in play. Does he
                have any shot at all, Gary McCord?


132   EXT. FIFTH HOLE - DAY                                      132

      Tin Cup's ball lies on dirt next to the trunk of a tree.
      He surveys his options. Behind him, wearing a headset,
      McCord analyzes the situation for the TV viewers.

                                                                  120.
                              McCORD
                This is definite jail. This is
                life without parole. His only
                chance to stage a jail-break is go
                at the ball left-handed and hope
                he can somehow snake it back into
                the fairway, and save par from
                there.

      Tin Cup glares balefully back at McCord. Then he walks
      over to a nearby tree, and surveys the line to the green
      from it. He walks back for his ball, turns to McCord...
      and we see that familiar fierceness aflame in Tin Cup's
      eyes.

                              TIN CUP
                Fifty bucks says I knock it on...
                with a seven iron.

      And he selects the seven iron, addresses the ball right- handed,
      and:

      He swings -- the ball rockets low off his club, and...

      ... it ricochets off the trunk of a nearby tree, and...

      ... it bounces up the fairway, skitters past a trap, and
      trickles onto the green, stopping ten feet from the pin.

      The gallery goes crazy as Tin Cup steps from the woods
      collecting his money from McCord while jabbing a taunting
      finger at Simms.

      The ball lands near the front of the green, bounces, then
      rolls, following the contour of the green. It finally

      A SWELLING, DEAFENING ROAR from the GALLERY accompanies
      the unfolding shot, and --

                We gotta make birdies, Squeaky, or

                              TIN CUP
                Jacobsen's laying up.
                       (turning to Simms)
                You ain't gonna have that luxury,
                Dave. Not if you play to win.

      He moves to the tee, and...

                                                       CUT TO:

                                                                  124.
149   EXT. TELEVISION TOWER                                       149

      The monitor shows Tin Cup's drive bounding down the
      middle of the fairway.

                              NANTZ
                McAvoy's hit a perfect drive, Ken.

                              VENTURI
                I'm not sure that's good news for
                McAvoy. With his inexperience,
                the last thing he needs is an
                excuse to fool with that water
                again today.


150   BACK TO TEE                                                 150

      Tin Cup whispers to Romeo as Simms tees up.

                              TIN CUP
                I didn't catch it all.

                              ROMEO
                Then you got to lay up.

      Simms rips a drive down the middle, the ball landing
      a little short of Roy's.


151   EXT. EIGHTEENTH FAIRWAY - DAY                               151

      Tin Cup in the fairway, studying his shot.

                              TIN CUP
                So birdie wins it.

      He looks at Simms, ten yards across the fairway from him.

                              TIN CUP
                You or me, Dave?

      Simms points to himself. He has a wood in his hands, but
      he puts the club back and reaches for an iron. Tin Cup
      edges closer to Romeo.

                              TIN CUP
                       (whispering)
                He's laying up. Birdie to tie,
                eagle to win, and that gutless
                wonder's laying up.

                              ROMEO
                       (whispering)
                Par to tie, birdie to win... you
                lay up too, Roy. You can make
                birdie laying up.

                                                           125.

They watch Simms lay up. Then Romeo offers Tin Cup an
iron, hoping he'll take it.

                         TIN CUP
          You know something, Romeo? Eagle
          puts me ten under. No one's ever
          finished an Open ten under, not
          even Nicklaus.

                         ROMEO
          You don't need an eagle. Birdie
          wins, par ties.
                 (firmly)
          Hit the lay up. Hole a wedge for
          goddamn eagle.

Tin Cup throws some grass in the air, looks back at the
green, the gallery, the whole grand setting... and he
seeks out Molly's face in the crowd. He moves over so
she can hear him.

                        TIN CUP
          This is everything, ain't it?
          This is the choice it comes down
          to. This is our immortality...

                        ROMEO
          No time to be thinkin'
          'immortality,' Cup... time to be
          thinkin' 7 iron.

Molly stands with Doreen, hearing Tin Cup's words.
Thrilled and terrified and spellbound, she finds herself
nodding. Doreen, on the other is turning ash-white.

                       DOREEN
          Oh no. This is what always
          happens. He's going for it.

                        MOLLY
          Go for it!

                        DOREEN
          No! He just needs par to tie!
          Tell him to lay up! He listens to
          you!

                        MOLLY
          Go for it, Roy! Knock it on!

                        DOREEN
          This is why we split up -- he
          always went for it...

                        MOLLY
          My problem is I've never been with

                                                                 126.
                a man who went for it...

                              DOREEN
                Well, honey, he's your guy.


      BACK TO TIN CUP

      He selects the three wood.    Romeo sighs.


152   EXT. TELEVISION TOWER - DAY                                152

                              NANTZ
                Good Lord, he's going for the
                green.

                              VENTURI
                This could be tragic.


153   EXT. EIGHTEENTH FAIRWAY                                    153

      Tin Cup's eyes focus with the look of eagles as he
      addresses the shot.

                              TIN CUP
                One swing, Roy. One good swing.
                Dollar bills...

      He swings -- the ball explodes off his club.   Tin Cup
      holds the pose...

                                TIN CUP
                We're home...

      Suddenly a gust of wind blows, out of nowhere, and Tin
      Cup's cap blows off, provoking immediate concern.

                              TIN CUP
                ... little gust there, Romes...


154   TELEVISION MONITOR                                         154

      Picking up the flight of the ball approaching the green,
      carried it seems by the swelling roar of the gallery.
      The ball clears the water...

      ... and lands at the top of the slope fronting the
      elevated green. It pops up in the air, lands just past
      where it hit, and comes momentarily to rest. The gallery
      roars. And then:

      The ball starts trickling back down the slope, gaining
      speed, moving towards the water, even as the gallery
      screams for it to stop...

                                                                 127.

      ... until finally it disappears into the water with
      scarcely a ripple.


155   BACK TO TIN CUP                                            155

      He stares first with betrayal, then with anger, and
      looks at Romeo, who just shrugs, then at Molly.

                              MOLLY
                You can still make par from up
                there --

                              ROMEO
                She's right, Pods, a drop and a
                stroke, up and down par -- we'll
                win it in sudden death.

      But Tin Cup still has the look of eagles. He's staring
      at the shot he just made, still holding the three wood.

                              TIN CUP
                I nutted that thing. Little gust
                from the gods cost me...

                              ROMEO
                Helluva move you put on that
                sucker, now let's get up there,
                take the drop, and make our par,
                tie Peter...

                              TIN CUP
                I can make this shot.

                              ROMEO
                Not now.

                              TIN CUP
                Now.

      Tin Cup throws another ball on the ground.

                              TIN CUP
                I'm playing it from here.

                              MOLLY
                Take your drop and make your par!

      Tin Cup addresses the ball.

                                                    CUT TO:


156   EXT. TELEVISION TOWER                                      156

      Venturi nearly comes out of seat watching Tin Cup take a

                                                                  128.
      drop from his original lie.

                              VENTURI
                I don't believe this. He just
                took himself out of the tournament
                with that drop. He could have
                walked up to the hazard line,
                saved par with a wedge and forced
                a playoff with Jacobsen. Now he
                needs a miracle shot.

                              McCORD (V.O.)
                Ken, I'm right behind McAvoy here.
                And all he said to his caddie was:
                I can make it across.


157   EXT. EIGHTEENTH FAIRWAY - DAY                               157

      Tin Cup swings again -- The ball sails long and true once
      again, and once again...


158   ... it lands into the hill, bounces once, and trickles      158
      back into the water.

                               VENTURI (V.O.)
                Oh, my.   This is tragic.


159   BACK TO TIN CUP                                             159

      Holding his hand out to Romeo, as the gallery murmurs
      uncomfortably.

                              TIN CUP
                Gimme another ball.


      BACK TO DOREEN AND MOLLY

      watching behind the ropes.

                              MOLLY
                I can't believe he's doing this.

                              DOREEN
                       (unfazed)
                I can, honey...

                              MOLLY
                He can blow the whole tournament!

                              DOREEN
                It's a miracle he lasted this
                long...

                                                                129.

      waiting at the green, amidst the rest of the gallery
      who's in shock about Tin Cup's decisions to keep going
      for it, keep trying to prove a point.

                               CLINT
                 He done blew a gasket, boys...

                 It was a miracle while it
                 lasted...


      REGULARS' POV

      Tin Cup swings a third time.

                                                      CUT TO:


161   EXT. EIGHTEENTH GREEN - DAY                               161

      A BALL lands SPLOOSH! in the WATER, and...


162   BACK UP FAIRWAY                                           162

      Tin Cup holds out his hand for yet another ball, saying
      nothing.

      Romeo hands him another ball.

      Tin Cup unloads another 3-wood.    Another splash.

      Tin Cup holds out his hand again.

                               ROMEO
                 This is your last ball, man. If
                 this gets wet, you disqualified.

                               TIN CUP
                 I can make it across.

      Tin Cup snatches the ball from Romeo's hand.


163   EXT. TELEVISION TOWER                                     163

      Venturi and Nantz can barely look at the monitor.

                                                                  130.

                              VENTURI
                This is the most painful thing
                I've ever watched.

                              McCORD (V.O.)
                Jim, this is the last ball he has
                in his bag. If he doesn't finish
                the hole with it, he can't turn in
                a card. He'll be disqualified.

      Venturi and Nantz cover their eyes.

      Tin Cup unloads another three wood -- another splash.

164   BACK TO TIN CUP                                             164

      He looks at Molly.

      CLOSE ON MOLLY

      She's just laughing.

      Romeo tosses down another ball -- Tin Cup launches
      his fifth attempt to clear the pond. Splash.

                              MOLLY
                You're right, Roy, what the hell!
                Let 'er rip!

                              DOREEN
                You two are made for each other.

      BACK TO TIN CUP

      This is still all business to him.    He sets his jaw,
      addresses the shot, and:

                              TIN CUP
                Dollar bills...

      He swings -- another perfect shot... but this time the
      wind relents a knot, and:

165   BALL                                                        165

      clears the water, clears the slope, hits the front of the
      green, rolls up toward the pin, and drops in the hole.
      The gallery goes berserk!

166   BACK TO TIN CUP                                             166

      Raising his three wood aloft in triumph, he looks over at
      Molly and finally cracks a smile.

                                                                   131.

166   CONTINUED:                                                   166

      And when she smiles back, he takes his hat off and walks
      to the green, to as great an ovation as the game has ever
      heard.

      Tin Cup and Simms sign their cards and get up to leave in
      unison. Simms turns to Tin Cup and has to shake his
      head.

                                 SIMMS
                   I gotta hand it to you, Roy.   When
                   you go down, you go down in
                   flames.

                                 TIN CUP
                   Someday you can tell your
                   grandchildren you finished second

                          (beat)
                   -- just don't tell 'em how.

      And he moves brusquely past Simms and out of the tent,
      congratulating Tubbs, the winner, as he passes.

                   Good job, Tubbsy... you won it.

      And out of the scorer's tent...


169   EXT. SCORER'S TENT                                           169

      A roar goes up from the milling fans as Tin Cup emerges.
      He tries to smile, but it's all dawning on him.

                                 TIN CUP
                   My God... I just gave away the
                   Open...

      And then McCord is there, shoving a mike in Tin Cup's
      face.

                                                                  132.
                               McCORD
                 Ledge, I know it's tough to talk
                 right now, but --

                               TIN CUP
                 It's not difficult to talk... it's
                 difficult to explain... I coulda
                 laid up and still won. I made a
                 twelve on the last hole of the U.S.
                 Open. You know how much money
                 that cost me?

                               McCORD
                 Cost you a bundle...

                               TIN CUP
                 I gotta get outta here.

                               McCORD
                 It was the greatest 12 I ever saw.
                 Back to you, Jim...

       Tin Cup exits the scorers' tent and runs into the
       regulars -- They're beaming, undyingly loyal.

                               CLINT AND EARL
                 Greatest 12 I ever saw... you
                 crunched that dog, baby...
                 gorgeous shot, etc...

       He looks up and there's Molly -- He stops short.    They
       embrace.

                               TIN CUP
                 Molly, I'm an idiot. I gave away
                 the Open. The one time in my life
                 I know the play is to hit the lay
                 up -- my whole life and future
                 and career on the line, and I
                 still can't make myself do it. I
                 am a twisted human being and a
                 cautionary tale. And I guess I'm
                 a fool?

                                MOLLY
                 Yes.   A magnificent fool...

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:


A170   EXT. DRIVING RANGE (SALOME) - NIGHT                            A170

       Mosquitoes, pools of light, the TRACTOR CHUGS around
       picking up balls.

                                                       CUT TO:

B170   INT. DRIVING RANGE CAFE - NIGHT                          B170

       Romeo and Doreen eye each other -- locked in a stare
       of longing and mystery. TANGO MUSIC comes from a
       BOOM BOX. They begin to move toward each other
       in a tango step.

                                                      CUT TO:


170    EXT. DRIVING RANGE - NIGHT                               170

       Tin Cup and Molly are sitting, feet up, a couple Lone
       Star beers beside them, just taking in the warm Texas
       night. Her head rests on his shoulder. The world at
       peace.

                               TIN CUP
                 Some people don't like West Texas
                 but I think it's the most
                 beautiful place on earth...

                               MOLLY
                 It has its charms...
                        (beat)
                 Y'know, by finishing in the top 15
                 at the Open you qualified to be in
                 it next year --

                               TIN CUP
                 Damn, I didn't know that...

                               MOLLY
                 I'm thinking with your game you
                 should go back to the Qualifying
                 School, try to get out on tour...

                               TIN CUP
                 Then I wouldn't see you...

                               MOLLY
                 Actually, I picked up a whole
                 bunch of new clients at the Open.
                 Lotta guys on the tour said if I
                 could do that much for you,
                 imagine what I could do for
                 them...

                               TIN CUP
                 There's a lotta head cases out
                 there, you could make a bundle...

                               MOLLY
                 And sleep in the Winnebago at
                 night...

                                                             134.
Silence.

                         TIN CUP
           Y'know... a man goes through what
           I've gone through, he's supposed
           to learn something.
                  (beat)
           I'm trying to figure out what I
           learned. Did I learn anything?

                         MOLLY
           You're learning some discipline and
           self-control...

                         TIN CUP
           And that there's a time in life to
           play it safe...

                           MOLLY
           That's great,   Roy... and I'm learning
           how to listen   to the tuning fork,
           throw caution   to the wind, and take
           crazy risks I   never thought were
           possible...

                         TIN CUP
           C'mon, Molly, when did you ever take
           a crazy risk?

                         MOLLY
           I fell for you...


WIDE SHOT - LANDSCAPE

A desolate driving range outside of Salome, Texas. Bugs,
trucks passing in the night, and a tiny RADIO SENDING
GEORGE JONES across the plains.

                                                 FADE OUT.
