          I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to
          present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable
          to God, which is your spiritual worship. Do not be conformed
          to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind,
          that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what
          is good and acceptable and perfect. -Romans 12:1-2

                   The world cares, April. But it's
                   not a question of physical
                   superiority, it's "What skin color
                   is more culturally advantageous?"
                         
          As Parker drones on Chris looks around the party. Dean
          schmoozes animatedly with two couples. He quickly scans the
          party, finds Chris and points him out. The two couples wave
          and smile giddily. They had all just been talking about him.
          Chris pretends to not see this.

          crowd. Relief. It is Andre, the jogger from the first scene,
          but he's very different than before.

          He seems glazed-over with the same frozen smile as Walter and
          Georgina, and wears a particularly square ascot and golfing
          hat.

          Andre turns to face Chris neatly. Andre's voice is completely
          different from the first scene. There is no longer any trace
          of an urban dialect. He speaks in a lower pitch and slow,

          Chris' phone lays on the dresser plugged in. He's in a hurry
          now. He packs his small bag and looks out the window. One car
          remains parked in the designated parking area. It's the first
          to have arrived for the party: Jim Hudson's. The driver brings
          the dog to the back seat. He gets a green envelope from the
          glove compartment and brings it to Missy at the front door.
          She accepts it silently.
                         
          The driver drives away without Jim.
                         
          Chris goes to leave Rose's room. Her closet creaks open. Chris
          sees a framed picture of Rose inside. Not quite knowing what
          he's looking for, he goes to the closet. The picture is a
          frightening one. Rose is one of the witches in a high school
          production of Macbeth. It's on top of a red shoebox that has
          the drama/comedy masks drawn on top of it.
                         
          He takes it off of the shelf. Inside is a pile of pictures. On
          top is one of Rose dressed as Juliet in a high school play.
                                                                      72.
                         
          The next one is of Rose at 13 playing Ms. Hannigan in Annie.
          Chris flips through a few more pictures of Rose at different
          ages in different class plays.
                         
          Finally Chris comes upon a photo printed from a computer. It's
          a selfie of her and some other black guy. The picture is
          almost identical to the one she took with Chris before the
          ride up. Under the image are written the words. "X-mas 2014"
          Stunned, Chris flips to the next picture. It's another
          romantic selfie, this time with a different black guy.
          Underneath, the caption "Memorial Day 2013"
                         
          He continues flipping through the stack of pictures of Rose
          with 8 different black guys. The last one is a picture of Rose
          with Walter. In it she kisses Walter's cheek intimately.
          "Thanksgiving 2009" Walter looks different in the picture. He
          isn't smiling vaguely; he's got swagger.

                   Okay so... You see the blue part?
                   That's the piece of your brain
                   that's all rooted in the nervous
                   system. So that stays; keeping
                   those tricky little connections
                   intact. The rest is discarded.
                   Then they'll remove the red part
                   of my brain from my skull and put
                   in yours. Your "blue" and my "red"
                   basically absorb each other. And
                   apparently the brain heals
                   surprisingly fast, so assuming

          Jeremy exits the room briskly and walks down a dark hallway.
          He turns into the games room and finds Rose's body.
                         
          Jeremy's eyes go wild. He turns as Chris emerges lunging from
          the darkness with a badminton racket. Before Jeremy can
          scream, Chris slams him in the face with the metal side of the
          racket. He pulls Jeremy inside and shuts the door cutting off
          the sound from outside. Jeremy wilts in pain.
                         
          Chris whips him over and over warping the racket to a crumpled
          bloody mess.

          his arms. He punctures Dean through his neck and shoulder with

          His call to Missy devolves into gargles. Dean falls knocking
          the unused bed over along with some candles. The bed has
          caught fire. The fire grows fast.

          Missy takes a whistling tea pot off the stove and pours
          herself a cup. Georgina sits nearby knitting. The window, like
          before reflects the room around them.
                         
          She sniffs the air. She is suddenly afraid. She turns off the
          light illuminating the back yard. Walter runs back and forth
          in the distance. She turns the light back on again. Chris'
          reflection is now behind hers. He looks savage; covered in
          blood. Georgina screams and runs out the back door.
                         
          Chris heads to the door, but sees his phone on the dining room
          table. He goes for it.

          Chris picks up his phone and presses the power button. The
          loading screen comes up.
                         
          Chris grunts with frustration as he hears a creak behind him.
          It's Missy, now in the kitchen doorway behind him holding her
          teacup and spoon. She begins clinking her tea cup...

          The cat bounds off the dining room table at Chris' face. Chris
          punches it out of the air. This has given Missy enough time to
          grab a knife. She lunges at Chris screaming psychotically.
          Chris can't pin her down. She slices his hands. Chris grabs
          the tea pot and cracks her in the head with it. She falls. He
          hits her one more time. Done.

          hears a footsteps running upstairs from the basement followed
          bloodcurdling scream from back in the kitchen:

          Jeremy bursts though the dining room and pounces on Chris'
          back. The two roll around.
                         
          Chris throws his elbow back at Jeremy who blocks it and uses
          it to put Chris in a choke hold from behind. Chris slams the
          back of his head into Jeremy's face. He does it again, and
          again, and again. Jeremy squeezes tighter.
                         
          Chris, about to pass out, reaches into Jeremy's pocket and
          pulls out his keys. He scrapes them deep into Jeremy's eye.
          Jeremy screams in pain and Chris wriggles out of his grasp
          tripping him with an improvised Judo throw. Jeremy lunges at
          Chris again but slips on his own blood banging the back of his
          head on the coffee table. He's out.
