          EXT. NEW YORK CITY - BLOOMINGDALE'S - DAY

          The busy block between 59th and 60th-Streets in the
          middle of a weekday afternoon. Buses, taxis, trucks;
          shoppers, messengers, teenagers. In one corner of the
          screen the time is SUPERIMPOSED:

                         "1:52"
          Now a man (GREEN) is ZOOMED IN on -- little of his actual
          face is visible because of his thick white hair, large
          bushy white mustache, dark glasses and slouch hat. The
          rest of him is encased in a knee-length raincoat. He
          wears gloves and is carrying a large, brown-paper-covered
          package by a wooden handle attached to the twine securing
           it. The box has been addressed in black felt marker --
          "Everest Printing Corp., 826. Lafayette St." -- and appears
          quite heavy. But Green has the gait of a man. younger than
          he appears. As he turns and heads down a flight of stairs,
          CAMERA ZOOMS IN even more to the single word on a sign:

          "SUBWAY."

          INT. SUBWAY - 59TH ST. CHANGE BOOTH - DAY

          A level above the locals, two above the express trains.
          Green appears and joins the line waiting to buy tokens.
          Wordlessly he shoves two coins under the grille, receives
          his token, moves on, drops it into the slot, pushes
          through the turnstile and heads for one of the descending
          stairways. CAMERA HOLDS on a sign identifying his choice:

          "IRT. LEX. AVE. LOCAL. DOWNTOWN.."

          INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - 59TH ST. DOWNTOWN LOCAL - DAY

          Green comes off the stairs and arrives on a line with a
          placard that hangs over the edge of the platform bearing
          the number "10", black on a white ground, indicating the
          point where the front of a ten-car train stops. Now the
          sound of a distant rumbling, growing louder, makes Green
          turn,.cross to the platform's edge, lean out over the
          track and peer into the darkness of the tunnel beyond the
          far end of the platform.

          SUBWAY TUNNEL - GREEN'S POV
          as the four lights -- amber and white markers over white
          sealed-beam headlights -- come into view and the train
          roars and clatters into the station. CAMERA PANS with
          the head car as it stops, its breaks sighing, and a pair
          of doors in EXTREME FOREGROUND, rattles open. CAMERA now
          MOVES forward, into the car, then TURNS and through the
          still-open door, focuses on the T.A. Cop, still standing
          on the platform, regarding Green (CAMERA).

          The door to the conductor's cab is open as Bud continues to

           51ST ST. STATION - BUD'S POV
           SHOOTING THROUGH the conductor's window as the train
           enters the station. We flash by the "rear-enders" (those
          I waiting for the last car) and gradually slow until we
          stop -- and we are looking right into the face of a man
          (GREY) whose frame and features, while entirely different
          from Green's, are covered by the same identical externals
          -- thick white hair, bushy white mustache, dark glasses,
          slouch hat, gloves and raincoat. He looks at the conduc-
          tor (CAMERA) for an instant, then darts away.

          track. He carries a large tan valise trimmed in dark
          brown.

          INT. FOURTH CAR

          Grey just makes it to the car as the doors close, holding
          them back until he's squeezed through. The train starts
          with a lurch as he heads for the rear of the car and takes
          up a position, leaning his back against the storm door and
          placing his valise on the floor, between his feet. He
          surveys the car with cold, heavy-lidded eyes.

          INT. FIRST CAR

          Green has a seat opposite the shut steel door of the
          motorman's cab. His package is on the floor, between
          his knees, his arms resting on its top. TWO BOYS, ten
          and twelve, brothers, are at the window of the front storm
          door, their eyes glued to the track and tunnel before
          them, playing.: at driving the train.

          bushy mustache, dark glasses, a lot of white hair, a slouch
          hat and, covering the rest of him, a raincoat. He carries
          an outsized florist's box, big enough for several dozen-

          hand and the trombone in the other, he approaches the

          middle-aged man with a ruddy face and wearing pin-striped
          overalls, is leaning far gut of his window, looking back
          along the platform. Blue puts down his bags, puts his
          right hand into his raincoat pocket and leans against the
          train with his left shoulder, blocking Doyle's view of
          the rest of the train.

          other Towers. The predominant feature of the room, however,

          superimposed on a painted map showing the line's track

          at his belt and unbuttons the strap, freeing it. Then he
          assumes the stance of a gunfighter, hand poised over it,
          knees slightly bent. Then, moving suddenly, he slaps his
          holster, wheels, fires without aiming -- and there's a
          reverberating BANG, the shattering of glass and the figure
          in the subway car reels back. James looks at his hand in
          amazement -- there's no gun in it. Then, at the same-time,

          as the rope with the red wooden handle, which dangles
          some six inches from a hole in the ceiling of the car,
          is cut by a pair of clippers inserted into the hole.

          Including Grey who is cutting the brake cord at the other
          end of the car. Now, submachine gun in hand, Brown opens
          the front storm door, crouches and drops out of sight.
          Then Grey starts for the rear door, hesitates, returns
          to the Hooker and bends to whisper something in her ear.

          disappears. At the front of.the car, Green backs out of
          the door, closing it after him, and is helped down to the
          roadbed by Brown from below. Only Blue is left. He holds
          his submachine gun easily cradled in one arm as he moves
          through the car.

          the metal landing. Then he closes the door and drops down
          to the track. The Passengers, left alone, look at one
          another uncertainly.

          The train starts to move. As it does, Green tugs sharply
          back on the pipe and the two longer sections, angled

          to lose his balance but Brawn grabs him and pulls him back

          MED. SHOT - HIPPIE
          He returns his attention to the business of locating his
          gun. He scrapes the heel of an extended leg (to his extreme
          discomfort) along the ground hoping to discover it -- and
          does. Seeing it, he now goes through the painful exercise
          of reaching for it -- finally managing this, too. Now,
          lifting one knee as a gun mount, he holds the revolver in
          both hands and starts to take aim.

          with the gun in the foreground, its sight being shifted as
          the three men are preparing to leave through the emergency
          exit. Now the Hippie's vision (FOCUS) blurs for a moment,
          and when it clears, Green has already disappeared through
          the door and Brown is right behind him. The gunsight centers
          on Brown's broad back -- and the gun fires. Brown convulses
          and topples backwards.

          that leads up through a grate and out onto the street.
          Between them, before the open doorway to the well, Brown's
