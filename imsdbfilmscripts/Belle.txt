    A series of shots.

    Blue sky through shabby windows.
    Run down walls. A paint splashed pine floor.    Tens of paint
    brushes soaking in stained jars.
    An artisan's hands - weather-worn, swirling a paint brush
    in dirty water that sways at the bottom of one of the jars.

    A canvas - the sketched face of a woman - blonde, blue eyed
    as the artisan strokes paint into her features - a poster
    girl for 18th century portraiture. (We will later
    recognise her as ELIZABETH MURRAY)

    A swallow cuts across a red tinged sky.   SOUND of footsteps
    trudging through mud.
    EXTREME CLOSE UP: a small figure being dressed by someone -
    a shoulder, an arm, little hands. We do not see a face.
    CLOSE: heavy naval boots move at sombre pace through slums.

    A CHILD'S POV as the door opens. We see a gentleman in
    ceremonial naval dress - CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY,
    aristocratic, handsome...alarmed at the sight before him.

    His eyes close with some sad, internal pain and as they re-
    open...We see what he sees...
    A fragile girl...around six years old stands in shabby
    surroundings. Her terrified eyes stare back, leaving
    LINDSAY at a loss. He takes in her features - delicate
    with a full mouth that underlines her ethnicity.

    She is DIDO ELIZABETH BELLE...part black, part white.
                                                                 2.


    He speaks quietly- words almost as fragile as she is.

                        CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY
              Hello little girl...Little Dido.
                  (pause)
              I am your father.
    Silence. Then a tear rises to the surface and as her
    confused tears spill, so too do LINDSAY'S.

    His POV: a POOR BLACK WOMAN oversees DIDO from afar.
                        CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT'D)
                  (re. Dido)
              How lovely she is. So much of her
              mother.
                  (his eyes sting)
              I tried...but how...how could I
              separate a mother from her child?
                  (he restrains tears)
              And now nature has deprived me of
              such a dilemma.
    He composes himself - feeling futile...

                        CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT'D)
              Thank you..for taking her.
    He reaches into his pocket, holds out money to the woman.
                        CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT'D)
              You may leave us.

    The WOMAN hesitates, scurries to DIDO, placing her lips to
    the child's head in a prolonged kiss. Then she is gone.
    DIDO is left frightened and stunned!

                        CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT'D)
              Do not be afraid sweet thing. I
              am to take you to a good life.
              The life you were born to.

    He takes out a cube of chocolate, shows it to her. She is
    reluctant. He takes a bite - delicious! DIDO moves
    forward. He puts the chocolate in her hand. She tastes
    it. Sweet cocoa and sugar..and now her tiny mouth is
    filled. It makes LINDSAY laugh out loud.

    Silence, except bird song - the splendor of the English
    countryside - A neoclassical estate stretches before us.
    The figure of a LITTLE GIRL running across the lawns - her
    giggle fills the air, her outline faded by the sun.
    At French doors to the nursery, a furious greying woman -
    LADY MARY MURRAY (40s), waves a wooden spoon and yells...

               Elizabeth Murray, bring yourself
               back here this very moment!

    The child crashes to the grass in fits of laughter. She is
    no more than 6 years old - Hair the colour of bleached hay
    and delicate pale skin.

    She rolls on to her back, squinting at the sunlight as...
    The SOUND of horse and carriage at the front of the house.

    LADY MANSFIELD (40s), the years have been kind. She is
    beautiful, regal - stares ahead in shock...
    LORD MANSFIELD (50's) - a majestic man, white wigged and
    low brows, is incandescent, his sister, LADY MARY, frozen.

                         LORD MANSFIELD
               What in God's name have you done!!

    Their POV - LINDSAY and little DIDO stand.
                         LADY MANSFIELD
               She...she is black.

    LINDSAY is pained.

          find me a fool? She is a MULATTO!

LORD MANSFIELD'S blood boils, he rages towards LINDSAY. LADY
MANSFIELD restrains him. LINDSAY is red with humiliation.

                    CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY
          I have no wife to take her...In a
          few hours I am to captain a

          not in my gift to question the
          King and his Royal Navy.

LINDSAY lowers his voice, shielding DIDO.

          Her mother is dead! My wishes may
          not be orthodox but they ARE

His firm gaze holds his aunt and uncle to account. A long
beat. LADY MANSFIELD stands conflicted.
                    LADY MANSFIELD
          What has she been named?
                    SIR JOHN LINDSAY

          Dido Elizabeth Belle...Lindsay.

          We cannot have another
          Elizabeth in the household.
LADY MANSFIELD regards the child, then looks to her
husband, gravely. He turns his back - aggrieved.

                    LADY MANSFIELD
          We...we will call her Dido.
              (off Lindsay's nod)
          Good Lord, she is thin. Mary,
          find her something to eat.
LORD MANSFIELD storms from the room. LADY MANSFIELD
follows. LINDSAY kneels, choked with emotion.

          place for one so precious as you.
              (pause)
          In these walls, yours will be a
          life equal to my blood.
A beat. Through eyes that brim...he catches his breath.
LADY MARY is both stunned and moved - she has to turn away.
                    SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT'D)
          You will not understand in this
          moment, but hold this in your
          heart...you are loved...Just as
          I loved your mother.
A tear spills and DIDO's little fingers come up to wipe it
from his cheek. He presses his lips to her hand, sobbing a
moment, and then he is gone - to stay any longer would be
too much to bare.
                                                                 6.

    ELIZABETH makes her way across...taking her aunt's hand as

              Are you what they call `a negro?'
              I heard them talking.

              Tis a most irritating trait you

              Murray. You should not insist on
              always speaking your mind, you

              with only your own company for
              entertainment!

    DIDO is left alone - through the doorway of the gallery, a
    portrait of LINDSAY stares at her. She gazes at it.

    LORD MANSFIELD approaches, arrested at the sight of DIDO,
    newly tidied. He follows her gaze to LINDSAY'S image. The
    sight affects him, unexpectedly.

                I am here too....do you see?

    Her eyes search the long line of her aristocratic heritage,
    until her gaze settles. He chuckles, reluctantly charmed as
    she points to his likeness.

                Yes...I am William Murray, First

    A beat as he looks to her, affected by this little person.
    Gently, he leads her to a final portrait.

    gently takes DIDO'S hand in hers, leads her off to run
    between the trees. As their delighted screams filter...
    LADY MANSFIELD enters - observes LORD Mansfield, a moment.

          LORD MANSFIELD
Indeed. He discovered her mother
aboard a captured Spanish slave
ship. He was charged with
conveying it back to these
shores, he tells me.
          LADY MANSFIELD
Evidently he had some...`feeling'
for the woman.
          LORD MANSFIELD
    (dry)
And there I was believing it was
sheer lack of `self control'.
    (scathing)
He has been at sea, six years.
All of this child's life!
          LADY MANSFIELD
Well, he clearly saw to their
wellbeing. The child is not
altogether uncivilized.
    (she breathes deeply)
So...now we have two nieces in
our guardianship.
           LORD MANSFIELD
    (reticent)
Elizabeth was much in need of a
companion.

          LADY MANSFIELD
And that is what we shall say
when questions are asked of us?
          LORD MANSFIELD
We shall say that in accordance
with her birthright, she is
entitled to live beneath this roof.
    (with irony)
Such...is the nature of `order'.

          LADY MANSFIELD
And where in this `order' should
her colour be placed? Below or
above her Murray bloodline?
    (off his silence)
May she dine with us?
          LORD MANSFIELD
She may...(pause)...NOT...in
company. We cannot escape
society's confines on etiquette
            LADY MANSFIELD
Marriage?
                                                                  9.


     He shakes his head at the complexity of it all.

                         LORD MANSFIELD
               Impossible. Any match her..'other
               origins' may attract would surely
               disgrace her and the family rank.
                         LADY MANSFIELD
               And when we are no longer here? No
               husband - who will take care of her?
     He rubs his eyebrows, perturbed, turns back to the lawns.

     He is chaotically handsome with deeply set, expressive eyes

     gaze moves suddenly to LORD MANSFIELD - intense, as he
     watches him drift from the church, the family in tow.

                    WIMBRIDGE
          Of course, sir. I will see that
          he gets it immediately...

DIDO can't help but interfere. She calls over her shoulder.
                    DIDO
          You shall not interrupt him at
          dinner, Wimbridge!
                    WIMBRIDGE
          Immediately - after dinner, sir.
JOHN resists rolling his eyes - ghastly female!

                    JOHN
          Yes, of course...thank you.
He backs away. DIDO still shows him nothing but her back.

                    JOHN (CONT'D)
              (to Wimbridge, awkward)
          Good night.

                    WIMBRIDGE
          Good night, sir.
He moves off, and is gone as DIDO finally turns, stares at
the closed door, flushed.
                                                                  18.


25   INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM. CONTINUOUS - NIGHT. 4.     25    *

     A single figure - at the farthest end of the crimson
     drawing room...DIDO'S heart skips a beat at the SOUND of
     the approaching dinner party...Suddenly the doors open
     ...DIDO stands quickly - nervous.

                         LORD MANSFIELD
               Dido...my dear.

                         LADY ASHFORD
                   (whispers to her sons)
               Good Lord - the negro! She really is...
                          JAMES ASHFORD
                   (quietly disturbed)
               ...a lady.

                          OLIVER
               Capital!
                         LADY ASHFORD
               I hadn't expected her to look
               so...black.
                         OLIVER
               Mamaa, did you not listen to the
               rumours when you were spreading
               them?
     DIDO curtseys respectfully to LORD MANSFIELD.
                         LORD MANSFIELD
               May I present to you the second
               of my nieces - Miss Dido Lindsay.

     DIDO curtseys. LADY ASHFORD nods graciously. OLIVER bows -
     has to nudge his troubled brother do the same.

                         OLIVER
               A pleasure, Miss Lindsay.

     She curtseys once again, then moves to sit with ELIZABETH.

                         ELIZABETH
                   (sotto - re. James)
               He is the eldest - to inherit the
               entire Ashford fortune. He is
               also to inherit from his uncle -
               a healthy man, who shows little
               sign of departure.

                         DIDO
               How do you know?
                                                          19.


                    ELIZABETH
          Lady Ashford herself. She seems
          rather despondent at her
          brother's robust constitution.

JAMES catches DIDO'S soft brown eyes resting on him.
                    DIDO
          He has much to recommend him. And
          a second fortune in life should
          please any wife.
ELIZABETH clocks the gaze between DIDO and JAMES.
                    ELIZABETH
          Dido! You are not to be a
          coquette with him! You already
          have your fortune!
                    DIDO
          Are you suggesting I now
          condescend to a gentleman without
          means, Bette?! What should good
          society think of us!
OLIVER moves to his brother, follows his gaze to DIDO.
                    OLIVER
          She is intriguing, is she not?

                    JAMES
          I find her repulsive.
                    OLIVER
          I suppose she is...if you find a
          most rare and exotic flower so.
          She is quite something to behold.

ON DIDO as she falters under the brothers' stares.
                    ELIZABETH
              (flustered, to DIDO)
          Good Lord! They are appraising me!
ELIZABETH composes herself. JAMES' eyes remain on DIDO,
swallowing hard at her undeniable beauty.

                    JAMES
          One does not make a wife of the
          rare and exotic, Oliver. One
          samples it on the cotton fields
          of the Indies...

                    OLIVER
          So far, when it is right at my door?
                                                               20.


                         JAMES
               ...Then finds a pure ENGLISH rose
               to decorate one's home.
     OLIVER smiles. OFF both men - trained on DIDO.


26   INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT 4.               26    *
     ELIZABETH is at the pianoforte. She sings, plays hard, for
     JAMES' attention, gazing up at him as he stands beside her.
                         LADY ASHFORD
               Is she `OUT'??

                          LADY MANSFIELD
                   (embarrassed)
               Not quite.
                         LADY MARY
                   (awkward)
               Any day now.

     LADY ASHFORD raises an amused eyebrow - precocious creature!
     OLIVER offers DIDO a discreet smile, as she sits beside
     LORD MANSFIELD. His mother quietly moves across to him.
                          LADY ASHFORD
               You will refrain from any
               intercourse with the negress.
                   (beat)
               Lord and Lady Mansfield may find
               it fascinating to have a Lady
               Mulatto running around their
               household, but I will not have
               one running around mine!

                         OLIVER
               She is an heiress.
     A seamless change of heart for LADY ASHFORD.
                          LADY ASHFORD
               Although exceptions can be made.

                         OLIVER
               It is said that her father left
               her a rather vast fortune.

                         LADY ASHFORD
               I mean to say, if that is your
               inclination.

                         OLIVER
               She is rather soft on the eye - I
               have thought no further Mamaa.
                                                             21.


LADY ASHFORD stares across at DIDO.

                    LADY ASHFORD
          From where did you receive your
          information?
                    OLIVER
          Her sister-cousin has a rather
          fast tongue.

ON LADY ASHFORD as she studies DIDO. ELIZABETH finishes,
amid a smattering of polite applause led by JAMES.

                    OLIVER (CONT'D)
          And what of you Miss Lindsay?
          Are we to hear you play tonight?

DIDO looks up to find OLIVER smiling across at her.
                    DIDO
          Well...
              (deferring to her father)
          Papaa...?

LORD MANSFIELD hesitates. DIDO is embarrassed.

                    OLIVER
          Oh do not be selfish with your
          good fortune, m'lord!
A beat...then put on the spot, LORD MANSFIELD caves,
throwing up his hands, helplessly.

DIDO is tentative, ELIZABETH less pleased.
                    LADY ASHFORD
          This will be most interesting!
DIDO moves to the pianoforte settles her fingers on the
keys. A beat, then Handel's Suite No.9 fills the room.

LORD MANSFIELD closes his eyes, irritated with himself.
LADY MARY whispers to LADY MANSFIELD.
                    LADY MARY
          She has never played in company!
LADY MANSFIELD is silent - stiff with anxiety.

DIDO is raising a beautiful and fluent sound - as skillful
as the most gifted of Georgian young ladies.
LORD MANSFIELD'S eyes spring open - sees all held hostage.
OLIVER moves forward, utterly fascinated.
Relief floods LADY MANSFIELD - she sighs with pride as LADY
MARY lends LADY ASHFORD a smug look.
                                                                   22.

               She is...most accomplished.
                         LADY MANSFIELD
                   (with deep satisfaction)
               Hers was a most diligent governess.


27   INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. UPSTAIRS CORRIDORS - NIGHT. 4             27    *

     Echoing footsteps. LORD and LADY MANSFIELD move toward
     their rooms, each with a lamp to light their way.
                         LADY MANSFIELD
               The liberty of asking her to
               play! And when he can have no
               better intentions towards her.
     She stops in her tracks briefly, suddenly unsure...
                            LADY MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
               Can he??

     They round a corner.
                         LADY MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
               ...His family name will, no doubt,
               entice her to take him seriously.
                         LORD MANSFIELD
               She must not delude herself. Such
               decisions are not hers to make.
                         LADY MANSFIELD
               Then spell it out to her! Before
               she renders herself...sport to
               some `gent' of cruel promises!!!
                         LORD MANSFIELD
               She has no reason. Hers is an
               inheritance that renders her free
               of the usual inducements to marry.

                         LADY MANSFIELD
               Well, that, at least, is true,
                   (burdened, grave)
               Indeed, it is Elizabeth who needs
               to secure her bread and butter.


28   INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. GROUND FLOOR CORRIDORS/STUDIO. DAY. 5 28        *
     Feminine feet move along the corridor.   REVEAL DIDO making
     her way to LORD MANSFIELD'S study.

     Her POV: through the doorway to the studio.
                                                                 23.


     An UNFAMILIAR FACE mixing paints, engrossed. His weather-
     worn hands are recognisable from the opening credits. His
     stare meets DIDO's, calmly moved by her beauty as she
     stands, frozen - her full lips parted in astonishment.


29   INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. DIDO AND ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - DAY. 5 29      *
     ELIZABETH stands at the mirror - a maid dressing her.

               A portrait? Are you sure?

                         DIDO
               Yes...Aunt Mary has confirmed it.

     DIDO sits, light headed, anxiety running through her.

                         ELIZABETH
               Good Lord. How...truly wonderful.

                         DIDO

30   INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. LORD MANSFIELD'S STUDY. DAY. 5          30    *
     DIDO hurls herself into the room, utterly panicked.

               Papaa...should he not have wished
               to SEE me before deciding?

     She throws her hands up woefully, and finds another face
     staring back at her - It is JOHN DAVINIER. He regards her
     from a huge law book. She stands mortified.
                         DIDO (CONT'D)

     She curtseys, brief and stiff - a smile to match.
                                                   24.


                    LORD MANSFIELD
          Decide what?
She is hesitant now, awkward in JOHN'S presence.

                    DIDO
          If he should...should WANT to
          paint me!

                    LORD MANSFIELD
          The man is to be paid a fortune.
          What is there to decide?

                      DIDO
          But...

                    LORD MANSFIELD
          Dido, you are to simply sit
          still. Not a challenging task!

                    LORD MANSFIELD
          As you always are - right beside
          one another.
DIDO's chest heaves with distress.
                    JOHN
          Should...should not any lady be
          flattered to be such a subject?

His tone is impatient, irritating her.
                    DIDO
          How should any male know the ways
          of a lady when he has not even
          mastered the ways of a gentleman?

                    JOHN
          Quite! Though one should be
          forgiven for thinking he was in
          the presence of a lady - when she
          is, in fact, still a juvenile!
                    DIDO
          Papaa, may we do this in private!

                    LORD MANSFIELD
          Not now, no! You may return the
          books to the library.

LORD MANSFIELD casts her a stare and she is silenced.
DIDO begins collecting giant hardbacks, exasperated.
                    LORD MANSFIELD
          Upon her husband's death a widow
          may receive....
                    JOHN
          ...her marriage portion and
          inheritance at once. She has forty
          days to leave her husband's home...

          Hummm...
              (contemplation)
          Yours are grand ambitions.

JOHN says nothing - swallows hard. DIDO steals a glance.
                    LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
          What is the purpose of the law in
          your eyes, Mr Davinier?
                    JOHN
          To... to provide certainty where
          there might otherwise be none.
                     LORD MANSFIELD
          Example.
                    JOHN
          The Zong ship and those drowned.

LORD MANSFIELD stiffens. He looks uncomfortably at DIDO
piling books. JOHN'S eyes follow.
                    LORD MANSFIELD
          It is one of the few trades
          acceptable to a gentleman.

                    JOHN
          I am no member of the nobility -
          I have little, but...where my
          father relies on the bible, I...I
          wish to rely on the law courts.
                    LORD MANSFIELD
          You aspire to the judiciary?

LORD MANSFIELD laughs at him. DIDO stares at the ground -
cringing on JOHN'S behalf. John asserts himself.
                    JOHN
          One day...yes...m'lord. I wish to
          make the laws not only administer
          them - for that...that is how I may
          truly change this world. I mean to
          say, make it... a better place.

                         LORD MANSFIELD
               Noble if not pompous! A country
               lawyer, you may make - perhaps! If
               you pay every regard to what you
               are taught - but you have neither
               the rank nor finances for any more!

                         JOHN
               Well...as a fourth son, you had
               rank but not the income to pay for
               your qualification to the Inns.

     DIDO's wide eyes take in JOHN, astonished by his chuzpah.
                         JOHN (CONT'D)
               Without the sponsorship of Lord
               Foley and William Hamilton...the
               English courts may not have
               benefited from your brilliance -
               and the title, Lord Chief Justice
               could not be yours today...M'lord.

               You believe you are worthy of
               such considerations? Such are
               your capabilities?

                         JOHN

               have not yet been afforded those
               considerations...but I know a
               country life does not suit me.

     LORD MANSFIELD's gaze is trained on JOHN. DIDO has finished
     gathering the books and is quietly slipping from the room.
                          LORD MANSFIELD
               The Reverend has requested I take

     DIDO moves along the hallway, lined with enormous artists'         *
     interpretations, communicating a certain lifestyle.

She slows, caught by one of the paintings - an English rose
stares out, as a black domestic submissively fastens a
priceless bracelet around her lady-master's wrist.
DIDO's POV: CLOSE on the domestic. Suddenly...
                    JOHN
          Thank you for your gracious
          support.

DIDO jumps - finds JOHN standing beside her.
                    DIDO
          I neither spoke for or against
          you - since neither is my place.

Elizabeth approaches, calls out, as she curtseys.

          your sex at Kenwood this week,

DIDO flushes.

                    JOHN
          Hopefully we have not disappointed!
                    ELIZABETH

She raises a minxish eyebrow and moves off. Awkward silence.

          importance of the Zong... why is
          the case before Papaa's court,
          the supreme court...?
He searches her, taken aback.   Why is she asking him?

          Well...

          It is a cargo ship.

          A human-cargo ship.
DIDO hesitates, tentative.

                    DIDO
          Oh. You said those who were
          drowned.

                    JOHN
          It lost most of its slaves before
          arriving at its destination.

          Drowned - by the crew on the
          captain's order.

JOHN watches as DIDO falters.

                       DIDO
          But...why?

The SOUND of the MANSFIELDS gathering with the ASHFORDS. A
maid approaches hurrying about her duties.

                    MAID
          Miss, your supper is served
          now in the ladies' parlour.

                       DIDO
          Thank you.
JOHN hesitates, struck with confusion at the maid's words.
DIDO becomes awkward. LADY MANSFIELD emerges, disappearing
into the dining room.
                    LADY MANSFIELD
          Mr Davinier, will you be joining
          us for dinner?
JOHN's eyes dart to DIDO - sees her unease. It pierces him.
                                                                  29.

               am promised to the company of my
               aunt this evening. She has recently
               moved to the cottage at Belsize.

               Of course - as you wish.

     She moves off, and DIDO and JOHN are left in tense silence.

               Permit me to ask, why you do not
               dine with your family - ever?
                         DIDO
               That is not correct.

               Forgive me...but twice now I have
               seen...I have seen you separated
               from the gathering.
     DIDO's cheeks begin to burn.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
               I am confounded.
     DIDO snaps, her shame over-spilling...
                         DIDO
               And well you might be - when the
               son of clergy is permitted to the
               table before a lady of the house.

               Is that a reminder of my place,
               Miss Lindsay?
     She holds back frustrated tears, pained.

                         DIDO
               No. It's a statement of mine!

     Both of them are smarting. JOHN moves off, stung.

     DIDO steps into the room, expressionless. She sits on the
     chaise longue, allows her gaze to settle on her reflection.

     Something terrible resonates through her - some awful
     thought or feeling, that leaves her breathless with
     emotion. And then her fingers come up to the skin on her
     chest...and she begins to pinch and pull with self-hatred,
     rubbing the heel of her palm across her cheek, her
     forehead, as her face crumples and she begins to cry.

     New day. LORD MANSFIELD and JOHN ride through Kenwood's

               There is much speculation on your
               decision. Anticipation seems to
               be turning to panic, m'lord.

               One hundred and thirty two drowned
               on route from Africa to the West
               Indies. Your ruling could bring
               the slave trade to its knees -
               entirely destroy an economic
               foundation of these lands.

               Is that pressure not maddening,
               m'lord?
     LORD MANSFIELD reigns in his horse. He quotes in Latin.

               The insurance claim states, the
               slaves were thrown overboard for
               the safety of the ship - that
               there wasn't sufficient water for
               the cargo and crew to survive the
               rest of the voyage.
                          LORD MANSFIELD
               It does.

                         JOHN

               truly `necessary' in order to save
               the ship - as the captain contends.

     A difficult silence.   JOHN is careful, but sceptical.
                         JOHN
               But...is that where it hinges?

     LORD MANSFIELD does not welcome the challenge.
                         LORD MANSFIELD
               The ship's journey was thwarted
               by impossible weather conditions -
               what should have been weeks
               became months! What once appeared
               enough water, may not have been!

                         LORD MANSFIELD
               Then do you know what a hundred
               thirsty slaves are capable of? I
               can tell you no man happily
               disposes of his cargo, even in
               the face of rebellion!
                   (Off John's silence)

               dock at port with barely a piece
               of merchandise left to trade -
               what would you do?   Swallow
               financial ruin - or claim your
               due from the insurers.
     John is conflicted - to speak up, or not?

                         JOHN
               With due respect... I should
               question, whether 'human' life
               should have been insurable as
               cargo - at all.

               Congratulations! I learned of
               your..your match..yesterday.                            *

               Thank you.
     He falters slightly, swallows hard - not all is well.
                                                             34.


Her eyes hone in on a pamphlet under his arm. JOHN shifts
uneasy at what it shows - the last few letters of THE ZONG
can be seen, and LORD MANSFIELD depicted with large butt.
                    DIDO
          I appear the only one to have
          just learned of this affair?

                    JOHN
          Perhaps yours is a life less
          concerned with such matters.
                    DIDO
          Why do you judge me so?
He studies her. She is tentative.

                    DIDO (CONT'D)
          It is a fact that I have
          contemplated on the matter for
          many hours, and I...I do not
          think the slaves could have been
          drowned in the way you say.

ON his disbelief - irritation slowly turns to dawning.

                    JOHN
          Are you at utter disconnect from
          everything?!
He searches her, making her feel very small and ashamed. As
he moves off, she stares after him, distressed.

                    DIDO
          Mr Davinier...please. Tell me.
          Tell me what you know!

He stops, stares back at her.   What to do?
                    DIDO (CONT'D)
              (earnest)
          Do not render me your amusement.
He traces her vulnerability. It roots him.

                    JOHN
          I can only tell you what I believe.

                    DIDO
              (trying to understand)
          And what...what is that?

                    JOHN
          The slaves were intentionally
          drowned, that is not in question.
          Chained! Thrown into the waters -
          chained together as one.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
               They were diseased - worth more as
               dead insured merchandise, than as
               alive spoiled goods.
                   (stark)
               The captain hoped it would `pay'
               to kill them.
     ON DIDO as colour drains from her face.   Nausea rises...

     His eyes try to read hers, becoming sensitive. As he moves
     back towards her. She struggles to take it in.
                         JOHN (CONT'D)
               Miss Lindsay....?
                         DIDO
               But the insurers are appealing.

                         JOHN
               Yes. They are challenging the
               decision of the lower court -
               refusing to pay for murdered
               slaves.

     Her eyes sting. JOHN can see she is having difficulty - he
     touches her hand absentmindedly, startling her, but their
     eyes remain locked. She attempts, weakly, to return self-
     possession. Then almost a whisper...

                            DIDO
               Thank you.

     That is, thank you for telling me what nobody else has!

     She turns, walks away.    ON DIDO, as her pace quickens.

     ON DIDO, urgently rifling through files, shelves - chaotic.
     She moves to a desk, pulls open drawers - REVEAL volumes
     and volumes of news pamphlets. A set of them bound, LORD
     MANSFIELD'S wax seal hanging from the cord. She unties the
     cord, wax seal all over her hands. She fingers her way
     through the pile - legal headlines...all referring to Lord
     Mansfield. She stops dead...

     POV - pamphlet cover...image of LORD MANSFIELD, drooping
     bottom lip touching the ground - foolish and dithering,
     whilst beside him a `Negro' slave wields a judge's' gavel.

     A headline - `Slave Cargo Deliberately Drowned to save ship

     She runs her fingers across the caricature, pained - then
     moves urgently to the next pamphlet, and the next...
     More MANSFIELD caricatures - a big nose, fat lips, all with
     Zong headlines:'Mansfield to Rule on "Disposable Slaves" `
     The library door suddenly opens, jolting DIDO.

                         ELIZABETH
               There you are!
     DIDO is frozen, says nothing. ELIZABETH stares from the
     doorway - why does DIDO look so strange?

                          LADY MARY
               Love?

     The two girls are startled. LADY MARY smiles to herself.
                         DIDO
                   (whispers)
               Bette, you could feel no such
               sentiment for you should either
               end poor or... broken hearted.

     The carriage rounds a corner, weaves through the bustle of
     markets, peasants, guided by HARRY, the MANSFIELD driver.

     ON DIDO's face, staring from the moving carriage.
                                                                42.

     Bloomsbury Square opens before us. As the carriage halts...

                         ELIZABETH (O.C)
               Aren't you quietly relieved?

                           DIDO
               Relieved?

                         ELIZABETH
               That you shan't be at the caprice
               of some silly Sir and his fortune!
                   (off Dido's silence)
               The rest of us haven't the choice!
               Not a chance of inheritance if
               we have brothers and forbidden
               from any activity that allows us to

     ELIZABETH sighs.

56   INT./EXT. BLOOMSBURY SQUARE ENTRANCE HALL - DAY. 9         56    *
     LIBBY, the housekeeper and THOMAS, the butler stand on
     ceremony. Maids help the Mansfield ladies as they disrobe.
     ON DIDO as her gaze falls on MABEL (20), a black maid
     helping ELIZABETH with her hat. A beat as DIDO stiffens.

                         LADY MANSFIELD
               Light the fires for dinner, will
               you, Thomas.
     ON MABEL as she catches DIDO'S stare, forcing DIDO to avert
     her gaze quickly, turning her back to distance herself.


57   INT. BLOOMSBURY SQ. DIDO AND ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.9 57     *

     The soft light of oil lamps.

     DIDO, in night-clothes, drags a brush through tight
     ringlets. She stops, observes, a moment as ELIZABETH runs a
     comb through her own silken hair.
                         DIDO
               You are so beautiful, Bette.
               I hope your match is the most
               wonderful of all gentlemen.
                                                                 43.


     ON ELIZABETH wide eyed, then moved as her eyes brim.

     A tentative knock and MABEL enters - DIDO becomes tense.
     MABEL speaks gently - strong Welsh accent.

                         MABEL
               Some bed socks for you, Miss
               Murray, Miss Lindsay. It's not as
               warm as we hoped tonight

     She hands a pair each to the girls.
                         ELIZABETH,
               Thank you Mabel...How kind.
     MABEL pauses as DIDO struggles with her hair.

                         MABEL
               Can I help you with that, Miss
               Lindsay?

     ON DIDO, self-conscious under MABEL'S stare.
                         DIDO
               Mabel, I am fine - thank you!

     She struggles once again, wrenching the brush.
                         MABEL
               You must start from the ends, miss.
     DIDO stares at her - a long beat.

                                                      CUT TO:
     Candle lit faces... DIDO's reflection in the mirror - her
     hair separated into four sections.
     In the reflection BG, ELIZABETH sits serenely watching
     MABEL brushing through each section from ends to roots.

                         MABEL (CONT'D)
               My Mam taught me, see?
     DIDO stares at her a moment, some kind of pain resonates in
     her eyes as her face softens and she begins to relax.

     The four MANSFIELD ladies step from the carriage. Before
     them, a huge Georgian home. All four take it in.

                         LADY MANSFIELD
               Promise me you will change that
               vulgar teal paint, if you ever
               become lady of this home. It is
               positively wanting, Elizabeth.
                                                                 44.


59   EXT. MAYFAIR. ASHFORD HOME. GARDENS. DAY.10                 59    *

     A sophisticated landscape, very much in keeping with LADY
     ASHFORD'S sense of style.
     A maid steps out - LADY MANSFIELD follows with the four
     Mansfield women. ELIZABETH beams.
                         MAID
               Lady Mansfield, LADY MARY and
               their nieces, Madam.

     LADY ASHFORD moves towards them, face bright with ambition.
                          LADY ASHFORD
               Ladies.
                         LADY MANSFIELD
               Lady Ashford.

     The girls curtsey.
                         LADY MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
               And the gentlemen? Mr James?
                         LADY ASHFORD
                   (reassuring)
               Here, of course. Very little could
               have prevented him, knowing that
               Miss Murray would visit today.

     ELIZABETH could burst. She looks up to see JAMES and
     OLIVER approach from the North side of the gardens.

                                                     CUT TO:

     The ladies sip drinks as LORD ASHFORD appears from the
     house, a man with presence (50s) cultivated and astute.

     He moves to OLIVER, observing DIDO, under a nearby tree.
                         LORD ASHFORD
               Lord Mansfield's infamous Mulatto.
               No wonder our `Lord Chief Justice
               knows not whether he is coming or
               going! Not your usual game, Oliver.

     OLIVER examines his father.
                         LORD ASHFORD (CONT'D)
               She can not know your thoughts
               unless you offer them to her.
     He moves off, leaving OLIVER pensive.
                                                             45.


                    LORD ASHFORD (CONT'D)
          The ladies Mansfield! As sweet on
          the eye as the freshest flowers
          in bloom....
              (off Lady M's laughter)
          What is in those glasses?
ON OLIVER as he moves to the pond. In the BG...

                    LADY ASHFORD
          Grenadine syrup...
                       LADY MARY
          And port!!
                    LADY MANSFIELD
          Which has gone to my head already!

ELIZABETH is knelt at the pond's edge with JAMES - a paper
boat floats on the water, toppling over to a unanimous cry.

OLIVER watches as DIDO approaches. His eyes light up.
                    ELIZABETH
          Oh Dido look - Mr James has made
          me a boat and it has capsized.
JAMES stretches a branch into the lake to rescue the boat.

                    DIDO
          What a dreadful shame.

OLIVER collects paper from the grass. CLOSE on his hands as
he folds it into a boat under DIDO'S nose.
                    OLIVER
              (to DIDO, earnest)
          For you.
She smiles, can't help being charmed.

                       DIDO
          Thank you.
He places it in the water, stands and examines DIDO. From
afar, LADY MANSFIELD watches.
                    OLIVER
          Miss Lindsay, would you do me the
          honour of taking some air with
          me, some time?
DIDO is dumbstruck - what to say? JAMES is halted.
                    JAMES
          Don't you care what people will say
                                                                46.


     DIDO is jolted by the antangonism in JAMES' tone -
     ELIZABETH too - it pierces her and she speaks up.
                         ELIZABETH
               What is that to mean Mr James?
               What should anyone say?!
     JAMES hesitates, then...

                         JAMES
               That he should compromise a
               lady's reputation by stepping out
               with her - scarcely having made
               her acquaintance!
                         OLIVER
               I think you are a great deal too
               anxious, brother. We should merely
               take a turn around Vauxhall.
     DIDO observes JAMES - His protestation is bitter. She
     traces OLIVER'S features, warmly.
                         DIDO
               I should be delighted, Mr Oliver!
               Most delighted.

     On the move through London streets. LADIES MANSFIELD and
     MARY sit quietly. ELIZABETH whispers to DIDO.
                         ELIZABETH
               Are you really to defy Papaa?

     DIDO says nothing, turns to stare out of the window.

     Teaming with parasols, fountains, and hidden pathways.
     61.1: JAMES and ELIZABETH stroll, followed by DIDO and
     OLIVER, then, LADIES MANSFIELD, MARY, and ASHFORD.

                          LADY MANSFIELD
                   (re. Dido with Oliver)
               I am not at ease with this.
               Lord Mansfield would be most
               aggrieved.
                         LADY ASHFORD
               Oh it can do no harm. This is
               simply two families, enjoying a
               day together.
     LADY MANSFIELD takes an unhappy breath, burdened.
                                                           47.


                    LADY ASHFORD (CONT'D)
          Though surely...IF a desirable
          match were a ... certain...
          possibility your dear husband could
          have no objections, could he?
LADY MANSFIELD, turns slowly to regard LADY ASHFORD,
aroused by the insinuation and alarmed at the same time.
She looks back to DIDO and OLIVER, wide eyed.

                    OLIVER
          Well I did not think I would ever
          find a lady who was not to be
          conquered or ignored...Until you.
                    DIDO
          Ah now how do I know this is not
          just another tactic in your
          battle to conquer?
He stops, takes her hand and places it on in his chest.

                    OLIVER
          See how my heart beats.

She lets her hand rest a moment.

                    OLIVER (CONT'D)
          I am utterly taken with you, Miss
          Lindsay.
                    DIDO
          Despite...such pronounced
          protestations from your brother?

                     OLIVER
          He cannot overlook your mother's
          origins, as I do. Foolish. Why
          should anyone even pay her regard
          when your better half has equipped
          you so well with loveliness and
          privilege.

Dido is stung. OLIVER shrugs, oblivious. The sound of Handel
filters from a nearby concert. DIDO tries hard to recover.

                    DIDO
          What a lovely sound.

He smiles at her, studies her...mischievous...

                    OLIVER
          You are unrelentingly cultured.
          Come, let's find it!
He takes her waist spinning her round with him into another
pathway, disappearing from the others, giggling as they go.
                                                           48.


                    LADY MANSFIELD
          People will think she has no family!
                    LADY ASHFORD.
          People will think they are courting!
LADY MANSFIELD and LADY MARY exchange a look. LADY MARY is
somehow softened - her eyes appeal to LADY MANSFIELD...

                    LADY MARY
          Let her enjoy his society.
LADY MANSFIELD is effected - reads MARY'S emotion.
61.2: An open pavilion with classical concert. ON OLIVER
and DIDO watching.

                    OLIVER
          I might only have dreamed of
          these moments, at one time.

DIDO smiles - allows herself to be flattered.
                    DIDO
          Really? You are much of the
          conqueror Mr Oliver.
He chuckles, brings his hand up to brush her cheek, gently.
She smiles just as her eyes fall on the back of a gentleman's
head, shoulders - his movement somehow familiar.
The sight roots her, uncertain of what she sees. And then
he turns to address another, and his profile becomes clear.

It is JOHN DAVINIER.
In that moment, he flicks his head round and his gaze falls
on her - a beat between them then his eyes fall on OLIVER.
JOHN excuses himself from others and makes his way across.

                    JOHN

          A clergyman!
              (an `off' smile)
          Good day, to you...sir.

OLIVER bows, manfully, asserting his greater status.
                    JOHN
          Sir. (beat) My regards to
          your family, Miss Lindsay.
Unexpected hope fills her.

                    DIDO
          Elizabeth and Mamaa are here...
          in fact.

DIDO watches as JOHN nods politely and moves off, returning
to his company - male and all of a similar type to him.

ON OLIVER, as he takes in JOHN'S effect on DIDO.

                                                   CUT TO:
61.3. The spit and bang of spectacular fireworks. OLIVER
stands engrossed as the sky lights up. DIDO looks up at
him. She wavers. Then...slowly she backs away from the crowd

61.4 DIDO walks quickly - follows the sound of the concert
to find her way back to JOHN.

Her POV: JOHN listening diligently to the music. He double
takes at the sight of her hovering at the edge of the
concert. He stands alarmed, negotiates his way to her.

                    JOHN
              (dismayed)
          Miss Lindsay, you are alone!!

                    DIDO
          I did not have the chance to see
          you before you left...Mr Davinier
          ...to convey my apologies.

                    JOHN
          Apologies...?

                    DIDO
          Your pupilage. Father would
          never have ended it...you...you
          never would have had to leave
          Kenwood were it not...
                                                             50.


His eyes soften as he looks at her...

                    JOHN
          He would make mine a living hell,
          were he to know of us speaking.
DIDO tugs him into a quiet lane, away from the concert and

Hardly a breath and BAM!! She is slammed against a walled
maze, suddenly!! JOHN pressed against her tightly!
Confused, her gaze darts around her, finds LADY MANSFIELD
and LADY ASHFORD ambling past along a cross path, oblivious.
DIDO freezes - held tightly against JOHN. She stares
panicked into his eyes and he into hers.

61.5:CUTAWAY So they do not see ELIZABETH as she strolls by
with JAMES - Her gaze falling on JOHN and DIDO, instantly.

ELIZABETH is stunned!!!! But doesn't falter.
61.4 CONT'D: As DIDO and JOHN look back - nothing but
anonymous strangers, leaving them none the wiser to being
discovered. JOHN pulls away, embarrassed...
                    JOHN (CONT'D)
          Forgive me.
She nods, equally bashful. They regard each other.

          What are you doing here in London
          Mr Davinier?
                    JOHN
          I am under a third cousin - a
          solicitor, here. Nothing more
          than petty disputes between
          unsavoury landlords and debauched
          tenants, but I cannot discount it.
                    DIDO
          Not what you wished for.
                    JOHN
          I haven't given up on The Inns.
          Nothing worth having in life
          comes easily.

          Where are my manners? I trust
          the future Mrs Davinier is well.

          Very well...thank you.

DIDO is unexpectedly struck - recovers herself.

                    DIDO
          I have tried to keep up - with
          the Zong. These past weeks.
                    JOHN
              (agitated)
          Tis pitiful! Such inability to
          simply know what value to put on
          another's life.
                    DIDO
              (bitterly)
          What price, a worthless Negro.

                    JOHN
              (frustrated)
          You utterly misunderstand me.
          I am saying that no man may have
          the value of that of cargo!!!
          Human beings cannot be priced,
          since we are priceless!! Freemen
          and slaves alike!
Her eyes begin to sting at the `integrity' in his words.
                    JOHN (CONT'D)
              (enthused)
          I am with others here. We are
          all students in law - applying
          pressure on the insurance companies
          to refuse from here on to insure
          slaves on any ship. A simple clause.
                    DIDO
          But that would require a change
          of law. I know nothing but...

                    JOHN
          A change in law - something the
          insurance companies can lobby for
          IF they can be persuaded to band
          together.
              (softly,)
          We may only be students,

          Someone has to have the courage.
          How can we expect to be civilised
          if we live in a barbaric world.
His words wind her as JOHN shakes his head, frustrated. She
takes him in - he is so very handsome!
                                                             52.


                    JOHN (CONT'D)
          It is the utter injustice...the
          industrial slaughter of so many.
DIDO stares at him earnestly.
                    DIDO
          No. It is more than that. It's
          the shame of a law that would
          uphold a financial transaction
          upon that atrocity.
She is scathing and accepting all at once, affecting him.
                    JOHN
          That is indeed the truth.

Their eyes are locked. An intimate beat that perturbs her.
                    DIDO
          I have never heard anyone speak
          like you.
                    JOHN
          Nor I, you, Miss Lindsay.

He is emotional, it perturbs him too, now.
                    JOHN (CONT'D)
          You must return. They will be
          anxious. Should I follow to see
          you safely.

                    DIDO
          No we cannot risk it.
He nods - studies her....
                    JOHN
          Good bye, Miss Lindsay.
              (he pauses)
          I suspect, we will never see each
          other again.
The thought strikes DIDO, uneasily.
                    DIDO
          Good bye, Mr Davinier.

She turns, preparing herself.

He trails off awkwardly. She falters.

          Quite.

A beat as they regard each other - then she moves off.

searching hard for OLIVER or the others. Her pace quickens as
a hand comes down on her shoulder, taking her breath away.

          I did not dare return to Lady

          I..I am terribly sorry. I thought
          I saw the others, I went after

OLIVER studies her - she is so nervous...what is she
hiding? A moment - then his eyes become forgiving.

ELIZABETH and JAMES approach, sit on the bench opposite.

Satisfaction washes over her. As DIDO and OLIVER appear, LADY     *

          She will need a gentleman who
          can temper her. Quite a task.

She fixes on LADY MANSFIELD, lets her eyes do the talking...
LADY MANSFIELD exchanges a look with LADY MARY.

               Your situation can attract so
               much better, James. She brings

               Spit it out.
                         LORD ASHFORD
               Her introduction to society comes
               at a key time in the insurance
               appeal. Parliament is nervous that
               your `family situation' will
               colour your judgement.
                         LORD MANSFIELD
               I will neither be pressured from
               the inside - or the outside.
     LORD ASHFORD comes to a stop.

               You are the highest judge in the

                    LORD ASHFORD (CONT'D)
          In you, they see a man who is of
          the persuasion and position to
          bring down the major trade of our
          time and the commercial health of
          this country. Some will say, next
          to our king, you are the most
          powerful man in England. And the
          same will ask how you, our Chief
          Justice can be fair?

                    LORD MANSFIELD
          How? RULES are in place to
          dictate how we live - were that
          not the case, I would not have
          had the mandate to give shelter
          to my nephew's child.

He struggles with his emotion.
                    LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
          She is his blood - MINE! And
          rightfully had entitlement to
          grow up on the family estate.
              (aggrieved)
          The parliamentarians may challenge
          me - let them! I can tell you all,
          if the law supports the Zong's
          slave owners as strongly as Murray
          blood runs through Dido Belle's
          veins - make no mistake - the
          insurers will be forced to pay up!

LORD ASHFORD is affected. He regards LORD MANSFIELD.

                    LORD ASHFORD
              (softly)
          I believe you.
He raises an eyebrow. Then...

                    LORD ASHFORD (CONT'D)
          I have reason to speak with you
          on another matter.
                    LORD MANSFIELD
          Oh?
                    LORD ASHFORD
              (tentative)
          I have a wish to seal the bond
          between the Ashford and Mansfield
          names. It would, however, require
          some relaxing of your most
          stringent rules, I must add!
LORD MANSFIELD comes to a halt again.

               I have had reason to speak with
               Lord Ashford.

               Are we in agreement?

                         LORD MANSFIELD
               We are.
                   (long beat)
               You once asked me, who would
               look after her when we are gone.
               Money is no substitute for a
               man's protection. I cannot deny
               her a match so suitable.

     LADY MANSFIELD nods, satisfied.

                         LADY MARY
               He never married. Cousin Marjorie
               wrote me last year, that he had
               died after a long illness.

     She looks down and continues to sew. DIDO fights tears,
     unexpectedly affected. ELIZABETH takes her Aunt's hand.

               You need worry about nothing.
               Your Papaa has been dealt with.
     She disappears, leaving DIDO lost. A nervous silence.

     a crack in the doorway.

               Mr Davinier.
     It makes him breathless just to see her there. A beat passes.

                         JOHN
               I didn't expect...! Are you to
               come inside?...Are...?
                         DIDO
               No...It would be dangerous.

                   (feeling foolish)
               Yes. Indeed.

               Oh Mr Davinier...I am so proud of
               you. I am so proud of what you
               are doing and...achieving.

                         JOHN
               No. We've achieved little....
     She lifts his face to hers, earnestly.

                         DIDO
               At least thirty per cent of
               insurers are with you! It is a
               start. It is a real start.

     They are staring straight into each other's eyes. She pulls
     her hands away, self consciously.
                                                             67.


                    DIDO (CONT'D)
          I have something to show you.
She collects the two scrolls beside her, each ribbon tied.
She hands one to JOHN, smoothing the other on her lap.
                    DIDO (CONT'D)
          It is said all of the ship's
          papers have been `lost'...
          but...here...I found these in
          Papaa's library.
                    JOHN
          What are they?
                    DIDO
          Papaa's notes on the ship's log.
          It seems the First Mate has come
          forward with it - one Mr Stubbs. I
          could not find the log itself, but
          look at Papaa's markings - See the
          map positions - From December
          29th, Captain Collingwood and
          his men directed the ship past no
          less than eight ports where, you
          see....
              (she points to map)
          ...there was every opportunity to
          stop and replenish the ship's
          water supplies.
JOHN studies the log and map together.

          Good Lord!
                    DIDO
          And they did not! They either
          ignored the possibilities, or
          they were never in need.

JOHN'S gaze darts from notes to the map, absorbed.
                    JOHN
          This...This is remarkable.
He looks up from the papers.   DIDO is still tentative.

                    DIDO
          Is it? Perhaps if you made these
          facts known, Mr Davinier
                     JOHN
          But this places you in an
          impossible position with Lord
          Mansfield.

     His face searches hers...

               Where is everybody, Mabel? The

     LORD MANSFIELD stares at her irritated - peculiar girl!
                         LORD MANSFIELD
               Well is she, or isn't she?
     MABEL wavers, attempts to sound convincing.

                         MABEL
               Yes. She is, M'lord.
     LORD MANSFIELD watches as she stiffly moves from the room.

sign swinging from the back of an inn. It shows a gent,
hat in hand, his black servant bowing behind him.

          Elizabeth said something when we

             Lady Mary in her responsibilities

             You...are above reducing yourself
             for the sake of rank.
She stares at him, frozen - his words bury somewhere deep.
She studies him, harder. He moves towards her, letting his
breath settle on her face. They are both deadly nervous.

ELIZABETH's mouth falls open....
                    MR VAUGHAN
          Miss Murray. Lady Mansfield.

ELIZABETH curtseys.
                    MR VAUGHAN (CONT'D)
          I trust your stay in London is
          proving pleasant, Miss Murray.

                    ELIZABETH
              (earnest)
          Oh most certainly.
                    MR VAUGHAN
          Miss Murray, I wonder, if you
          might permit me to call upon you
          at home, sometime?
                                                             75.


                    ELIZABETH
          Oh!
She looks to her mother, stunned, his gaze follows...

                    MR VAUGHAN
          With her Ladyship's permission?
                    LADY MANSFIELD
          I shall make arrangements.
ON DIDO, as OLIVER chats to others. She moves past as...

                    LADY ASHFORD
          A pity Lady Mansfield and I could not
          do business on James and Miss Murray.

                    LADY MARY
          A greater pity you rejected her.

                    LADY ASHFORD
          Let us not dwell on the
          unfortunate. Oliver and Miss
          Lindsay are a blissful match.
          Tell me, when exactly does she
          receive her inheritance?
As DIDO observes her reflection in waters - easy laughter
floats by - a group of gentleman josh.

A figure beside her turns - icy blue stare takes her in as
she meets his gaze and finds herself staring into the eyes
of JAMES ASHFORD.
                    JAMES ASHFORD.
          Miss Lindsay. Not Husband
          hunting, are we?
              (off Dido's disdain)
          Good Lord, I forgot - you have
          ensnared my brother. Now is he to
          share his dining room with you, as
          well as his bed??
His words bury deep and painful.

                    DIDO
          Oh, Mr James, your manners are as
          poor as your brother's finances.

                    JAMES
          And you are foolish enough to marry
          him. I on the other have no better
          use for your impoverished
          cousin!...(beat)...Though she does
          make for rather amusing sport!
                                                               76.


She follows his gaze through trees to ELIZABETH breathing
in the scent of the azaleas beside MR VAUGHAN. The joshing
gentlemen trickle away leaving only DIDO and JAMES.
She goes to move off. JAMES grabs her arm, spitefully.
                    DIDO
          That is painful, sir.
                    JAMES
          Have you never been manhandled?

                    DIDO
          It is not in my repertoire to
          keep company with beasts.

He regards her - her disdain reflected in his eyes. His
free hand comes up, fingers rest on her lips, then spread,
as he crushes her beauty in his hand.
Her eyes fill as he brings her close. So close. She is
afraid, angry. She struggles desperately, spirited, both
arousing and alarming him. As she tears herself from him

                    DIDO (CONT'D)
          How dare you? HOW DARE YOU!

He stares at her - takes her in, calmly. Then...
                       JAMES
          With ease.

DIDO wavers nauseous with contempt.   JAMES moves off.   She
watches, incensed, humiliated.

ELIZABETH strolls with MR VAUGHAN, as JAMES passes OLIVER,
he whispers to his brother.

                    JAMES (CONT'D)
          You will destroy us. You will destroy
          the entire order of our family.
Nearby, DIDO emerges from the trees...
                    LADY ASHFORD
          Oliver has been searching for you!

LADY MANSFIELD notes DIDO'S odd demeanour, LADY MARY too.
Her eyes dart suspiciously to JAMES as he approaches.
                    LADY MANSFIELD
          Are you unwell, my dear?
DIDO's affected eyes come up to meet her mother's. She goes
to answer...interrupted as...ELIZABETH gasps overwhelmed...

                    ELIZABETH
          Oh!..Mr James!
                                                                77.


     A distressed DIDO follows her gaze back to JAMES.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
               Lady Ashford, you had not mentioned
               Mr James was to attend!
                         LADY ASHFORD
               Surprisingly.

     LADY ASHFORD closes her eyes,livid. VAUGHAN stands usurped.
                         JAMES
               Ladies.
                   (off Dido's reaction)
               Miss Murray.

     He kisses ELIZABETH'S hand oh so gently, for DIDO'S
     benefit. LADY MANSFIELD's heart sinks.
     OFF DIDO, turbulent.

               I am not certain he is ready to
               go against the traders - they are
               some of the most powerful in
               these Isles - theirs are the
               finances that hold up England,
               after all. The enemies of any man

               I have heard nothing from him,

          your position for a man without

      LORD MANSFIELD before the painting, shielding it from us.
      ON ZOFFANY as his eyes fall on the window. LORD MANSFIELD
      follows his gaze, to DIDO alone in the gardens, reading.

      POV: THROUGH THE WINDOW, as DIDO feels their gaze. She
      falters. Her eyes dart through the glass, beyond LORD
      MANSFIELD, to the canvas....The sight causes her to stand -
      drawn to the window to see more clearly.
      The camera, too, draws in on the portrait, now. And as it
      is revealed to DIDO, so too, is it finally revealed to us.

      It is a serenely sensitive representation of two delicate
      English ladies - one part black, as they stand as equals,
      against Kenwood's iconic gardens.

      CLOSE on DIDO, shaken, taking in the extraordinary image.
      Off both men, each as moved as she is.

LORD MANSFIELD says nothing, observes her, curious.

          What are you reading?

                    DIDO
          Poetry. A gentleman named Thomas
          Day. He speaks of a slave who
          agreed to marry a free woman.
          A voice to people...people like
          my mother - who do not have one.

People like the drowned slaves. He takes her point.

                    LORD MANSFIELD
          You find yourself in such writing?

The camera tracks, capturing them taking in the canvas.
                     DIDO
          I don't know that I find myself
          anywhere. I have no place that I
          may claim.
                    LORD MANSFIELD
          What is it that you want, Dido?
          What precisely are you searching
          for? I enabled every rule of
          heritage so that you could know
          exactly where you belong. Yet
          little appears enough for you!
                    DIDO
          Papaa, you enabled every rule,
          but you had to overlook just as
          many to raise me within good
          society. And what if there were
          not a rule Papaa? What if that
          rule that allowed you to take me
          did not exist? Would you have
          returned me to the slums?
The air is poignant with the question.
                                                                   92.

                You are courageous. When it
                comes to the matters you believe
                in, society is inconsequential.
                You break EVERY rule when it
                matters enough. Papaa, I am the
                evidence.
                    (OFF the painting)
                This painting...is the evidence.

      with Lloyd's members - Insurance men, brokers, lawyers -
      all engaged in commerce and politics.

      ON LORD MANSFIELD with the LORD MAYOR. They weave past to
      sit with others, equally wigged - power houses of England,
      watched by all in the room. In every corner, heated debate
      rages - the imminent Zong decision on everyone's lips.

                          LORD MAYOR
                Look at them - For and against at
                each other's throats! How on earth
                did the damn quakers find their way
                into here!..(beat)..You are a brave
                man, negotiating these quarters on

                          LORD MANSFIELD
                You did not become Lord Mayor
                through being a coward.
                           LORD MAYOR
                Finally you are to speak, then.
                If England is destroyed we shall
                blame you!
      He slaps LORD MANSFIELD's back, playfully, but is deadly
      serious. LORD MANSFIELD is distracted...through the bustle
      in the room, the SOUND of YOUNG MEN debating at a table,
      insurance underwriters before them.

                have a duty?
      ON LORD MANSFIELD - his own group continue in conversation,
      but all his attention is on JOHN.
                          JOHN (CONT'D)
                Do the bench and parliament not
                have a duty to uphold and create
                the laws, to set the precedents
                that progress our morality, not
                retard it! If not to protect us
                from others, then to protect us
                from ourselves! Laws that allow
                us to diminish the humanity of
                anybody, are not laws - they are
                frameworks for crime.
      ON LORD MANSFIELD - something going on behind the eyes. The
      rest of the room fades - making JOHN clear and crisp.
                          JOHN (CONT'D)
                A constitution can never be finite
                - surely as humanity evolves so
                too must its laws. And frankly I
                really do not care if you as an
                individual are without character
                or conscience - But a land whose
                laws contain neither - whose laws
                sanction not control the barbarous
                among its citizens - that is a
                country whose hope is lost.

          concept of insuring `human' cargo.

LORD MANSFIELD climbs into his carriage.
                    LORD MANSFIELD
          That is correct!...(to his
          driver)...Drive!
The carriage begins to move off.   JOHN walks alongside it.

          Then know that when you are gone,
          your legacy will be to have left
          Miss Lindsay in a world that says
          she may be worth more dead, than
          alive.

          She is not a slave.

          By the very grace of God!

The words provoke LORD MANSFIELD. He stands, slamming his
hand to the driver's wall. The carriage halts abruptly.

JOHN stands at the carriage window, breathless. LORD
MANSFIELD looks down at him furious, suddenly disarmed by
the emotion in JOHN'S eyes.

                    LORD MANSFIELD
          This is not about Miss Lindsay.
JOHN is confused, flustered.
                    JOHN
          Of course it is! It's about all
          of us. It's about everything...

      LORD MANSFIELD searches JOHN, palpably affected now. He
      doesn't want to show JOHN his empathy, fights it - but for
      a split second it escapes in the profound silence.
      He recovers himself - considers his words before he speaks
      quietly - as though from personal experience...
                          LORD MANSFIELD
                Mr Davinier, the world is a
                devastating place. You must learn
                to protect your emotions if you
                are to prevent matters of both
                law..and love from devastating you.
      JOHN is frozen, averts his gaze. LORD MANSFIELD regards
      him, affected, bangs on the carriage again and is gone.

                to bear in this appeal. This is
                the question. That is, first:
                whether the slaves were drowned
                as an anticipatory act. An act to
                avoid the disease caused by their

                    LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
          Or secondly: whether they were
          `jettisoned' as cargo! To save
          captain and crew from certain death,
          when the extended journey threatened
          shortage of drinking-water.
              (steely eyed)
          Let me be clear, loss of water on a
          ship constitutes a singularly
          dangerous affair - insurrection of
          thirsty and hostile slaves at its
          extreme - and an impossible task to
          share diminished water reserve, among
          all those living, at best. Each
          implies severe threat to the lives of
          the seamen. In such circumstances our
          law is transparent and equivocal -
          the jettisoning of enslaved cargo
          ...IS legal!
              (he spells it out)
          And in these circumstances, combined
          with unavoidable loss of water, our
          laws leave the ship-owners securely
          within their rights to make a claim
          ...and behoves the insurers to pay
          losses.

          The ship's owners chose a tight
          `packing fashion' to transport
          the slaves...A popular fashion of
          transportation that is known for
          causing death and disease.

His voice is raised over the sounds of a chaotic court.

          This choice of laying the slaves
          tightly together is undertaken at
          the Captain's own risk. In the

          an avoidable lack of drinking water
          on board a protracted journey,

          simple `bad management' on a

                    LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
          Captain's part, and further, weigh
          as his own risk. An extended journey
          - one in which the destination is

          the captain's own mismanagement.
The noise lowers to silence. LORD MANSFIELD settles on JOHN.

                    LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
          It is not legal...to discharge lives
          from a ship into the waters, to
          prevent those lives dying on land,
          and to facilitate insurance
          compensation. Whether they be the
          lives of horses... or human beings
          ...slaves or otherwise - It is
          not legal, neither is it right.

DIDO lets out a gasp - breathless relief.
                    LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
          Further, the claim of shortage of
          water is illegitimate shown by the
          evidence put forward. To my
          mind, it is clear a fraud has been
          committed in claiming insurance on
          slaves who were...drowned solely
          for financial gain.
He looks around the room - sees LORD ASHFORD's acceptance.
His eyes fall on DIDO now and here they remain.
                    LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
          It is my opinion, that the state of
          slavery is so odious a position that
          nothing may support it. This case
          has displayed with searing clarity
          the depravity of any such nation
          whose choice is to practice it. You
          may be certain that I have laboured
          over my judgement and statements
          today and am in full understanding
          of all of the ramifications. Justice
          be done,though the heavens may fall.
JOHN'S eyes brim at the realisation of those words.

                    LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
          I find in favour of the insurers
          and overturn the decision of the
          lower court. I order a retrial.

Stunned confusion in the courtroom. Then, all kinds of
commotion - anger, cheers amid shock. LORD MANSFIELD stands.

                      CLERK
          All rise!
                                                                   99.


      JOHN jumps up, desperate for eye contact through the
      commotion...but LORD MANSFIELD fixes ahead, moves off.
      DIDO stands, caught by her own breath. JOHN turns to her.
      She begins to sob. For the first time he pulls her close,

      WIDE on the court room - JOHN holding DIDO as she sobs.
      Through the judges' exit - a figure, in the shadows. REVEAL
      LORD MANSFIELD, taking in DIDO and JOHN, affected.


124   EXT. WESTMINSTER HALL. STREETS - DAY.26                      124   *
      JOHN watches as DIDO races back to the carriage. ON their
      reaction - LORD MANSFIELD stands waiting.
      As DIDO and LORD MANSFIELD come before each other. Everything
      in their eyes - restrained emotion over a long beat.
                          DIDO
                You may not blame Mr Davinier
                ...My attendance today is
                absolutely at my own volition
                ...for matters which concern me.

                          LORD MANSFIELD
                I am fully aware, Dido.

      He fixes on JOHN. JOHN is apprehensive.
                          JOHN
                M'Lord...I am inspired by your
                decision today. We will not go
                backwards from here.
                          LORD MANSFIELD
                    (burdened)
                History will judge if your
                optimism is warranted...(beat)...
                You are a man of conviction.

      JOHN swallows hard, emotion rising, stinging his eyes.
                          JOHN
                I am trying to be.
                          LORD MANSFIELD
                Then your efforts are not in vain.

      DIDO moves to JOHN'S side, taking his hand. LORD
      MANSFIELD's eyes drop to their clasped fingers.

                          LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
                I have not changed my mind. She
                is to marry a gentleman.
      He turns and begins to move to the carriage.   JOHN stares
      at the ground, humiliated. DIDO is incensed.
                                                             100.


                    DIDO
          And Mr Davinier is not a gentleman?
Her voice rings out, furious. LORD MANSFIELD stops...

                    LORD MANSFIELD
          He is...indeed...Dido.
              (he speaks carefully)
          And that is why he ought to have
          a job befitting one.
                    DIDO
              (a whisper - defiant)
          My affections are with him, Papaa.
          I wish for nothing...
          nothing, if not to be his wife.

She stares into LORD MANSFIELD's eyes - he takes in JOHN.
                    LORD MANSFIELD
          If you would Mr Davinier, I would
          like you to attend my chambers in
          the morning. There are matters I
          would like you to assist me with.

                    JOHN
          Your Lordship?
                    LORD MANSFIELD
          And if you think it a good
          idea...I wish to facilitate
          your entry to the Inns of Court.

                    JOHN
              (tentative)
          That is to serve my qualification
          to The Bar?
The question LORD MANSFIELD once put to JOHN, is now answered.

                    LORD MANSFIELD
          Indeed...(humbled)...Capabilities
          such as yours are clearly
          deserving of such considerations.
JOHN breathes heavily, also humbled, as his tears surface.

                    JOHN
          I..I think it a very good idea, sir.

LORD MANSFIELD nods, then finally moves off.    JOHN can't
take it in. DIDO is breathless, eyes brim...
                    JOHN (CONT'D)
          Can it be true?
                                                            101.


                    DIDO
          Of course. He sees what I see.
          His words were as clear as...
                    JOHN
          No! That your feelings for me are
          so? That you would be my wife..?
              (off her reaction, )
          Because, I cannot conceive of a
          life without you...and if...if
          such were all that were before
          me, Miss Lindsay, then my heart
          would never beat the same again.
                    DIDO
          It is not. It is not all that is
          before you Mr Davinier...
          (begins sobbing) I love you...for
          all that you are, and with
          all..all that I am.

He breaks down now too, wiping her tears before kissing her
through his own sobs. Then tears turn to laughter.

We draw back on the couple - two fragile figures, amid the
bustle of London town.
ON the MANSFIELD crest as LORD MANSFIELD'S carriage moves
off, a solitary figure inside, staring straight ahead.
