          A BLACK SCREEN
          Onto which is written in white letters...

          "When business in the United States underwent a
          contraction... the Federal Reserve created more paper
          reserves.

          The excess credit spilled over into the market triggering a
          fantastic speculative boom... "



          EXT. CLINTON CORRECTIONAL FACILITY - DAY

          It's a summer day. The heat floats above the pavement.
          A cab waits in the lot.

          The large gates of New York's largest prison open and today's
          group of newly released emerge.

          They pass a guard who lifts up a copy of The USA Today to
          reveal the headlines and date that tells us it's 2002.
          Amongst this group we find a man carrying a small duffel.
          And we know this man. He is Gordon Gekko.

          But he is not as slick as we remember... he doesn't have that
          gleam in his eyes or that gel in his hair. No, this is a
          very different version of the man we remember... because now
          there's nothing behind those eyes... nothing we can read
          anyway.

          And he just stands there... coldly watching his recently
          freed brethren greet their wives and children... reuniting
          with the people who waited for them... the people who love
          them.

          The cab slowly pulls up and Gordon holds up a finger... wait
          a minute. He glares over to the entrance of the lot...
          waiting for his people... but they don't come.

          And the cab waits... Gordon stands there... in the heat...
          completely disappointed... and completely alone.
          And we...

          SLAM BACK INTO
          As the white letters reappear on the screen...
          "As a result... the American economy collapsed...
          Taken from an article about the pre-crash 1929...
          ... written by Alan Greenspan."

                          JACOB (V.O.)
           It's funny, the more we find ourselves
           slaves of chance... the more
           superstitious we become.

          A gorgeous June Friday.

                          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           And that would make Andrew Zabel one
           superstitious motherfucker.

          Find ANDREW ZABEL, mid 50s, shaved-head and in good shape.

                          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           He started every day the same exact
           way. He would walk his dogs then
           leave his Gramercy Park condo at seven
           am on the dot.

          As Andrew leaves 36 East Gramercy Park East, an impressive
          building made of white stone.
          Andrew wears a suit and holds an umbrella.

                          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           And he would take an umbrella with him
           even when there was no chance of
           rain...

          As Andrew heads to a newsstand and throws the INDIAN CLERK a
          familiar nod. And without saying a word, the clerk knows
          exactly what to give him.

                          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           He'd buy a journal, a tin of chocolate
           Altoids and a cold bottle of Poland
           Springs water.

          23RD ST SUBWAY STATION
          As Andrew bounds down the stairs and through the gate...

                          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           He had timed it out so he wouldn't
           have to wait more than three minutes
           for the uptown five train.

          As Andrew emerges out to the platform and sees the headlight
          from the 5 train coming down the tunnel.

                          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           I guess you could say that day was
           like every other...

          And as the train approaches... holding that Wall Street
          Journal... the bottle of water and that tin of Altoids...

                          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Except for one thing...

          ... Andrew Zabel simply steps forward and falls onto the
          track.

           3.

                         

                         
          And as the train SLAMS into US...

                         DARKNESS
          Which holds for an uncomfortably long moment, then...
          "Money Never Sleeps" graces the screen... and we move down
          below the letters to find...

                         A CHART
          Now filling the screen. It's of the Dow Jones Industrial
          Average. It's for the year 2008 and it's down to the
          right... not good.
          A circle marks Friday June 13th. Follow a blue line back
          three days and stop. Another circle is now formed and
          Matthew Good's "Giant" rings out...

                         MIDTOWN
          Opening titles... the workplace throng... listening to their
          iPods, checking their Blackberrys and sipping their
          Starbucks.

          Move with this throng, to the Matthew Good tune, under the
          opening titles, past 745 Seventh Avenue, the Lehman Brothers
          building... with that giant ticker that rounds the building
          posting Dow 12,579.76 -- +119.86

          And keep moving... all is normal in the financial center of
          the universe.

          Land on a impressive modern building made of glass and steel
          then climb up it to the top... to the penthouse office
          suites.

          An impressive office with a 180 degree view of southern

                          ZABEL
           Go ahead, open it.
          And across from Andrew Zabel sits JACOB L. MOORE... who holds
          his bonus check.

                          JACOB
           Really?
          On the wall over Zabel's shoulder runs an electronic ticker
          with the major indices and just one stock... ticker KZI...
          Keller Zabel Investments.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           with the credi--

                          ZABEL
           Screw the credit derivative desk, I
           don't understand half the shit they do
           anyway.
          Zabel forces a smile. But Jacob can tell something's wrong
          with him.

                          JACOB
           Are you okay?
          Zabel doesn't answer... he just nods to the envelope.

                          ZABEL
           Open it.
          He opens the envelope and looks down at the check.
          $1,450,000. And he can barely contain his excitement.

                          JACOB
           Thank you.
          And we get a good look at Jacob now... boyish features that
          display humility with a trace of mischievousness thrown in.
          He's definitely sexy, definitely cerebral and definitely
          winning.

                          ZABEL
           I'm proud of you, Jacob.
          And Jacob tries to play it cool as he looks up at the
          electronic ticker on the wall... 12,592.46 -- +132.46... KZI

          Two bedroom in a Murray Hill high rise. Jacob watches Fox

          massive mansions, expensive watches and wines.

           CODY WILLARD (ON TV) (CONT'D)
           Whether they're spraying $5000 a
           bottle champagne at Voile Rouge in
           Saint-Tropez, ordering a $10,000
           Martini at The Algonquian Hotel with a
           diamond on the bottom or eating a gold
           dusted $175 hamburger at the Wall
           Street Burger Shoppe...
          Now the flashes are of some of the top HEDGE FUND MANAGERS in
          the business that we'll see later... one of them is a man
          named BRETTON WOODS... maybe we hold a little longer on him

          She's in workout gear, wearing earbuds, obviously just off a
          run, caught off guard and thus flipping him the finger...
          it's adorable.

           crown... them's the rules.
          Audry grins in victory.
          Willy shakes his head, grabs a marker, scribbles something
          down on a post-it then places it on his forehead. It reads
          "I bought Toll Brothers at $24" and he has to wear it all
          week.

          Jacob glares over to the tv.

           GOVERNOR (FOOTAGE) (CONT'D)
           And once again, I will point to
           largely unregulated world of hedge
           funds... an ever-growing and
           increasing powerful area of the market
           that I repeatedly tried to regulate as
           Chairman of the SEC...
          And there's a loud knock on the door. Jacob ignores it.

           GOVERNOR (FOOTAGE) (CONT'D)
           And the collapse of this legendary New
           York financial institution is why I
           continue to fight that battle as
           Governor of this great state.
          Another knock... this time louder. Jacob mutes the tv.

                          JACOB
           What?
          From the door...

           You weren't answering your phone.

           It broke.
          Robby sharply nods.

           Dude...
          He stops short... swallows...

           What?

                          ROBBY
           I just found this out and it hasn't
           hit the press yet.
          Once again... he stops short and looks away in frustration.

                          JACOB
           What? Robby, what are you trying to
           say?

           Andrew Zabel threw himself in front of
           the subway this morning.
          Jacob just stands in that doorway. No reaction at all.
          Absolutely frozen.

          INT. JACOB'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

          Jacob now stands in the center of his apartment. Completely
          in shock. As he looks to the plasma... Fox Business on mute.
          Brian Sullivan reporting under the graphic KZI $19.34... -

          $37.28.
          He glares at it for a long moment, then... almost calmly
          picks up a chair and throws it into the tv... which shatters.
          And Jacob... not sure what to do. Until... he turns and
          sees... on the dresser... a gorgeous engagement ring sitting
          in an open box... a fuck you ring.

          EXT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY/CAMPUS - DAY

          As Jacob bounds the steps of the Business School and heads

          INT. COLUMBIA SCHOOL OF BUSINESS/URIS LECTURE HALL - DAY

          The lecture hall is packed with wall to wall students. Jacob
          stands at the back.
          A PROFESSOR is at the podium.

                          PROFESSOR
           Our speaker today has quite a
           checkered background in the world of
           finance.
          Some laughter from the room.

                          PROFESSOR (CONT'D)
           He graduated from City College in 1966
           and became a securities broker at
           Hudson River Bank then moved on to
           Smith Barney. In 1973 he went out on
           his own to establish a spectacular
           career as a independent trader then an
           active participant in the LBO craze of
           the 1980s.

                          (BEAT)
           In 1988, he was indicted for insider
           trading and then charged with other
           various forms of securities fraud and
           IRS violations. In one of the most
           harshest sentences ever given to a
           white collar criminal... he served
           fourteen years in a maximum security
           prison and he wants me to stress that
           it was not a country club.
          Again laughter from the floor.

                          PROFESSOR (CONT'D)
           Since his release in 2002, he has
           written and has spoken publicly about
           what he refers to as the current state
           of the world economy. He is not
           allowed to trade on the US exchanges.
           His new book "Moral Hazard! Why Wall
           Street Has Finally Gone Too Far."
           comes out in October.

                          (BEAT)
           Please welcome... Gordon Gekko!
          The room applauds... and out to the podium slowly walks...

                         GORDON GEKKO
          No swagger in his step... not in a suit... hair not slicked
          back... but still looks fucking good.
          As he waits for the applause to wind down... and even a
          little longer... surveying every corner of the large room...
          commanding its full attention... getting it... holding the
          silence... until finally... he leans into the mic and says...

           19.

                         

                         

                          GORDON GEKKO
           You're all pretty much fucked.
          The room breaks into laughter... Gordon smiles and waits for
          it to die down.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           What's not funny is what's happening
           out there. I don't think people get
           it. And I know the financial center
           of the world doesn't get it... which
           happens to be Washington DC now.
          As he takes to a pace...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           To understand where we are, we need to
           understand how we got here. No good
           deed goes unpunished, all fires start
           with a well meaning spark and we
           wanted Americans to be able to afford
           homes. Sounds nice enough... lets try
           to get the middle and lower classes
           into homes they can own. So we made
           money cheap and lowered restrictions
           on mortgage lending.
          As he takes a moment and looks over the room...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           Somebody reminded me the other night
           that I once said "greed is good." I
           swear I don't remember it but it
           sounds like something I would say in
           the Eighties.

                          (BEAT)
           And I was right then. Greed was good.
           America needed greed and risk-taking
           and leverage to get to become the
           superpower we are... or were. And
           capitalism needed greed and risk and
           leverage to become the economic
           platform it has become... but those
           same attributes that got us there are
           now the liabilities that threaten to
           destroy us.
          Jacob's blackberry vibrates and he checks it. He has a text.
          "KZI!!! -- wtf?"

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           So greed has been redefined. Who
           knows -- maybe it was always like this
           and like everything else in this
           world, it's good and it is evil.
          Taking a moment to survey the room...

           20.

                         

                         

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           Because people -- it's greed that
           caused someone who aspires to own a
           seven-hundred thousand dollar house
           they can't afford, to take on a loan
           they'll never be able to pay back...
           and it's greed that caused their
           mortgage lender to give them that loan
           then sell it right away... and it's
           greed that caused the buyer of that
           loan to slice it into a million little
           pieces then spit them all over the
           world... and it's greed that caused
           the rating agency to give that toxic
           loan a triple-A rating just because it
           was mixed in with some good loans...
           and it's greed that caused the
           insurance company to insure that loan.
          Jacob quickly glances down again at his blackberry and checks
          the quote, KZI $14.53.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           They were insuring the end of the
           world; "When the world explodes...
           just find us in the rubble and we'll
           be sure to pay your claim."
          Drawing in a deep breath...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           CMO's, CLO's, CBO's, CDO's, CDS's,
           SPE's, ABCP's,SIV's, REMIC's, CMBS's,
           toxic traunches, ninja loans, credit

                          (BEAT)
           Maybe I was in prison too long but I
           have no idea what half that shit
           means.
          The room laughs in agreement.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           And I'm considered a pretty smart guy
           when it comes to finance!
          And Jacob's blackberry vibrates again. This time he removes
          it from his pocket, doesn't check it and simply turns it off.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           And if I know our central bank --
           which I do -- I predict it's going to
           throw gasoline on this fire with more
           cheap money and federal bailouts and

           statistics on productivity and

          And Gordon stops pacing... takes a moment for effect.

          Then sums it all up with...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           So no good deed goes unpunished and
           all fires start with a well-meaning
           spark and when you take free money and
           no lending standards then add it with
           unaccountable risk and ungodly
           leverage and unbridled greed... what
           you end up with is cancer.
          And Gordon takes in a deep breath...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           Systemic, malignant and global.
          Now the room is completely silent.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           Do they still have the V&T restaurant
           on Amsterdam? Is that still there?
          A stunned girl in the front row shakes her head.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

           God, I loved their pizza.

          INT. URIS HALLWAY - DAY

          EXT. URIS HALL - EXACTLY 6 MINUTES LATER

          Gordon quickly walks out with his PUBLISHER, a woman in her
          40s and heads into the quad. Jacob immediately matches their
          stride.

                          JACOB
           Mr. Gekko, can I speak to you for a

           By the end of the day it might not

           I might not be allowed to trade, Jake,
           but I still love to watch from home.

                          JACOB
           Andrew Zabel took me under his wing
           when I was in high school. He
           basically got me my scholarship to
           Yale then hired me right out of
           business school.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Andrew's smart, he beats the

           He's dead.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           He killed himself this morning.
          As that registers...

           I'm sorry to hear that.

          And Jacob coldly shakes it off then sucks in a deep breath
          and looks into Gordon's eyes... genuine and lofty...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           I love your daughter very much and I
           would be honored if...
          And realizing what this is... Gordon starts to laugh... which
          throws Jacob off.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           ... you would bless-- I really don't
           understand what you find so funny.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           My daughter hasn't spoken to me for
           eleven years and you know it. She
           blames me for her brother's overdose
           and every other disaster that's fallen
           upon the world since the mid-nineties.

                          (BEAT)
           And by the way, isn't it strange that
           Winnie would date a guy from the
           street?

                          JACOB
           What?

                          GORDON GEKKO
           She hates me. And she hates Wall
           Street and everything it represents...
           so don't you find it curious that she
           would fall in love with you?
          And that slams into Jacob... who's frozen for a beat.
          Jacob finally snaps out of it then joins Gordon.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           So you want my blessing?

          A BUTLER lets Jacob in. Jacob takes in the massive space
          with an insane view of Central Park. He can hear a beautiful
          sonata playing in the next room.

                          JACOB
           I'm here to see Bretton Woods.
          The butler nods then leads Jacob through the full floor unit
          and into the...

                         PARLOR

           40.

                         

                         
          A huge chandelier hangs over the all marble room. A
          fireplace on one wall and a twelve foot wall of glass
          featuring that park view on the other.
          And Jacob realizes that sonata is live. He's walked into a
          recital of some sort.
          About twenty people sit watching a YOUNG GIRL play on a very
          unique looking silver grand piano.
          The girl can't be a day over thirteen. She's playing
          Mozart's "Ronda Alla Turca"... her fingers gliding across the
          keyboard in precision, her eyes closed in inspiration. It's
          as spectacular as it is moving.
          Jacob takes it in for a moment then looks over the room. All
          ethnicities and types...
          The AFRICAN LEADER in full tribal gear, the DISHEVELED ARTIST
          with his GAY NOVELIST LOVER, the NEW YORK KNICK with his
          MODEL WIFE, the MOVIE STAR with her TEENAGE SON.
          And BRETTON WOODS...
          Mid 40s, slicing jawline, deep set eyes, in great shape,
          refined, composed and masculine.
          He's the owner of this penthouse and he's looking right at
          Jacob. Jacob looks away.
          And the young girl finishes the last movement of the sonata
          to applause.
          The guests all stand, some go talk with the girl. Bretton
          heads over to Jacob.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           As you can see, I'm having a little
           dinner party here but I thought it was
           important we speak right away.
          He speaks with a British accent.. Jacob nods.
          Bretton looks over the room for a moment, scans his guests
          then back at Jacob...

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           Please... if you don't mind waiting in
           my office, I'll be in a minute.
          And the butler is already at Jacob's side, motioning him to
          follow him.

          INT. BRETTON WOODS'S OFFICE - NIGHT

          Jacob waits for Bretton. He looks over the place. The view
          of the park. The classic furniture.

          AND THE HUGE PAINTING ON THE WALL

           41.

          Jacob nods. Bretton just looks at him... making him nervous.

           Your daughter's an amazing piano

          moment.
          He's a hedge fund type, real SLICK, reminds us of Gekko

          No doubt about it, this is a nice place. Worth three million
          dollars, maybe four at the beginning of the year.
          Sparsely decorated. Large framed photographs line the walls.

          stands... taking in the large framed pictures on the wall.
          As Jacob checks out a framed chart for "Gouda Tulip Bulbs Dec
          1 1634 to Feb 5 1637." The chart goes straight up and to the

                          JACOB
           Fuck no.
          Jacob now finds himself looking at a political cartoon from
          the early 1900s.
          It's of two men rowing a boat in a lake of dollars. One of
          the men is Uncle Sam dressed in US flag colors. But Sam's
          very small in this cartoon... can't really row the boat.
          The other man is much bigger and clearly doing the heavy
          rowing. He is...

           stopped the Panic of 1907 by stepping
           in and buying up shares in all the
           companies that were crashing.
           Everyone else quickly followed like
           lemmings.
           (re political cartoon)
           See -- people had stopped looking to
           their government or trusted advisors.
           They looked to JP Morgan. It was all
           about simple psychology -- every crash
           should have a JP Morgan to step in and
           save it.
          As they walk the hardwood floor...

           See Jacob... the best opportunities
           are found where angels fear to tread.
          And they arrive at the next piece on the wall... a small
          framed bond.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           That's a bond issued by the Central

           McGregor made a fortune dealing these

          Finally, the SIX FOOT TALL RECEPTIONIST, leaves her desk...
          her heels clicking as she walks over.

          Jacob nods... holding a folder of his previous tax forms, his
          passport and other documents obviously needed for the job.
          And the elevator doors open... but not to an office...
          Jacob shields his eyes to the wash of daylight... then looks
          to realize that he's on the roof of the building.
          And in front of him is... An Augusta A109E Helicopter with
          "The Locust Fund" written on the side.

          Jacob emerges from the Augusta and looks across the tarmac to

          INT. JACOB'S SUITE/BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Now dressed in a tightly-fitting suit over a white shirt with
          wing collars and stove-pipe skinny trousers, Jacob stands in
          front of the mirror.
          As Jacob throws on a top hat and admires the 1928 version of
          himself....

          INT. THE LEFT BANK - NIGHT

          A Roaring 20's party is taking place... it's full-on
          speakeasy vibe. It's right out of 1928, only with Europeans,
          Russians and Middle-Easterners.
          Smoke fills the room. A jazz band roars. Drinks flow.
          As Jacob and Bretton head in...

                          BRETTON WOODS
           If he offers you a drink -- take it.
          And with that, Bretton points across the room where OLEG
          BAKUNIN sits.

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           If he offers you a line of coke --
           snort it.
          He's in his mid-40s, overweight, sweaty, draped in tight
          black Prada and smoking a cigarette.

           64.

                         

                         

           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
           If he offers you a child -- raise it.
          And it seems A MODEL BOMB has recently exploded at Oleg's
          table... leaving the skinny shards everywhere.
          Oleg sees them, stands and opens his arms.

                          OLEG
           Bretton Woods has arrived.
          Bretton smiles. They head over. Oleg turns to one of the
          MODEL GIRLS next to him.

                          OLEG (CONT'D)
           I want you to meet one of the only men
           in the world who might be as rich as I
           am. Wait a minute... Bretton what did
           oil close at today?

                          BRETTON WOODS
           A hundred and twenty-nine dollars a
           barrel.

                          OLEG
           (to Model Girl)
           Forget what I said -- I'm much richer
           than him.
          Oleg then looks at Jacob.

                          OLEG (CONT'D)
           Who the fuck is this?

                          JACOB
           Oleg, I'm Jacob Moore. It's nice to
           meet you.
          Oleg regards Jacob for a beat, then back to Bretton and asks
          again...

                          OLEG
           Who the fuck is this?
          Bretton smiles...

                          BRETTON WOODS
           Jacob has recently come over from KZI
           to work with me.
          And now Oleg turns to Jacob.

                          OLEG
           KZI? You worked with Andrew Zabel?
          Jacob takes a beat. Then...

                          JACOB
           That's right.

           65.

                         

                         

                          OLEG
           He was a legend.
          Jacob just nods, not showing any emotion. Oleg motions for
          the girls to make room and they all sit...

                          OLEG (CONT'D)
           It was that mortgage shit. He
           should've just focused on managing
           money and not fuck around with that
           crazy mortgage shit.
          Bretton just looks away. Jacob stays cool.

                          OLEG (CONT'D)
           It was a shame his fund was only for
           institutions... I would've liked to
           have invested.
          Oleg motions to a WAITRESS who immediately pours vintage
          champagne.

                          OLEG (CONT'D)
           In honor of the theme tonight, have a
           glass of 1927 Heidsiek champagne...
          Oleg hands Jacob a flute before he can decline.

                          OLEG (CONT'D)
           This is one of two hundred bottles
           discovered on a shipwreck off the
           coast of Finland... thirty grand a
           bottle.
          And Oleg aggressively puts his arm around Jacob, bringing him
          into a drunken half-bear hug and spilling most of the
          champagne out of Jacob's flute.

          EXT. DUBAI HARBOR - NIGHT

          Oleg and some of his crew lead Jacob, Bretton and three
          beautiful, giggling model girls down a trail to a secluded
          mooring.
          Fishing boats bob violently in the water -- and next to them
          is Oleg's Phoenix 1000, his personal, 65-meter SUBMARINE.
          As a boatman helps them all climb aboard:

                          OLEG
           Phoenix 1000.

          INT. SUBMARINE - NIGHT

          As they walk through the ornate deck saloon:
          Oleg beckons Jasper toward a huge panoramic window looking
          out at the city of Dubai.

           66.

                         

                         
          And then the view starts to MOVE. The surface of the water
          RISES before them, Dubai recedes and the submarine descends
          spectacularly into the depths.

          INT. THE DECK SALOON - NIGHT

          Lights illuminate the dark waters as curious fish flit past.
          Jacob, Bretton and Oleg are on divans, the girls undulating
          around them.

                          OLEG
           Bretton, I have... what?... two
           hundred million with you.

                          BRETTON WOODS
           And hopefully that's just a start.
           Oleg, there are so many opportunities
           out there right now I feel like a kid
           in the candy store.
          Oleg waves him off.

                          OLEG
           You know I like to spread it around...
           I'm like my own fund of funds. I
           don't like to have too much with one
           manager.
          As Oleg shakes cocaine out of an envelope...

                          OLEG (CONT'D)
           You never really know who to trust in
           this world.
          Jacob takes a beat, swallows nervously, then...

                          JACOB
           I couldn't agree more, Oleg. It's one
           of the first things that Andrew Zabel
           taught me. I worked very closely with
           him. It's why Bretton hired me. To
           get behind the Andrew Zabel curtain.
          Bretton flashes Jacob a look... "What the hell are you
          doing?" Jacob swallows back some nerves then continues...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           You said before that you always wanted
           to invest with Zabel but couldn't
           because he only handled institutional
           money. Well here's your chance.
           Zabel taught me everything he knew.
          Oleg looks up to Jacob from the line of coke with interest.

          He looks over to Bretton who still glares at Jacob...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           But I can give you a little bite...

           It involves building positions in high
           yielding stocks new to volatility then
           writing calls with split strike
           prices.
          And Oleg regards Jacob for a long moment, a jury determining
          the verdict... Jacob holding on to that sly smile... Bretton
          looking away... playing it cool.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           It's complicated but like Bretton said
           -- right now there are more
           opportunities than ever.

          Jacob sleeps. There's a knock on his door. He stirs. The
          knock's louder. Then... Jacob finally wakes, moves to the
          door and opens it to see...

          Bretton riding extremely fast with Jacob trying to keep up.

          race.
          Bretton pulls ahead but Jacob doesn't give up.
          As they move quickly toward a patch of forest with a only
          narrow trail entering it, Jacob focuses on the horizon and
          revs the bike into more speed. He pulls up next to Bretton
          as they approach the trail.
          If Jacob doesn't slow down, and fall in line behind Bretton,
          he's going to hit the trees. But he doesn't.
          Instead, Jacob blasts the bike into its final dose of speed,
          narrowly avoiding impact by zipping into the trail... pulling
          ahead of Bretton and taking the lead.

          As it sits still in the setting sun. Untouched by man.

           It's completely legal, Jacob. The
           funds reverted back to the pre-trust
           posture... that means the money was
           technically Gordon's again.
          Hadley just shrugs...

           He didn't trade.

                          JACOB
           He put the money into the hedge fund,
           that's considered capital investment.

                          HADLEY
           Jacob, Gordon never put the money into
           a hedge fund. He simply took control

           Well, Gordon had placed his Hudson
           River shares into the trust before he
           was convicted. You do know he started
           out there?
          A rental car parks out front of a small bank. Jacob emerges

           Okay, then the trust aggressively
           acquired more shares about two years
           ago... enough to have a controlling
           position in the bank.
          And Jacob stops walking when he sees... a group of angry
          depositors forming outside and a sign hanging in the
          doorway... "Closed."

           That's right. All of the trust's

                          JACOB
           Yup... sure beats the hell out of
           insider trading, doesn't it?
          And Winnie finds her keys and heads for the door...

                          WINNIE
           I can't hear anymore of this.
          ... but Jacob steps in front of her.

                          JACOB
           I'm done. I sold everything. The
           ring. Everything. I gave back the
           KZI bonus. I'm out and I'm broke and
           I deserve it.
          And she just looks at him...

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           But Winnie, the one thing I can't
           accept -- is losing you.
          And before she reacts...

          WERE BACK ON THE CHART
          As a circle forms on Nov 6th then travels quite a ways then
          finally stops. Unfortunately, this slope down the S&P
          trendline is quite pronounced.

          THE CABIN OF A BOEING 777
          As Jacob opens up a copy of Barron's... Gekko on the cover
          under the caption "What's His Next Move?"

          AND BRETTON WOODS
          In an official office of our Federal Reserve Bank, proudly
          signing the documents...

          AND ALONG THE BANKS OF THE PERSIAN GULF
          Dubai in the background. Jacob waits against a bench.

          Gekko.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Did you see Barrons?

                          JACOB
           You finally got the cover.
          Gordon nods.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           Everybody thinks you got rich of
           betting against the system. If they
           only knew...

                          GORDON GEKKO
           The powers that be will never let that

          Jacob's not arguing it...

                          JACOB
           How much is enough, Gordon?
          Gordon laughs with a shake of the head.

           candy, package them into unexplainable

           I'll always have America... it's why
           I'm here. I'm buying the island.

           I have a lot business abroad now.

           where the action is anymore.

                          JACOB
           What happened to the precious
           depreciating asset of time?

                          GORDON GEKKO
           It still trades...

           ... but I'm a billionaire now, Pal.

                          JACOB
           I'm out, Gordon, I'm done trading.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           I don't know why. You pulled it off,
           Kid, you took him down -- granted with
           my help -- but you atoned for Zabel's
           sins with Bretton's money.

           As I see it, you're just getting

                          JACOB
           Did you ever really want to reconcile
           with her?

          And Gordon... strongly holding Jacob's glare... simply
          replies...

                          GORDON GEKKO
           Same answer.

                          JACOB
           But it didn't work.
          Gordon sadly shrugs...

                          GORDON GEKKO
           I've been trying to wire two hundred
           million into her bank account but she
           won't accept it.

                          JACOB
           I know. She doesn't want it... we
           don't want it.

                          (BEAT)
           Because it's not about what you
           have... it's about what you do. And
           Gordon -- it's never about the money.
          Gordon shakes his head.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           That sounds good. I bet you can even
           wrap it in a pretty red bow. But
           Champ, it's idealistic... and idealism
           kills every trade.

                          (BEAT)
           Winnie will realize that at some
           point... and then we'll be fine.
          And Jacob finally looks away... in pity.

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           See Jacob -- the hustle we all fall
           for is actually thinking we can fight
           what's inherent, what's inevitable...
           that we can somehow undo what
           genetics, or God, or whatever name you
           wanna tag it, has placed deep inside
           of us. Because whether it's greed or
           revenge or the compulsion to chase...
           it all amounts to the same thing...
           loss of control. And it's always
           going to be there and it's always
           going to be stronger than you, Pal.

           mess.
          Joining Gordon's stride...

                          JACOB
           Winnie's pregnant.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           It's going to be a boy.

           What do you want?

                          JACOB
           It's bad out there, Gordon, people are
           panicked. They're not looking to
           their government. They're not looking
           to their trusted advisors. They're
           looking to you.

                          GORDON GEKKO
           You want me to buy?
          And Jacob Moore... slowly confirming...

                          JACOB
           Publicly and aggressively.
          Gordon just looks at him.

                          JACOB (CONT'D)
           But they're all lemmings. Simple
           psychology. You once said every crash
           should have a JP Morgan to step in and
           save it.

                          (BEAT)
           Well Gordon -- this is your chance to
           be JP Morgan.

           dead cat bounce.

           It'll buy us time. That's all I'm
           asking for... time.

           Full clemency.

           You can offer that?

           Your daughter can. She works with the
           new Secretary of Treasury now.

           Winnie. Me. Your grandson.
           Something money can't buy... a family.
