          Morning.

          Clouds moving through the sky.

          We see various shots of the city, exterior storefronts,
          people going about their lives and some wider shots of the
          city.

          As they continue, the hour gets progressively later in the
          day until the final sequence which takes place at night.
          Over this we hear our guy, PATRICK (30).

                     To people who grow up here, this city is
                     like family. The thing about family,
                     about the city, about the church, about
                     the people you grow up with-- is that no
                     matter how much they hurt you, no matter
                     what the cost is, you still love them.

                     And despite all our flaws-- what we do to
                     each other-- what is done to us-- I've
                     always felt proprietary about it all.

                     Like the old commercial for dog food:
                     'doesn't your dog deserve to be treated
                     like a member of the family?' I've always
                     believed it depended on the dog. Beyond
                     that, the most I thought about anything
                     was what I wanted to do. Who I wanted to
                     be. To rise where my father said I
                     couldn't go, to succeed. To be a man.

                    In the third Dorchester slaying in as
                    many days, 29 year old Chris Mullen was
                    gunned down in an apparent robbery. The
                    Police Commissioner defended the rising
                    tide of crime as a statistical abberation
                    tied to growing umemployment and the
                    humidity of an unusually sweltering
                    summer month.

          As they reach the sidewalk out front, Bressant cuts across

          SHOTS FIRE THROUGH THE DOOR and clip into Poole. It seems
          almost too clumsy to be real. He falls over, holding his
          neck.
          A moment of STUNNED SILENCE, then:
          Patrick runs from the car. Staying low, he races for the

          Patrick reaches Poole and lies on top of him. He messily
          checks for a pulse, gets smeared with blood.
          Poole is torn up. Several rounds hit where the vest wasn't,
          including his neck. He grunts. Patrick fumbles for his cell

          HOWLING can be heard from within.

          INT TRETT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          The foyer floor is spattered with blood. He cautiously moves
          forward.
          Into a completely bare room. He moves to the hallway.
          Just inside the hall a BODY lies motionless on its stomach.
          Patrick inches through the door, crouches next to the body,
          and cranes his head. It's Leon Trett: DEAD.
          Patrick momentarily pauses to examine Leon.

                         BOOM
           A GUNSHOT explodes and a SLUG rips into the wall above
          Patrick's head, showering him in plaster.
          Looking up, he sees Roberta Trett at the far end of the hall
          gripping her revolver.

          Roberta FIRES UP AT HIM. He scrambles up the stairs and

          open and he tumbles through.

          Patrick spins over and kicks the door closed. He springs to
          his feet, throws his body against the door, and locks it with
          the heavy DEAD BOLT on the POLICE DOOR.
          WHAM. Roberta slams into the other side of the door with
          everything she's got. She does it again, WHAM. And again,
          WHAM. But the door holds. Patrick turns to survey his
          surroundings.
          Patrick moves to ANOTHER ROOM outfitted with a COFFEE TABLE
          piled high with empty beer cans, a frayed COUCH, a small TV.
          The room connects to a small BEDROOM. Patrick steps toward.
          A SOILED, BARE MATTRESS lies in one corner.

          CORWIN EARLE.
          Crouched on the floor, naked from the waist down and wearing
          a half-shirt. His stare is bug-eyed & frightened.
          Corwin stares at Patrick, scared.

          He looks up at Patrick like a whipped dog, eyes shifting
          nervously to the door.

                         
          Patrick cautiously pushes open the door to the bathroom.
          He looks in the sink. There are bloody children's underwear
          soaking.
          Then Patrick looks in the BATHTUB.

          scream.

          BLACK.

          The Bartender is standing there with a smoking gun, in shock.
          Patrick leaps out of his chair and drives his head into

          plows his spine straight back into the bar.

          to be seen. He sees a BLOODY POPEYE MASK on the ground. A
          TRAIL OF BLOOD runs away from it which Patrick follows across
          the street.
          The thickening trail leads Patrick along the side of a LARGE
          3-STORY FACTORY (in the process of being converted to lofts)
          and to a DOOR near the back. Blood is smeared on the door and
          a small red puddle has formed on the ground.

          INT FACTORY STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS
          Leading with his gun, Patrick steps into a bright STAIRWELL.
          Blood tracks up the stairs and Patrick ascends cautiously.
          He climbs one flight.
          And then another -- pausing on the landing. Above him, light
          comes through an OPEN DOOR. He starts for it.
          Patrick continues up the last few steps. He reaches the top
          and peers out onto:

          Patrick scans the roof for Remy. He sees nothing on his right

          him we see a magnificent view of the neighborhood. He turns
          another corner to see:

                         
          Bressant sits against an aluminum vent - - his head leaned
          back and his eyes half closed. A ROSE OF BLOOD spreads out
          against Bressant's shirt. His flesh is beginning to grey.

                    What happened?

          EXT MASS TURNPIKE - DAY
          The car speeds along the empty highway, carving through thick
          forests of pine trees.
          Inside the car it's quiet. Patrick's stare is fixed to the
          road -- the rhythm of the white lines that pulse by. Angie
          rests her head against the passenger window, the BLUR of the
          tree-line reflected in her eyes.

          EXT . RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY
          A 2-LANE ROAD winds them through rolling hills and past a
          SIGN welcoming them to: 'WEST BECKETT, MA. Pop. 974' -- a
          Rockwell painting in the heart of the Berkshire Mountains.

          EXT TOWNSEND ROAD - MOMENTS LATER
          The car rolls down a quiet road where small COTTAGES nestle
          in clumps of birch and pine trees. Patrick parks opposite a
          long driveway. A MAILBOX at its mouth reads: DOYLE

          EXT. TOWNSEND

          Patrick and Angie sit in the car.   They look down a driveway.

                         
          She takes a beat.

                                             ANGIE
                    You want to tell me where our trip has
                    taken us?

                                             PATRICK
                    You know where we are.

                                             ANGIE
                    Yes.

                                             PATRICK
                    He was a part of it. They don't tape
                    calls. He handed us a transcript like it
                    was evidence and he knew it was a forgery-
                    -maybe he forged it himself. He knew
                    what they were doing, he supported it and
                    he covered it up.

                                            ANGIE
                    Why? For a third of a hundred and thirty
                    grand? What for?

                         
          He just looks at her.

                    Had to be for something.

                                                 ANGIE
                    When you're talking about ruining an old
                    man who lost his child and gave years of
                    service . . . "something" isn't enough.

                    it, you want to be sure.

          And he goes down the road.

           EXT DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER

                         
          They start down the driveway towards a small, red cottage set
          a hundred yards or so off the road. But after only a few
          steps, they stop.
          PATRICK & ANGIE'S POV: Through the trees, Doyle emerges from
          the cottage. He carries 2 FULL SUITCASES to a SUBURBAN and
          loads them in the back. His wife, FRANCINE, follows.
          Patrick & Angie take a beat before resuming down the drive.
          Only to FREEZE IN THEIR TRACKS at the sight of:

                         
          AMANDA MCCREADY CHARGING ONTO THE PORCH, clutching a BACK-
          PACK, and wearing a look of utter determination.

                                             AMANDA

          Doyle lifts Amanda off the porch and carries her to the
          Suburban. He dips down, allowing Amanda to place her back-
          pack inside.

                                             AMANDA

                       sitting, leaned up against the hood, he head tilted forward.

                       see she has been crying.

          Jack sits in his favorite chair. Amanda is on his    lap,
          facing him, arms around his shoulders, head tucked   into his
          neck. He slowly rocks the chair. He holds Amanda     like its

          over with zip-locked snacks and children's cups-- all the
          stuff Francine had packed to make sure Amanda would have,
          whereever she'd go.
          Over this all, beginning faintly and growing increasingly
          audible, is the inanity of the television news. It's blather

          sad.
          A swarm of West Beckett POLICE CRUISERS cram the small road.

          local cops' who are embarrassed to arrest him. He makes it
          easy for them.
          Doyle nods at the deputy with quiet acceptance and the

          Patrick sits next to Amanda on the couch . . . And together --
          silently -- they watch TV.
           Patrick sees that Amanda is holding her famous doll, the one
          the papers said she loved so much, the one Angie plucked from
          the quarry..

                     I started going to Church again. I saw
                     them bury Remy and, for the first time in
                     years, maybe ever, I prayed for someone.
                     I did everything I wanted to do. I proved
                     my father wrong. I either learned my
                     lesson or became a man, I can't tell the
                     difference . Either way, all it' s left me
                     is the hollow, copper aftertaste in my
                     throat, like a vague and distant regret.
                     Remy was right, I know very little--but
                     what I do know, I am sure of: I was wrong
                     about that commercial. "Shouldn' t your
                     dog be treated like a member of the
                     family?" It doesn't depend on the dog. It
                     depends on the family.
          We hold on them for an extended beat. The blather from the
          television washes over them, the man and the little girl.
