1      EXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - NIGHT                             1
       MOVING IN FAST MOTION -- a kaleidoscopic jewel box --
       glittering, shining and speeding PAST our eyes.

       MOVING south TO north FROM the Battery and the World
       Trade Center, streets and buildings FLIPPING PAST like
       black diamonds spilling INTO our peripheral vision and
       DISAPPEARING as we SPEED uptown TOWARD...

       Cars and people caught in the same frantic ballet of
       shining lights as we RACE UP the avenue, and the voice
       of Peter Fallow speaks to us...
                                 PETER (V.O.)
                   Yes. We're getting closer. Can
                   you feel it. Can you see it?
                   The heat. The brilliance. Moving
                   fast into the heart of it. Buzz.
                   Buzz. Can you feel the buzz? The
                   city is pulling you in. The city
                   of light. The city of diabolical
                   promise. The city of answered
                   prayers.

       the lower garage.
A11B   INT. LOADING AREA - LIMOUSINE - NIGHT                      A11B

       pulls up. A male and female aide -- both carrying
       walkie-talkies -- rush to open the door. They pry PETER
       FALLOW from the back seat. He is wearing a tuxedo and
       dark glasses. He is very drunk, disheveled and cheerful
       beyond his means. CONTINUE IN ONE SHOT as...
       TWO AIDES

       try to lead Fallow into the building. Fallow is clutch-
       ing a whiskey decanter and a seltzer bottle. He leans
       heavily on the aides, stumbles and can barely stay on his
       feet.

       MINI CART

       approaches. The aides flag it down and throw Fallow onto
       the cart. The cart carries him past the garbage con-
       tainer into a long tunnel-like corridor.

       FALLOW

       sways on the cart, trying to mix a drink for himself --
       he pulls a glass out of one pocket and some ice cubes out
       of another pocket. But he is physically incompetent.

       FEMALE AIDE
       jumps onto the cart and tries to hold him up.   The male
       aide runs alongside the cart.

       VARIOUS WAITERS
       in black tie carry covered silver trays as they trot
       through the tunnel.
       VARIOUS BUSBOYS

       come running in the other way, pushing carts filled with
       dirty dishes and glasses.
       CART

       comes to the end of the tunnel and jerks to a halt.
       Fallow loses his balance and sprays the female aide with
       soda water.
       MALE AIDE
       pulls Fallow off the cart and continues to lead him
       through a dark, red-lit area. Several security guards
       run to meet them. The guards and the aide now escort
       Fallow through the area.
       A FEW PHOTOGRAPHERS

       pop out of nowhere, trying to get a picture. The guards
       push them away and lead Fallow into a lighted corridor.

       FOREIGN DIPLOMAT

       and his wife and daughter join the entourage as they head
       for an elevator. The diplomat offers Fallow a pen and a
       book to autograph.

       Fallow misses the pen and falls face down into the
       breasts of the diplomat's daughter. The guards pull him
       into the elevator.

       CART OF FOOD

       is in the elevator -- a tray of salmon mousse in the
       shape of a three-foot salmon. The elevator starts to
       move.  Fallow falls into the mousse. The aide pulls him
       up and tries to clean him off.

       ELEVATOR DOORS
       open. Fallow is led out of the elevator. Several other
       aides approach him and pull off his soiled jacket and
       shirt and change them for fresh ones as they move.
       SOME BROADWAY AUTOGRAPH HOUNDS

       rush Fallow, snapping pictures with little Instamatics
       and trying to get an autograph.
       FALLOW
       is led through the corridor and into...
       WINTERGARDEN

       A ten story glass atrium. A black tie party. A sixty-
       foot banner with Fallow's name on it. Wild applause.
       But before Fallow can get his bearings...
       WALL OF FLASHING CAMERAS
       obliterate the view.    Fallow staggers, clutching his head
       and we...

11A    EXT. PARK AVE. APARTMENT - SKYLIGHT - EVENING               11A

       THROUGH the skylight we can see Sherman McCoy on his
       hands and knees on the green marble foyer of this lavish
       apartment chasing the family dachshund, trying to attach
       a leash.

                                  PETER (V.O.)
                    ... And it begins on a rainy
                    night, only a few months ago.

                                  SHERMAN
                    Come on, Marshall. Come here.
                    Stay. Come on. Stay.

       The dog escapes. Sherman smacks his perfect WASP knee
       on the perfect marble floor.

                   Our hero, Sherman McCoy, was about
                   to make a simple phone call. And
                   despite the existence of eleven
                   telephones and seven different
                   lines in the fourteen rooms of his
                   six million dollar plus apartment,
                   this was a phone call he could not
                   make at home.

                   I am taking the dog for a walk.

                                 JUDY
                   You are not taking the dog for a
                   walk. You are taking 'Marshall'
                   for a walk. Marshall has a name.
                   He is one of our family. And,
                   anyway, it's raining.
                                  SHERMAN
                   I know that.
      The DOG GROWLS and snaps at Sherman.

                                 JUDY
                   So does Marshall. I don't think
                   he wants to go. Do you, Marshall?                     *

                   Alright.   Alright.
      Sherman gets the leash fastened. He stands up, pulls
      on a rubberized British riding mac. Judy flicks a tiny
      plastic bag out of a cleverly-concealed container and
      hands it to Sherman.
                                 JUDY
                   Have a nice time.

      avoid this walk.

      is dragging Marshall out of the building as a limo pulls
      up and the immaculately-dressed POLLARD BROWNING gets
      out. He looks at Sherman, Sherman's clothes and Sherman's
      dog. He doesn't approve. As they pass each other under
      the awning...

                                SHERMAN
                   Yes. As a matter of fact, I did
                   notice.
                                 POLLARD
                   Ah, Sherman. A true friend to
                   man's best friend.
                                 SHERMAN
                   Pollard, you old phrase-maker.

                                 POLLARD
                   I beg your pardon.

                                 SHERMAN
                   I mean, is that the best you can
                   do? Is that as witty as we get?

      As Pollard enters the building and Sherman drags Marshall
      away...
                                 POLLARD
                   I don't know what you're talking
                   about. And furthermore, if you
                   plan on being wet when you return,
                   I suggest you take the service
                   elevator.

                             SHERMAN
               Well, you were right. I got
               soaking wet and Marshall didn't do
               anything.

     He heads for the bathroom, grabs a towel.

                             JUDY
               Sherman, if you want to talk to
               somebody named Maria, why do you
               call me instead?
     Sherman pokes his head into the room.

     She gets off the bike, grabs a robe and heads for the
     door.

                  She was right, of course. And

     from the second floor to the marble foyer. In this view,
     we can see that Sherman McCoy -- like his surroundings --
     is impeccably designed and dressed.
                             PETER (V.O.)
               The next morning, Judy's words
               were still ringing in his ears.
               Cheap. Rotten. And a liar.
               Alright. But was it really his
               fault. In a way she had brought
               it on herself, hadn't she?
     He intercepts Campbell at the foot of the stairs.

                             SHERMAN
               Campbell, honey. Are we ready?

               On the lifecycle again. You see?
               Like all those other women she
               spends so much time with. So
               drawn, so pale. You could see

     in exercise clothes, sweating and still crying. She
     looks like she's spent a sleepless night.

               She won't kiss me because I'm all
               wet.

                   lose our composure over a few
                   hundred million dollars.

35   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY                                    35

     Sherman and several men are seated at attention facing an
     Adam bowfront cabinet. The cabinet is richly painted
     with scenes of bucolic splendor and ornate borders. On
     top of this museum piece, a black plastic SPEAKER over
     which the voice of Gene Lopwitz is addressing his
     inferiors.
                                GENE (V.O.)
                  But what the hell is this crazy
                  Giscard deal going to cost us,
                  Sherman?
                                SHERMAN
                  I need six hundred million to buy
                  up the bonds...

                         (on speaker)
                  Jesus. You want us to sit on six
                  hundred million dollars worth of
                  French government bonds?!

                                SHERMAN
                  I'm confident on this, Gene.   It's
                  a real sleeping beauty.
     A THROTTLED ROAR comes out of the SPEAKER.

     he elbows her in the stomach. She falls to her knees

     Maria leans toward Sherman and presses her foot down on

     Sherman hits the brake.      The CAR stalls and comes to a
     SCREECHING halt.

                                 MARIA
                  It's a body.

                  It's an animal.

                  It's a wheel, that's all.   It's
                  a tire.
                                MARIA
                  It's a dead tire!

                  Calm down, Maria. Please. It's
                  a tire and some ash cans or
                  something.
     Sherman starts to get out of the car.
                                MARIA

     He leaves the door open. Above him, the tremendous
     CLANGING noise of CARS POUNDING along the expressway.
     But he can't see them. He can only hear them and feel
     their vibration. He stands there a moment, taking in the
     strangeness of the place and of his own situation -- the
     tire, Maria, his wife, his life. A little chill of lone-
     liness hits him. He shakes it off and walks to the tire
     -- a simple, inevitable move toward a destiny he could
     never have imagined.

     (ROLAND AUBURN). He looks dangerous. The other slight,
     hesitant, a few steps behind the first one (HENRY LAMB).
     They are both black.

     Sherman is standing there holding the tire.      The two
     young men are moving steadily toward him.
                                ROLAND
                  What happened, man? You need some

                  No thanks. Hi. No, I don't think
                  so. No. Thank you very much.
     Sherman is confused. He doesn't move. Maria gets behind
     the wheel of the car. Roland reaches slowly into his
     jacket pocket. He smiles and keeps moving toward Sherman.
     Sherman sees the hand moving out of the jacket pocket.
     He is still frozen. Maria BLOWS the HORN. Sherman wakes
     up finally.

                                 SHERMAN
                  Excuse me.   I have to go.

     Roland steps in front of him. They both keep moving.

                  take it.
     Sherman pushes the tire toward Roland. Roland pushes it
     back at him. Sherman throws up his arms. The tire
     bounces off his arms and knocks Roland down.

               I wonder if we should report this

               think maybe it's possible you... we
               hit one of them. There was this kind
               of... There was this sound. Did you
               hear it? Like we hit one of them.

               Neither did I. So if the question
               ever comes up, all that happened
               was, two boys blocked the road
               and tried to rob us and we got
               away. That's all we know.

                  was driving. And I'm saying
                  I didn't hit anybody, and I'm
                  not reporting anything to the

                   him back, he's got a     concussion.
                   He goes into a coma     and now they
                   classify him likely     to die.

                   You talked to him?

                   my balls. She says the kid      told
                   his mother he was hit by a     car. A
                   Mercedes. And the car left      the

                  That's hearsay. You may believe

                  not admissable in a court of law.

                  places. Now we'll do everything
                  we can for this lady. But we don't
                  have a hell of a lot to go on.
                                BACON
                  Gentlemen, I want you to make an
                  investment here. An investment in
                  steam control.
                                KRAMER
                  Steam control?
                                BACON
                  That's right. Steam control.
                  Because a righteous steam is building
                  up in the souls of my people and
                  that steam is ready to blow.

                                 KRAMER
                  I see.   Well...

                                BACON
                  Now, on judgment day, I am your
                  safety valve. Because when it
                  blows -- and it will, my friend --
                  how grateful you will be that I
                  am on your side -- the one nigger
                  who can control the steam and save
                  your lily white ass from being
                  burned off the face of the earth
                  so to speak.

                   Sherman, what are you looking for
                   in that newspaper?
                                  SHERMAN
                   Nothing.   I... uh... no, nothing
                   special.

                                 CAMPBELL
                   But what's a bond?

                                 MRS. McCOY
                          (delighted)
                   Oh, yes, Sherman, do explain it.

                                 MR. McCOY
                   Yes. Your mother and I really
                   want to hear this, Sherman.
                                 SHERMAN
                   A bond is a way of lending   people
                   money.  Let's say you want   to
                   build a road or a hospital   and you
                   need a lot of money. Well,    you
                   issue a bond...
                                 CAMPBELL
                   Do you build roads?

                                 SHERMAN
                   No, I don't actually build them...
                                 MR. McCOY
                   I think you're in over your head.
      More laughter.

                                 JUDY
                   Here. Let me try. Darling, Daddy
                   doesn't build roads or hospitals
                   or anything, really. Daddy just
                   handles the bonds for the people
                   who raise the money.
                                 CAMPBELL
                   That's what he said. Bonds.

                                 JUDY
                   Yes. See, just imagine that a
                   bond is a slice of cake. Now you
                   didn't bake that cake, but every
                   time you hand somebody a slice of
                   that cake, a little bit comes off,
                   little crumbs fall off. And you're
                   allowed to keep those crumbs.

                   Crumbs?   Really...

                                 MR. McCOY
                          (pointedly)
                   And many a man has sold his soul
                   for those little crumbs.

                                 JUDY
                          (enjoying this)
                   Yes. And that's what Daddy does.
                   He passes somebody else's cake
                   around and picks up the crumbs.
                   But you have to imagine a lot of
                   crumbs. And a great golden cake.
                   And a lot of golden crumbs. And
                   you have to imagine Daddy running
                   around picking up every little
                   golden crumb he can get his hands
                   on. That's what Daddy does.
                                 SHERMAN
                   Well, you can call them crumbs
                   if you want to...
                                 JUDY
                   That's the best I can do.   Excuse
                   me.

      She gets up abruptly and leaves. Mrs. McCoy goes after
      Judy. Sherman and his father sit there without talking.
      Then...
                                 MR. McCOY
                   Of course, in my day, there was
                   some integrity to it...

                                    SHERMAN
                   Yes.   Well...
                                 MR. McCOY
                   Now it's not about anything, is
                   it? Except the money.
                                 SHERMAN
                   I don't make the rules.

                                 MR. McCOY
                   All the more reason not to play
                   the game.

                                 SHERMAN
                   We're having a little... It's
                   nothing serious. Really.

104    INT. LEICESTER'S RESTAURANT - CLOSE ON PETER FALLOW -       104
       NIGHT

       Peter's face is flat on the bar. He looks bad -- drunk,
       out of shape, disheveled and probably unclean.
                               PETER (V.O.)
                 Of course, up to this point in our
                 story, I was blissfully ignorant.
                 I had no idea of the storm that
                 was gathering. Never even heard
                 of Sherman McCoy. Hadn't the
                 faintest notion that soon his name
                 would be inexorably tied to mine.
                 That his fate would be inextricably
                 bound to my own destiny.

       nudges Peter awake and puts three drinks into Peter's
       hands. Peter staggers away from the bar, carrying the
       drinks.
                               PETER (V.O.)
                 I had my own problems. And I
                 simply had no idea that Sherman
                 McCoy was the solution I was
                 looking for.

       enter the restaurant. He is handsome and young. She is
       older and not as pretty as he is. Peter intercepts them.
                               PETER
                 Caroline. You devil.    Come and
                 have a drink with us.

       Peter steers them to a table filled with people.

                              PETER
                 Yes. And a very pretty someone he
                 is, too.

                   Why don't you squeeze in next to
                   Billy Cortez. Billy, you keep your
                   hands to yourself. Now, Filippo,
                   you sit down on top of Billy and
                   I'll see if I can get Caroline to
                   sit down on my face.

      Peter sits in a chair and tries to pull Caroline into his
      lap. Caroline grabs Filippo.

                                 CAROLINE
                   No thanks, Peter. The last time I
                   sat on your face, I ended up with
                   a yeast infection.

      They leave.    Peter laughs and almost falls off his chair.

                                 MOORE

                   last night. And in the middle of
                   the pudding, this four-year-old                   *
                   child came in pulling a toy wagon
                   around the table and on the wagon
                   was a fresh turd. Her own, I
                   suppose. And the parents just
                   shook their heads and smiled.
                                  PETER
                   Incroyable!
                                 MOORE
                   I've made a big investment in you,
                   Peter. Time and money. And it's
                   not working. Now I could just
                   shake my head and smile. But in
                   my house, when a turd appears, we
                   deal with it. We dispose of it.
                   We flush it away. We don't put it
                   on the table and call it caviar.
                                 PETER
                   I see. Yes. Yes, of course.
                   Well, I am on to something right
                   now... and I think I've got...
                   it's just a matter of... this is
                   something that is really going to
                   break open!
      Moore just looks at him.       Then...

                                 MOORE
                   I sincerely hope so, Fallow. I
                   sincerely hope so. Come, Evelyn.

      They march into the back room of the restaurant.
                                 PETER (V.O.)
                   It was the end of the road for me.
                   I could see it coming. See it

                                 RIFKIN
                   I got sixty-five students in
                   every class...

                                 PETER
                   Do you have any of his written
                   work?
                                 RIFKIN
                   Oh, Jesus, there hasn't been any
                   written work at Ruppert High
                   since... oh, fifteen years.
                   Maybe twenty.
                                 PETER
                   Well, there must be some record
                   of how he measures up to the
                   others...
                                 RIFKIN
                   No. See, you're thinking about
                   grades and honor students and high
                   achievers. We don't make those
                   kinds of comparisons. We're just
                   trying to keep them off the
                   street. At Ruppert High, an honor
                   student is somebody who comes to
                   class and doesn't piss on the
                   teacher.

                                 PETER
                          (pauses; then)
                   Well, by that standard, is Henry
                   Lamb an honors student?

                                 RIFKIN
                   Well, he never pissed on me. So
                   by that standard, yes. I guess he
                   must be.

                   I sublet it for eleven hundred a

                   a car coming in -- oh, God, ten
                   minutes. We have time for a
                   quickie. What do you say?

                   million dollars. And possibly my
                   job. I don't feel terrifically

                    this, Mr. Fallow. This is show
                    business. And I've never known
                    the two to go hand in hand.

                 with a heart that is angry. Heart

                 of that car did nothing for him!
                 And neither did the police. And

                And while authorities are dragging
                their feet, the protesters were
                sending a message to Bronx district
                attorney and mayoral candidate
                Abe Weiss -- 'If you don't launch

                   I am here to join with the black
                   community in expressing not only
                   its grief but also its outrage.
                   And, of course, whatever I can
                   do to help Mrs. Lamb, I will do.

                    Could we go there and take a look

                    Soon as we leave here. We could
                    take a look. There's things
                    that's consistent with an incident
                    like this. We don't find those
                    things, we move on down the list.

                    Yeah.

                                  SHERMAN
                    I see.

                                  MARTIN
                    We don't have a description of a
                    driver. So we gotta look for the
                    car. And that means bothering a
                    lot of innocent people. We're
                    sorry about the inconvenience.
                    But it's a routine sort of thing.
                                  SHERMAN
                    I understand. But if it is a
                    routine, well, I should, I guess
                    I ought to... well, follow the
                    routine that's appropriate to me,
                    to someone with a car in this

                    No.   I don't follow.
                                  SHERMAN
                    Well, I mean, if you have a
                    routine in an investigation like
                    this -- I don't know how these
                    things work, but there must also
                    be a routine for a person like me,
                    an owner of a car with a license
                    number -- I think that's what I
                    need to consider. The routine.
                                  MARTIN
                    We just want to look at the car.
                                  SHERMAN
                    That's what I mean. You see?

                    Well, I... how do you mean?

                                  GOLDBERG
                    Because, if there is, now is the
                    time to tell us. Before things
                    get complicated.

                                  SHERMAN
                    No. I just think... I think that,
                    just to be sure, certain, safe...
                    I think...
                                  GOLDBERG
                    Let me put it this way, if you
                    want to cooperate, that's great.
                    If you have reasons for not
                    cooperating, then I should tell
                    you that you don't have to say
                    anything. That's your right. If
                    you want, you can say nothing at
                    all. You also have the right to
                    an attorney. I mean, for that
                    matter, if you lacked the 'funds'
                    for an attorney, the state would
                    provide you with one -- free of
                    charge.   If that's what you
                    wanted.

       Goldberg sits down on the edge of Sherman's desk.
                                  SHERMAN
                    Well, look. I guess what I should
                    do is, I should... I should talk
                    this over with an attorney.

                say, hello, I'm from Legal Aid,
                I'm your lawyer. And he says,

                I'm telling you, they got nothing

                              KILLIAN
                I believe you. It was a set-up.
                They were going to take you off.
                Sounds to me like he's got good
                reasons not to come forward. You
                just sit tight. That's what you
                do.

                                 SHERMAN
                   Look, you were recommended as the
                   best criminal lawyer around. I'm
                   not disagreeing with you. But I
                   didn't come here to... I mean, I
                   want to pre-empt this whole
                   situation. I don't want it to go
                   any further.
                                 KILLIAN
                   What does that mean?

                                 SHERMAN
                   It means I want to take the
                   initiative. I want to go to the
                   police with Maria -- Mrs. Ruskin
                   -- and just tell them exactly what
                   happened. I mean, I don't know
                   about the law, but I feel morally
                   certain that we did what was right
                   -- in the situation we were in.
                   And I don't see...
                                 KILLIAN
                   Ayyyy! You Wall Street honchos
                   are real gamblers. Ayyy!
                   Whaddaya whaddaya! They would
                   devour you. They would eat you
                   up.
                                SHERMAN
                   But why?
                                 KILLIAN
                   Forget it's already a political

                   Reverend Bacon and Weiss has an
                   election coming up. Forget that
                   and remember that when you work in
                   the D.A.'s office and every day
                   you prosecute people with names
                   like Tiffany Latour and Sancho
                   Rodriguez and Chong Wong and
                   Shabazz Kazan Tamali, you are
                   dying to get your hands on a nice
                   white couple like you and Mrs.
                   Ruskin. Biscuit city, ehhh! You
                   open your mouth and they will
                   arrest you. And they will make a
                   big show out of arresting you.
                   And it will be very unpleasant.

                They give you the scholarly view.
                You know. It's terrific for

                as it doesn't involve real
                people.

                Hey, Andruitti, you guinea, how
                are you? Yeah. Well, I'm sitting
                here with Sherman McCoy. Yeah.
                That's right. Well, I don't know
                if he needs a lawyer. What do you
                think?

                   dollars?! We are hemorrhaging money,

                   You're right. It might be cheaper

                    itself takes us into his arms and
                    burns us with the fever of living,
                    dragging us like Don Juan into the
                    bonfires of hell. The words of the
                    ghost ringing in our ears... 'Repent!

      As Sherman climbs into the back seat...
                             MARTIN
               Be careful of your clothes. My
               kid got all this Styrofoam shit
               back there. They stick to your
               clothes.

                             KILLIAN
               How do you feel?
                             SHERMAN
               Top notch. Look. You said this
               was just a formality.
                              KILLIAN
               No problem.   They promised me.
                            SHERMAN
               I told Maria. I saw her last
               night. In case we need her.
                             KILLIAN
               That explains it. She left the
               country this morning. You know
               some Italian painter named Filippo
               Sharutti, something like that?
                               SHERMAN
               I don't know.    Why?

                             KILLIAN
               I think your girl friend found
               a new boyfriend.

                               SHERMAN
               But...

                             KILLIAN
               It's not going to be so bad. This
               is routine. I talked to Andruitti
               again last night. He promised me.
               We'll be in and out of there. No
               problem. Nobody is ever going to
               know it happened.
                             MARTIN
               We got to cuff him.

      opens a side door.   We wait. Nothing. Then the sound
      of FEET SHUFFLING.   Finally, Sherman appears. He looks
      like a man who has  been dragged through hell -- his
      body, his clothing,  the look in his eyes. He staggers
      toward the bench.

      is representing the District Attorney's office.
                              JUDGE WHITE
                Mr. McCoy, you know the charges
                that are being brought against
                you.
                                SHERMAN
                Hmn?    What?
                              JUDGE WHITE
                We want to know how you plead to
                the charges.
                                SHERMAN
                I am sorry.

                                JUDGE WHITE

                   Your Honor, the defendant is under
                   extreme stress. He pleads not
                   guilty.

                                 SHERMAN
                   I repent all the sins of my past

       is sitting on the steps of the courthouse. He is still
       covered with mud from having been trampled earlier. He
       takes a long swig from a bottle wrapped in a paper bag.
       He is drunk.

                    It was too much for me. All of it.
                    Sherman McCoy had been swept away
                    from me. Before I could even speak
                    to him. And as the day progressed,
                    I began to appreciate the power, the
                    magnitude of the force that had been
                    unleashed by my little story.

                    That's alright. Thanks.     I should
                    go.

                    Not in a million years.

                                  SHERMAN
                    My father took the subway every                            *
                    day of his life.                                           *
                                 PETER
                    Yeah. But he didn't live in the                            *

                                    SHERMAN
                    No.
       They both laugh.
                                  SHERMAN
                    I look terrible.
                                  PETER
                    You look like shit.       And you smell,
                    too.

                                  SHERMAN
                    I think, when I was in the jail,
                    I pissed in my pants.

       They laugh again. Sherman gets caught somewhere between
       laughing and crying. He starts to lose control.
                                    PETER
                    Take it easy.

                                    SHERMAN
                    I'm alright.

                                    PETER
                    Yeah.
                                  SHERMAN
                    I can't think.

        as the car slows down.     Sherman is slightly drunk.
                                   SHERMAN
                     ... and then this newspaper thing
                     started, this Peter Fallow person,
                     and all the facts were wrong, total
                     disregard for the truth. Why do
                     they do this?
                                   PETER
                     This is you. You'll be right on
                     Lexington Avenue.

                                   SHERMAN
                     They call me by my first name.
                     Like they know me. Like they own
                     me. Newspapers, lawyers, police,
                     people I don't even know. How did
                     I get to be so important?
                                   PETER
                     You're not important. You're just
                     dinner. You know what I mean? And
                     a week from now, a month -- nobody
                     is even going to remember what they
                     ate.

        The car stops. Sherman steps onto the platform.        Peter
        remains in the car. Sherman looks back at him.

                                   SHERMAN
                     I should have called the police
                     right away, when it happened. But
                     I couldn't you see? It wasn't
                     really my decision.

                                   PETER
                     How do you mean?

                                   SHERMAN
                     I mean, I wasn't driving the car.

        him. He catches it. Before anyone sees him, he enters
        through the service entrance.

                   Oh, my darling, is this a bad
                   time?
                                 SHERMAN
                   I beg your pardon...

                                 SALLY
                   What am I saying? Of course it's
                   a bad time. But I just wanted to
                   see if I can be of any help.

                   Well, that's very kind of you.

                   You know I haven't been in this
                   apartment since the McCleods had
                   it. That was before the
                   Kittridges. I hope I'm not being
                   out of place.

                   Anyway, thank you.

                   No, really, anything I can do.
                   With the apartment, is what I

                                 SALLY
                   I find people often need to be as
                   liquid as they can in these
                   situations and I know I can get
                   you seven-and-a-half right at
                   this moment. Fabled aristocratic
                   tycoon -- it's the celebrity
                   appeal. Maybe eight. If we act
                   quickly this kind of opportunity
                   doesn't come along every day. You
                   have to ride the wave.

                                 SHERMAN
                   Here it is.
                                 POLLARD
                   Sherman, we've known each other
                   a long time. We went to Buckley
                   together. My father knew your
                   father. I speak as a friend. But
                   also as president of the board.
                   Is that a gun?
                                 SHERMAN
                   I wonder if I can get both barrels
                   into my mouth. That's what I was
                   thinking. And how do you pull the
                   trigger. I read somewhere about a
                   man who took off his shoe and
                   pulled the trigger with his toe.

                                 POLLARD
                   Yes. This can't be a comfortable
                   situation for you.

                   And where would I do it?   Who
                   would find me?
                                 POLLARD
                   Exactly. Yes. Have you
                   considered... changing residence
                   until things quiet down?
                                 SHERMAN
                   You want me to leave?

                                POLLARD

                   Daddy.    Dinner.
                                 MOORE
                   Yes, darling. Shall we have Peter
                   here come along with us?

                                  EVELYN
                   Lovely.
      Gerald and Evelyn lead Peter toward the back dining room.

                                 MOORE
                   I want to give this story our full
                   attention, Peter. It makes us look
                   better and better, the more we do
                   for this Lamb family. Poor little
                   Lambs, poor little fuzzy-wuzzy wogs.
      Caroline Heftshank intercepts them.     She is very drunk.

                                 CAROLINE
                   Excuse me, Peter. There's a phone
                   call for you upstairs in the office.

      Peter makes excuses to Gerald and Evelyn and follows
      Caroline away.

                   She was also subletting Filippo.

                   in the car with Sherman McCoy when
                   the accident happened.

                   The apartment was bugged. They
                   had a wire in the intercom. They
                   were trying to prove that I
                   wasn't living there. Which I
                   wasn't. Now I've lost the
                   apartment and the boyfriend.

                                 PETER
                   You don't know where they are?

                   No. But I'm trusting you to find
                   them. And when you do. Give
                   them this. Tell them this is the

      She takes one of the Xerox copies and hands it to Peter.
      Peter leaves. Caroline looks at the Xerox copy.

                   My wife! My wife! I'm glad she's

                   Give me a Couvoisier V.S.O.P.

                   Yes.   Uh... where is Maria, by the

                   she's in Italy. I'm not supposed
                   to drink. But I love a sidecar.

                   me to them. So. You're on the

                   profile piece. We're calling it
                   the 'New Tycoons.' And, naturally,

      are bringing the main course to the table. Arthur is
      guzzling wine as he talks. Peter is bored silly.
                                 ARTHUR
                   ... But the best is just a few
                   weeks ago, one of these jackass
                   pilots, he lands long and the
                   plane goes off the runway. I was
                   there. I was on the plane. We're
                   going into Mecca, see. And the
                   plane is full of Arabs and all these
                   animals -- sheep, goats, chickens.
                   They won't travel without their
                   animals. We had to put plastic
                   in the cabins. You know, they
                   urinate, they defecate...
                                PETER
                   Yes.
                                 ARTHUR
                   Anyway, the plane goes off the
                   runway and we hit the sand with
                   a hell of a jolt and the right
                   wing tip digs into the sand and
                   the plane skids around in a circle!
                   360 degrees before we stop! We're
                   scared shitless. Panic. And we
                   look into the cabin and there's
                   everybody calm, quiet, they're
                   picking up their luggage and their
                   animals and they're looking out
                   the window at the little fire that
                   started on the wing and they're
                   waiting for the doors to open like
                   nothing happened. And then it
                   dawns on me. They think this is
                   normal!
      He starts to laugh as he talks.

                                 ARTHUR
                   They think this is the way you

                   you spin around until you stop.

                           harder and harder)
                   What do they know? They never
                   rode in an airplane. They think

      Peter tries to laugh with Arthur. But Arthur's coughing
      turns into a spasm. He pushes his head back against
      the banquette. He seems to be humming. And then his
      head drops forward and he slumps against Peter.
                                  PETER
                   Arthur?   Arthur?

      Two waiters   help the Maitre d' pull the table out.
      Arthur slips   off his plate and falls onto the floor.
      Some people   notice. But, in general, the activity
      in the room   continues.

      The Maitre d' gives orders to the waiters.

                   Excuse me, Monsieur Roberts. You
                   are not a doctor. And there are
                   legal complications.

      dead.

                    suffered. But ten million dollars
                    in damages will certainly make

                    Well, yes, I could use a few
                    things, Reverend, thank you. I
                    been worried about my clothes for
                    instance. I feel that the
                    presentation of my person should
                    be carefully designed. As a model
                    to black mothers everywhere, I
                    think I should have the right
                    wardrobe. So if you could have
                    Mr. Fox's limousine pick me up in
                    the morning, I could do some
                    shopping.

                    I'll need some furniture, too.
                    And a new refrigerator.
                    And although I should probably
                    continue to live in that shithole
                    of an apartment at least until
                    after the lawsuit is settled, I
                    would like to start looking now
                    for a co-op in Manhattan -- for me
                    and my son -- something with a view
                    of the river and preferably in a
                    neighborhood that is at least
                    upwardly mobile.

        Peter and Leach continue talking.

                                PETER (V.O.)
                  In less than three minutes, I had
                  what I was looking for. It was
                  more than a story. I had the
                  makings of a book here. A great
                  book. A prize winning effort.
                  All I needed was a big finish.

        Leach opens the door wide and Fallow steps into the apart-
        ment. As the door closes...
                                PETER (V.O.)
                  So I shipped off a little present

                    I suppose we could still go to the

                    think I'm the one who should make
                    the decision? And I say, no. No,
                    Sherman. Trust me.

                    Then we have this as evidence.
                                  KILLIAN
                    No. It's an illegal      tape. Totally
                    illegal. The guy who      did this
                    could go to jail for     this. Now if
                    this were your tape,     it would be
                    legal. But it's not.

                                  SHERMAN
                    What do you mean, 'my tape'?

                                  KILLIAN
                    Well, if you were wired and you
                    recorded your own conversation
                    that would be okay. But there is
                    no way that this tape can be used
                    as evidence in a court of law.

                                  SHERMAN

                    Was I? I don't remember. Isn't
                    it funny how a little thing like
                    that can slip your mind?
                           (she kisses him)
                    God, there's something about
                    funerals that is so stimulating.
                    My panties have been wet all
                    morning.

                                  SHERMAN
                    Maria, please...
       She kisses him again.

                Then why are you all hunched over?
      Her hands slide down his back.

                                 MARIA
                   You don't have a belt buckle in
                   the back. There's some sort of
                   subterfuge afoot here. Isn't
                   there?
                                 SHERMAN

      She pulls the wire. Sherman yelps in pain. As he spins
      around, Maria grabs the tapedeck and pulls it off his
      back. More pain.

                   Well, you know I have always been
                   a great believer in the truth.
                   I've lived my life as honestly as
                   I know how. I believe in the
                   truth as an essential companion
                   to a man of conscience, a beacon
                   in the vast and dark wasteland of
                   our modern world. And yet...

                   was driving the car when Henry
                   Lamb was hit?

                   now. The darkness closed in around

                   peculiar thing. Sherman was smiling.

                   angle, or a contract, or a hustle
                   or a campaign or a trick or a bid
                   for sympathy. Decency is not the
                   beast that bays for money, power,
                   dominion, position, votes and
                   blood! Decency is what your
                   mother taught you! Decency is
                   in your bones! Do I make myself
                   clear! Now go home. Go home now.
                   Be decent people. Be decent.

                    Alamo, as a symbol of slaughtered

       He walks up to the iron gates. The faces of the demon-
       strators are pressed against it. The Judge shakes a
       tired fist at them. Then he turns to Sherman.
