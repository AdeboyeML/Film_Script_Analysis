          EXT. FARMLAND - DAWN
          
          IN BLACK AND WHITE, A black 1930s Cadillac speeds down       
          the only visible road amidst endless plains of farmland.
          The road curves sharply ahead - the car accelerates.
          Ignoring the turn, the Caddy drives directly off the road
          and through a massive field of emptiness.
          
          The car abruptly stops in the middle of the vacant field.
          GENERAL BRAT (58, a patch covers one of his eyes) and
          AGENT BLACK SUIT (an agent in a black suit) step out of
          the car.
          
          Although there is clearly nothing in sight for miles, the
          General scans his surroundings with concern.

          Agent Black Suit crouches down and pulls open a METAL
          HATCH in the ground. Both men walk down the hatch and
          into the earth.
          
          
          INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - MOMENTS LATER
          
          They descend a metal staircase and walk with great
          urgency down a narrow corridor. The hallway spills into a
          hauntingly huge metal room with a lone SCIENTIST standing
          in the middle. The Scientist immediately begins leading
          them across the room.
          
                                 GENERAL BRAT
                    When did it start?
          
                                 SCIENTIST
                    At 05:00. We're seven minutes in.
          
          
          INT. OBSERVATION LAB - CONTINUOUS
          
          The three men enter a large room divided by a one-way
          mirror.
          
          On their side, numerous SCIENTISTS, utilizing several
          archaic devices, are busy at work monitoring the subject
          on the other side of the mirror.
          
          The subject: PRIVATE MILLER (22, naive and dutiful) sits
          at a small table with a microphone on it. Miller raises
          his hand, REVEALING a smoldering JOINT.
          
                                                                    2
          
          
          He takes a long and awkward hit from the joint and bursts
          into a coughing fit.
          
          The scientists begin to scribble profusely as their
          devices blink manically. General Brat and Agent Black
          Suit exchange a concerned look. The General lights a
          cigarette as the Scientist steps up to a small microphone
          in the corner.
          
                                 SCIENTIST
                           (into microphone)
                    Private Miller, we are now going to ask
                    you several questions. How do you feel?
          
          His voice booms through large speakers on Miller's side
          of the room. Miller leans towards the microphone.
          
                                  PRIVATE MILLER
                    Uh, I feel a little queer sir. But...
                    It's good. Good queer.
                           (beat)
                    Sir. Good queer, Sir.
          
          The scientists scribble madly. One of them mumbles into
          General Brat's ear.
          
                                 PRIVATE MILLER (CONT'D)
                    But...uh...even though I feel queer, Sir,
                    I should mention that I'm also feeling
                    quite gay...so, a little queer, but
                    mostly gay.
          
                                 SCIENTIST
                    Private Miller. When you think of your
                    superiors, what emotions do you feel?
          
                                 PRIVATE MILLER
                           (holding out the joint)
                    This went out...Sir.
          
                                 SCIENTIST
                    We will send someone in. Now answer the
                    question.
          
          A door opens beside Private Miller and an AGENT steps out
          wearing an intricate uniform that resembles an old
          fashioned diving suit, an air hose leading out the door
          that he came from. He slowly walks toward the Private,
          who looks at him in shock.
          
                                 SCIENTIST (CONT'D) (O.S)
                           (through speakers)
                    Private Miller? Answer the question.
          
                                                                     3
          
          
          
                                 PRIVATE MILLER
                    Oh...um...what was the question again?
          
          The Agent in the strange suit reaches the private and
          holds a lighter up to the joint.
          
                                 SCIENTIST (O.S.)
                           (through speakers)
                    What are your emotions towards your
                    superiors?
          
          Miller pulls at the joint until it is lit again. The
          Agent exits the room.
          
                                  PRIVATE MILLER
                     COUGH   COUGH  Fucking shit.
                           (beat)
                    Well, now that I think of it, it's
                    strange that they are called my
                    `superiors'. Does that make me their
                    `inferior'? I mean, that's pretty fucked
                    up.
          
          General Brat scowls.
          
                                 GENERAL BRAT
                           (curtly to the scientists)
                    I've seen enough. Shut it down. Bury the
                    hatch, sell the land, and dispose of him.
                    This never happened.
          
          Instantly, the scientists start packing up their
          equipment. Staring at Miller, General Brat grabs a RED
          PHONE and dials. Two Agents in the scuba-like suits
          emerge from behind Miller and start aggressively dragging
          him away.
          
                                 PRIVATE MILLER
                           (freaking out)
                    Hey! What the...what are you guys doing!              
                    Let go of me!
                           (desperately looking at the
                            mirror)
                    Sir!!! Sir!!! Help me!!!
          
                                  GENERAL
                           (into phone)
                    This is General Brat. We've reached a
                    final conclusion on Item 9.
                           (beat)
                    Illegal.
          
          He hangs up the phone.
          
                                                                     4

          DALE DENTON (late 20s, out of shape, slightly unkempt)
          looks out of place in his black suit as he drives he sits       
          in his cluttered and worn old lady car. He smokes a joint       
          while listening to talk radio.                                  
          
                                 TALK RADIO DJ                            
                    Well, let's look at the facts.                        
                    Financially, coins are better because                 
                    they're cheaper, and environmentally,                 
                    forget-about-it, coins win hands down.                
                    For those just joining us, we're with                 
                    caller Dale Denton discussing if America              
                    should lose the paper dollar bill.                    
          
          We see that Dale has a wireless ear piece in.                   
          
                                 DALE                                     
                    Of course not! Who wants a pocket full of             
                    coins? Seriously. Weighs down your pants,             
                    clangs around. With all this unnecessary              
                    new security everywhere, we'll be setting             
                    off alarms left and right!                            
          
                                 TALK RADIO DJ                            
                    We certainly do, Mr. Denton. Crude, but               
                    to the point. Next caller!                            
          
          Dale puts away his phone and pulls up in front of a nice        
          house.                                                          
          
          
          EXT. FRONT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER                                 
          
          Dale, wearing a name tag that reads "Garth", holding a          
          clip board and wearing a greenpeace hat, knocks                 
          repeatedly on the door. A woman cautiously answers the          
          door.                                                           
          
                                 WOMAN                                    
                    Um, I didn't order a pizza.

                    Excuse me, miss? Are you Sandra Danby                 
          
                                                                     5

          Dale shoves an envelope into her hand.                          
          
                                 DALE                                     
                    Sorry, miss, but you've failed to show up             
                    to your divorce proceedings 4 times under             
                    court order. You've been served.                      
          
                                 WOMAN                                    
                    Oh great! Thanks a lot asshole! Real                  
                    clever! Go fuck yourself!                             
          
          Dale dashes back to his car as the upset woman starts to        
          open the envelope.                                              
          
          
          INT. DALE'S CAR - SOON AFTER                                    
          
          Dale is driving and smoking a joint. He looks at his            
          check list - it is a list of people he served that day.         
          He's only got a few left. He listens to a different talk        
          radio dj while playing music from a tiny iPod boom box          
          that sits in his passenger seat.

                    let's talk about real threats, threats to             
                    our home and security...

                    Fuckin' eh.                                           
          
          His iPod starts playing HOT STEPPA by INI KAMOZE.               
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)

          Dale turns down the talk radio and puffs away at his            
          joint; he enthusiastically dances in his car while              
          singing along.

          Dale, wearing a Zerox hat, walks into the building.             
          
                                 SECRETARY                                
                    Can I help you?

                    Just here to check out some units.                    
          
          The secretary nods and goes back to her work. Dale              
          casually waltzes down the office halls looking at the           
          names on the doors. He glances down at his clipboard, it        
          read: Walter Tandum.                                            
          
          He finds the office and knocks on the door.                     
          
                                    WALTER (O.S.)

          Dale enters to see Walter, a 40 year old accountant,            
          seated at his desk.

          Dale drops a blue envelope on Walter's desk.

          Dale turns and walks away. As he does, he notices a small       
          kitchen. He enters and is delighted at the array of             
          snacks and beverages. He helps himself.

          Dale is parked at a look-out enjoying the food, smoking         
          weed and has his ear piece in.

          Dale gets out of his car, followed by some plumes of            
          smoke, and goes to his trunk. He chuckles as he takes out       
          a lab coat and walks towards the hospital.

          Dale, looking very professional in his lab coat, rushes         
          to reception.

          Dale, wearing a chauffeur hat, stands by the main               
          entrance holding a sign that reads: JOSH CORBER. A man          
          walks out of the hotel and, seeing the sign, approaches         
          Dale.

                    she? I was just telling her before I left
                    how I've never been in a limo. Can you
                    believe it? 35 and I've never been in a
                    limo. Man! It's not stretched, is it?
          
          Dale hands him a BLUE ENVELOPE.

                    Sorry, but you've been served.
          
          Dale walks away. CORBER opens the envelope and reads it.        
          
                                 CORBER

          Dale completely ignores Corber as he dumps the sign and          
          walks out of the airport. Then, a huge smile comes across
          his face. He has noticed a nearby Burger King.

          He happily walks toward the food.
          
          
          INT - DALE'S CAR - DAY
          
          Dale sits in his car   outside a high school. An array of        
          Burger King wrappers   surrounds him as he rolls a joint         
          with the last of his   weed on top of a Batman comic. He         
          lights the joint and   turns on the radio.                       
          
                                 RADIO DJ                                  
                    ...3:09 in the PM and we-                              
          
          Dale turns off the radio, takes one last haul, and then          
          snubs out the joint. He then pulls out a small leather           
          kit and sifts through it's contents: handi-wipes, hand           
          sanitizer, a little vial of cologne, Visine, mouthwash           
          and breath mints.                                                
          
          Dale vigorously wipes his hands, face, and mouth with wet        
          naps and then starts futilely attempting to put visine in        
          his blazing red eyes. Frustrated, he squirts Visine all          
          over his finger tips and simply rubs them into his eyes.         
          He uses the mouthwash, chews up a mint, dabs on some             
          cologne, and then gets out of the car.

          Dale turns to see his attractive 19 year old girlfriend,         
          ANGIE ANDERSON, walking towards him with her group of

                    So, are you going to come over for dinner          
                    tomorrow, `cause my parents are beginning          
                    to think I made you up.

                    You don't have to feel weird about it.             
                    They know how old you are and they're              
                    fine with it. They just want to meet you           
                    and see that you're a cool guy and that            
                    I'm not dating you just because you're             
                    older.

                    just...tomorrow's tight. I've got a whole          
                    bunch of cases that I can finish                   
                    tomorrow. It's probably going to take me           
                    into the night.

                    I'm 19. I moved here from Morocco.                    
          
          Dale doesn't know what to make of Mr. Edwards comments          
          and looks.

                    Alright, well this school is for students             
                    and faculty only. Friends can't just stop             
                    by.

                    Dude, you may be a teacher here, but                  
                    we're about the same age, so don't get                
                    all high and mighty. It's not that weird.             
                    Frankly, it's natural.                                
          
                                                                    12

                    Well, in that case, get off school                    
                    property or I'm calling the Police                    
                    Liaison officer. Angie, no offense to                 
                    you, but if this guy's dating someone                 
                    your age, it's because nobody his age                 
                    will date him.                                        
          
          Then, four HANDSOME AND FIT STUDENTS walk by.

                    Hey Angie. You were hilarious in drama                
                    today.                                                
          
          Angie smiles at the guys. Dale doesn't like how all this        
          is going down.

          Dale and Angie sit in the parked car making out.

                    No...actually I can't. I have to go serve             
                    a guy.

                    Yeah. It sucks. I'm sorry. We can hang                
                    out later though. You can come over.

                    We'll see if Neo is truly the one.                    
                                                                          
          
          They share a long kiss, and Angie gets out of the car.          
          Dale watches her walk away, then whips out his cell phone       
          and hits speed dial.

          joints that intersect one another). Pot and paraphernalia
          are scattered all over the coffee table. A large

          knock at the door and Dale enters.

                    Um...sure.
          
          Dale awkwardly sits down on the other side of the couch.
          
                                                                    14

                    Brass tacs. I've got this new bud.
                    Unfortunately, it's a few more bones, but
                    fortunately, it's hands down the dopest
                    fuckin' shit I ever smoked. And I've
                    smoked some dope fuckin' shit.
          
                                 DALE
                    Better than that Blue Oyster weed?
          
                                 SAUL
                    Dude. Seriously. It's like if that Blue
                    Oyster shit and the Afghan Kush I got had
                    a baby, and meanwhile, the craziest
                    Northern Lights and that red-ass Espresso
                    Snowflake had a baby, and then by some
                    miracle those babies met, and fucked -
                    then this would be the shit they'd birth.
          
          Saul pulls out a big bag of weed. He places it on the
          coffee table as though it was his child. He pulls out a
          large bud.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    Smell it.
          
          Dale takes the weed and looks at it. It looks
          spectacular. Bright red hairs and large crystals, huge
          purple and blue leaves - just spectacular! Dale smells it
          and is taken aback.
          
                                 DALE
                    What is this? It's spectacular.
          
                                 SAUL
                    It's called Pineapple Express. My guy Red
                    told me it's when this Hawaiian flood
                    takes special dirt to the weed or some
                    shit. It's pretty scientific. And I'm the
                    only guy in the whole city who has it.
                    And, its only ten bones more for a
                    quarter.
          
                                 DALE
                    So...can I get a quarter?
          
                                 SAUL
                    No doubt. Just let me grab my scale.
          
          Saul walks into another room. Dale looks around
          anxiously; he clearly wants to go.                              
          
                                                                    15
          
          
          
          A moment later, Saul comes back into the room and sits
          down. Dale notices that he didn't bring anything back
          from the other room. Saul notices Dale looking at him
          strangely.

                                 DALE
                    Where's the scale?
          
                                 SAUL
                    Oh shit! The scale. Be right back.
          
          Saul hustles into the other room.
          
                                  SAUL (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                           (from other room)
                    You know what's weird? How sometimes,
                    your brain just chooses to like, not keep
                    things in it, you know?
                           (beat)
                    Fucking scale.

                    Shit. Where is it?
          
          Dale checks his watch and then looks at the door;
          suddenly, something catches his eye - it's the cross-
          joint Saul was constructing.
          
                                 DALE
                    Holy shit! What the fuck is this thing?
          
          Saul comes back in and puts a small electronic scale on
          the coffee table.
          
                                 SAUL
                            (nonchalantly)
                    Ah, the cross-joint. You've never seen
                    one of these? Not surprising. They are,
                    like, the apex of the vortex of joint
                    engineering. NASA built the first one in              
                    the eighties.                                         
          
          Saul chuckles at his joke as he places some weed on the         
          scale.
          
                                 DALE
                    You can actually smoke that contraption?
          
          Saul puts Dale's weed in a baggie.
          
                                                                    16
          
          
          
                                 SAUL
                    You light all three ends at the same
                    time, then, you smoke it as it resonates
                    the main section, creating a "trifecta"
                    of smoking power. It's like, three times
                    as powerful as a normal joint.
          
          Dale hands Saul some money and Saul gives him his weed.
          Dale lingers for a moment.
          
                                 DALE
                    Well, be careful with that thing.
          
          Dale gets up and heads to the door.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Dude...you wanna smoke this thing with
                    me?
          
          Dale turns around. He clearly wants to smoke it, but he
          tries to play it cool.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    I can't even light it on my own.
          
          Dale sits back down on the couch, giddy as a schoolgirl.
          
                                 DALE
                           (excited)
                    Wow. So like, uh...so like, so like what
                    do I do?
          
          Saul gathers three lighters from the coffee table.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Alright. Firstly you light these two
                    ends. Then I will light the tip, making
                    the trifecta complete. Are you ready?
          
          Dale nods and they light the joint. Saul tokes hard;
          plumes of smoke fill the air as he bursts into a COUGHING
          FIT.
          
                                 DALE
                    Holy...
          
          Dale takes the joint and hits it, exploding into a
          coughing fit.
          
                                 SAUL

                    And that, combined with the pineapple
                    weed, and the cross-joint  COUGH  you're
                    a good thirty to forty times higher. I
                    don't know the exact math, but, pff,
                    you're pretty fucking gong-showed. You
                    know what I mean?
          
          Saul takes a toke. Dale coughs HARDER and HARDER. He
          seems like he might throw up.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    It's crazy. The better the weed, the more
                    I wish I could think of how to explain
                    what's so good about it, but the...uh,
                    the better it is, the less shit I can
                    think of in total, you know?                         
          
          Saul passes Dale the joint, obliviously dropping ash all
          over his suit. Slightly agitated, Dale brushes it off.
          
                                  SAUL (CONT'D)

          Dale passes the join to Saul.

                    school guys these days. They're all                
                    roided out and going to Harvard. Even on           
                    my best days, I look like a fat, dumb              
                    piece of shit next to them.                        
          
                                 SAUL                                  
                    Whatever, man. It sounds like you got it           
                    pretty good. I wish I had a job that               
                    easy. Fuck.

                    Dude...you've got, like, the actual                 
                    easiest job in the world.                           
          
                                 SAUL                                   
                    Hey! You're right, man. I never thought             
                    of it like that.                                    
          
                                 DALE                                   
                    You can actually do whatever the hell you           
                    want. You get to sleep all day and people           
                    come buy weed at night.                             
          
          Dale passes Saul the joint.                                   
          
                                 SAUL                                   
                    That's totally true. Except tomorrow.               
                    Thanks to that bitch daylight savings, I            
                    gotta go change my grandma's clocks
                    forward at 7am. Or 8am. I seriously can't
                    figure it out.
          
                                 DALE
                    Sorry to hear that.
          
          Saul passes Dale the joint.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Yo, so, like, what have these people done
                    that you go after?
          
                                 DALE
                    Let's see...tonight I'm going after-
          
          Dale pulls a blue envelope out of his pocket.
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)
                    Ted Jones. He forgot to pay his-
          
                                 SAUL
                    Dude! My guy, Red, gets his weed from a
                    Ted Jones. He's, like, #1 supplier in
                    town. Maybe it's him!
          
                                 DALE
                    I doubt that, man. There's probably a lot
                    of Ted Joneses's out there.                         
          
                                 SAUL
                    Yeah, but not like this one, man! He's
                    what I want to be one day. He's like the
                    "Jesus of Weed". So...I guess he's like
                    Jah. Or Scarface.
          
                                                                    20
          
          
          
          Saul points to his Scarface poster. The joint ends. After
          a few moments it seems as though their ability to have a
          conversation burnt out with the joint. They sit in
          awkward silence. Dale gets up.                                  
          
                                 DALE
                    Well Saul, that was crazy. Thanks.
          
                                 SAUL
                    No worries dude, peace.
          
          They slap each other five and Dale exits. Saul turns on
          the TV. Saved By the Bell is on. It makes Saul chuckle.
          
          
          INT. DALE'S CAR - NIGHT
          
          Dale cruises down side streets and locates Ted's house.
          It is a large well-to-do home. Having difficulties, Dale        
          parks in between two cars across the street. He turns off
          the engine and starts smoking a joint. SUDDENLY - FLASH!        
          Two head lights appear up the street. Holy shit! It's a         
          COP CAR!
          
          He sits still, holding the joint between his legs as the
          cop car drives past and...parks a few cars down! The
          FEMALE COP walks up the block - TOWARDS DALE'S CAR!
          
                                 DALE                                     
                    Oh shit on me.                                        
          
          Fortunately,   the COP crosses the street and walks towards     
          Ted's house.   Confused, Dale watches as she is let in.         
          Dale waits a   moment and then re-lights the joint. He          
          tries to see   into Ted's house as he takes a MASSIVE TOKE.
          
          BANG! A SILENCE SHATTERING BLAST comes from Ted's house.
          Dale holds the toke in and tries to keep quiet as he
          focuses on the large front window. SUDDENLY, the drapes
          are torn down by an ASIAN MAN as he falls forwards and          
          crashes through the front window!                               
          
          Dale watches in horror as a LARGE GREY-HAIRED MAN and the
          Female Cop step forward and shoot the Asian man! BLAM!          
          BLAM! Blood splatters!                                          
          
          Dale starts COUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY! He starts the car
          and, in a panicked fit, tries to pull out. CRASH!!! He
          smashes directly into the car in front of him! He flicks
          the roach out onto the grass and slams the car in reverse
          - CRUNCH!!! He backs into the car behind him! Still
          hacking his lungs out, Dale drives away!                        
          
                                                                    21
          
          
          
          The Grey-Haired Man and the Female Cop sprint out of the
          house in time to see Dale's distant tail lights vanish
          into the darkness. Something catches the Grey-Haired
          Man's eye - a trail of smoke rising from the grass. He
          lowers his blood-stained hand and picks up...DALE'S
          ROACH! He brings it to his nose and sniffs, then rips           
          open the paper and examines the weed closely.

          INT. SAUL'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Saul is laying on his couch watching Saved By the Bell,
          laughing so hard that he's crying.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Ha! Ha! Ha! Screech.                                  
          
          Suddenly, the BUZZER sounds repeatedly.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                           (mumbles)
                    Fucking hell.
          
          He grudgingly walks to the intercom and presses talk.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    Hello?
          
          He presses listen.
          
                                 DALE (O.C.)
                           (through intercom)
                    ...me in! Let me in! Let me in!    Let me
                    in! It's Dale! Let m--
          
          Saul casually presses the talk button.
          
                                 SAUL
                           (annoyingly casual)
                    Denton? Dale Denton?
          
          He smiles to himself, then presses listen.
          
                                 DALE (O.C.)
                           (through intercom)
                    ...the love of shit, let me in! Pleeea-
          
          Annoyed, Saul buzzes him in and unlocks the door.
          
                                                                   22
          
          
          
                                 SAUL
                           (to himself)
                    ...fucking, don't smoke that shit if you
                    can't handle it.
          
          A moment later, Dale, completely freaking out, BURSTS
          through the door and SLAMS it shut.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                           (startled)

                                 DALE
                    He fucking killed him, man!
          
                                 SAUL
                    Be quiet, man, I got neighbors-
          
                                 DALE
                           (quietly)
                    He killed him!
          
                                  SAUL
                           (loud)
                    Somebody killed somebody?!?
          
                                 DALE
                    Yeah, man! I can't believe it. A cop! A
                    lady, and a guy.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Somebody killed a cop, a lady and a guy?
          
                                 DALE
                    No! A guy!
          
                                 SAUL
                    A cop killed a guy?
          
                                 DALE
                    No! A cop and a guy killed   another guy!
                    The lady and the guy...No,   a fucking
                    woman, a police woman, and   an old guy,
                    shot a guy, a younger guy,   in the fucking
                    window at Ted's house!
          
                                 SAUL
                    Was the guy Ted?
          
                                 DALE
                    Which guy?
          
                                                                 23
          
          
          
                                 SAUL
                    I don't know, the old guy who shot the
                    guy?
          
                                 DALE
                    I don't fucking know. He was this big,
                    old, grey haired guy with a gun, and he
                    fucking took him, and he shot him! Right
                    there in the fucking window! BAM!
          
                                 SAUL
                    I heard Ted's got grey hair!
          
                                 DALE
                    And they saw me! They saw me see them
                    shoot the guy!
          
          Saul jumps to his feet.
          
                                 SAUL
                    What!?! They saw you?!? Why the fuck did
                    you come here? Did they follow you?!?
          
          Saul dashes to the window and peeks out.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    Did they follow you here!?!
          
                                 DALE
                    No! I panicked. I was having a coughing
                    fit, I crashed, I crashed into a car.
                    Fuck, two cars. They must've heard at
                    least. They knew someone was there.
          
                                 SAUL
                    But they don't know it's you?
          
                                 DALE
                    No. I don't think so. No.
          
                                 SAUL
                    So...they're not coming here?
          
          Dale shakes his head, on the verge of tears. Saul shrugs,
          sits back down, then picks up his joint and re-lites it.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    Cool. So, what's your game-plan? You
                    gonna call the cops? Cause if you do, I'd
                    appreciate it if you left my shit out of
                    this shit.
          
                                                                   24
          
          
          
                                 DALE
                    I'm not calling the cops - one of them
                    was a cop. They could all be cops!                   
          
                                 SAUL
                    Did you see any blood? Was it sick?
          
                                 DALE
                    Yeah. I saw some blood.
          
                                 SAUL
                    I wonder who the guy he shot was?
          
                                 DALE
                    I don't know, who do drug dealers kill?
                    It was probably another drug dealer. He
                    was Asian. Are there Asian drug dealers.
          
                                  SAUL
                    Hell yeah, man. The Koreans teamed up
                    with, like, the Vietnamese or some shit.
                    They're crazy mother fuckers. Number two
                    in town.
                           (beat)
                    Heh. Ted's cappin' the competition. Yo,
                    you want some of this?
          
          Saul passes Dale the joint. Dale takes the joint and           
          frantically smokes as he paces.                                
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)                           
                    So, like, exactly what was the sequence
                    of happenings?
          
                                 DALE                                    
                    I'm sitting across from Ted's smoking a
                    massive joint of that weed you sold me-
          
                                 SAUL
                    Oh, the Pineapple Express. It's so rare
                    it's almost a shame to smoke it, like
                    killing a unicorn...with, like, a bomb.              
          
                                 DALE
                    When I threw it...out...the window...                
          
          Dale stops pacing and stares at Saul. He then looks down       
          at the joint of pineapple weed. Saul notices wheels
          turning in Dale's head.
          
                                 SAUL
                    What?
          
                                                                  25
          
          
          
          Dale continues staring at the joint.
          
                                 DALE
                    This weed is actually that rare?
          
                                 SAUL
                           (proudly)
                    Yeah, it's like, "the rarest".
          
                                 DALE
                    So, you are actually the only guy in town
                    with this weed?
          
                                 SAUL
                    Fuckin' rights, I am. Red told me he was
                    giving me an "exclusive sneak preview".
          
                                 DALE
                    And am I the only guy you gave it to?
          
                                 SAUL
                    Yeah. So, we're the only guys.
          
                                 DALE
                    But, like, another dealer, couldn't
                    identify it, the pineapple weed? Like, if
                    they found a roach of it, right?
          
          Saul thinks for a moment.
          
                                 SAUL
                    I could. Why?
          
                                 DALE
                           (panicking)
                    We should go, we shouldn't be here! We
                    should go!
          
                                 SAUL
                    No...seriously, why?
          
                                 DALE
                    I left a roach of this weed in front of
                    Ted's house!
          
                                 SAUL
                    So what? I leave roaches all over fucking
                    town.
          
                                                                    26
          
          
          
                                 DALE
                    No, listen - they could find the roach
                    and say, "This is pineapple weed, Saul's
                    the only guy in town who has pineapple
                    weed, therefore he must have witnessed
                    the murder or know who did - let's go
                    kill him."
          
          Finally, Saul understands.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Mother of fuck!
          
          He SPRINGS to his feet and BOLTS for the door.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    Let's go!
          
          Dale grabs Saul and stops him.
          
                                 DALE
                    Wait!
          
                                 SAUL
                    Why!?! Let go of me! Let's get the fuck
                    out of here!
          
                                 DALE
                    Saul, wait! Grab anything we might need,
                    like your weed and money and stuff.                   
          
          Saul grabs his bag of weed and shoves it in his backpack.
          They run for the door.
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)
                    Are you sure you're not forgetting
                    anything?
          
                                 SAUL
                    Yes! Come on!
          
          
          INT. SAUL'S APARTMENT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Saul and Dale run to the elevator and frantically press
          the button, terrified for their lives.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Fuck! I forgot something!
          
          Saul runs back to his apartment, leaving Dale alone and
          frightened. Saul BURSTS back out of his apartment holding
          his cell.
          
                                                                    27
          
          
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    Dude, I was so scared going back, I
                    thought there was gonna be guys there,
                    and then you'd be gone, and there was
                    this music in my head-
          
                                 DALE
                    We'll take the stairs, it'll be faster.
          
          They scramble towards the distant stairwell. Almost at
          the door, they hear the DING of the elevator arriving.
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)
                    Go back! Go back!
          
          They DASH back to the elevator. Dale shoves his arm
          between the doors and they hop in. Saul rapidly presses
          the LOBBY button as the doors shut. They're both on the
          verge of hyperventilating.
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)
                    Okay, man. We gotta try to relax.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Why?!?
          
                                 DALE
                    We don't want to draw attention.
          
                                 SAUL
                           (freaking out)
                    Whose attention!?! You think they could
                    be down there? In the Lobby? Right now!?!
          
                                 DALE
                    I don't know! Who knows? Just try to be
                    cool.
          
           DING  The elevator SUDDENLY STOPS on the second floor.
          
                 DALE (CONT'D)                     SAUL
          Oh my god!!!                  Ahhh!!!
          
          The doors OPEN! There's no one there. The doors close.
          
                                 SAUL
                    What the fuck was that?
          
                                 DALE
                    That was bad - Calm! Calm! Calm!
          
          The elevator stops at the lobby and the doors open, they
          step out, bumping into two rough looking guys.                  
          
                                                                   28

                    Oh. Pardon.
          
          Dale and Saul quickly leave as the bikers enter the
          elevator.
          
          
          INT. SAUL'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
          
          The rough looking guys, BUDLOFSKY and MATHESON, kick in        
          Saul's door and dash into the room, guns drawn. Matheson       
          spots a smoldering joint in the ashtray.
          
                                  MATHESON                               
                    Look.
          
          Budlofsky whips out his cell and hits speed dial.              
          
                                 BUDLOFSKY                               
                    Ted? He's gone, but he was just here. I              
                    think he knew we were coming.

          Dale peels out of his spot and down the road.
          
                                 DALE
                    Okay, what do you know about Ted?
          
                                 SAUL
                    What? Ted? Nothing. For all I know he's
                    tracking us with space satellites right
                    now! He's got grey hair, that's all I
                    knew.
          
          Saul checks behind them.

                    Well, how much money do you have?
          
          While Dale gets out his wallet, Saul opens Dale's change
          tray. It's full of roaches.

          The car is parked on a small dirt path in the moon-lit
          woods. Dale paces back and forth as Saul walks over.
          
                                 DALE
                    So what do we know? Nothing. We may or
                    may not be followed because we don't even            
                    know if he found the roach or not. And,
                    we could just be completely crazy. But,
                    the question is this: even if he found
                    the roach, how could he know where you
                    were?
          
                                 SAUL
                           (thrilled)
                    He couldn't. Cause I'm in the woods. It's
                    impossible! Unless he's, like, hanging on
                    the bottom of the car or some shit, but I            
                    mean-
          
                                                                  30
          
          
          
                                 DALE
                    No, what I mean is, if Ted found the
                    roach and identified the weed, how could
                    he connect it to you?
          
                                 SAUL
                    There's no way. He could only find out
                    from Red.
          
                                 DALE
                    Who is this Red guy?                                
          
                                 SAUL
                    Red's pretty much a middleman between Ted
                    and guys like me. And we're mad fucking
                    tight. One time he convinced some girl he
                    knew to give me a hand-job within, like,
                    five minutes of me meeting her.
          
                                 DALE
                    But let's say someone calls asking who he
                    sold this pineapple weed to, he'll say
                    you, because...why wouldn't he?
          
                                 SAUL
                    Fuck that. That's bullshit. He would have
                    called me if that happened. A hand-job,
                    Dale! Imagine if I'd gotten you a hand              
                    job by now!                                         
          
                                 DALE                                   
                    Yeah, but Saul, he's a fucking drug                 
                    dealer.                                             
          
                                 SAUL                                   
                    So? I'm a fuckin' drug dealer. What, you            
                    don't trust me then?                                
          
          Saul stares at Dale, who doesn't know how to respond.         
          
                                 DALE                                   
                    Um...I...call him. Yeah, sure, call him.            
          
                                 SAUL                                   
                    Thank you!                                          
          
          Pleased, Saul pats Dale on the back.                          
          
                                 DALE
                    You're right. You are. I'm just being               
                    paranoid. Sorry, dude.                              
          
                                                                   31
          
          
          
          Saul takes his cell phone out and presses speed dial. We
          hear someone pick up.
          
                                 RED (O.S.)
                           (through phone)
                    Ow! Hello?
          
                                 SAUL
                    Yo, Red. You okay man?
          
                                 RED (O.S.)
                    Saul! Oh. I, uh...stubbed my toe.
          
          Red sounds nervous.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Dude, watch the toes. Wear shoes in the
                    house. But Red, I gotta get straight to
                    brass tacs, I need a favor.
          
                                 RED (O.S.)
                    Sure man, anything. I'm Red.
          
                                 SAUL
                    You sure as fuck are, buddy. So, you know
                    how you gave me some of that pineapple
                    express stuff? Don't tell anyone you gave
                    it to me.
          
                                 RED (O.S.)
                    Sure man, no problem. Red swears it,
                    hombre.
          
                                 SAUL
                    So, can I come on over now?
          
          Dale waves his hands in front of Saul's face.
          
                                 DALE
                           (louldy whispering)
                    No! We should do it tomorrow!
          
                                  SAUL
                           (covering phone, talks to
                            Dale)
                    I'm in the middle of a convo, man. Let's
                    just go and get this shit over with.
          
                                 DALE
                    Come on, man. Tomorrow. I'm scared
                    shitless. I want to think things through
                    before I do anything. Let's go in the
                    morning. Please.
          
                                                                    32
          
          
          
          Saul looks around the dark forest.
          
                                    SAUL
                       Yeah...okay. Less scary shit happens in
                       the day.
          
          Dale nods.
          
                                    SAUL (CONT'D)
                              (into phone)
                       Red?

                              (talking to someone else)
                       -I can hear him talking to someone, so-
                       Yo! Saul? So, you're gonna come by in the
                       morning?
          
                                    SAUL
                       Yeah, right after I see my grandma.
          
                                    RED (O.S.)
                       Sure, your Grandma's retirement home- Ow!
                       Fuckin' stupid god-damn toe. I, uh, is
                       that the one on Granville and 41st.
          
                                    SAUL
                       Yeah man. I've only got one. So, we'll be
                       chillin' by noon.
          
          Saul gives Dale the thumbs up.
          
                                    RED (O.S.)
                       Well, cool brother. Noon it is.
          
                                    SAUL
                       We should definitely hit up the casino
                       again sometime.
          
                                    RED (O.S.)
                       For sure. We should definitely hit up the
                       casino.
          
          Saul hangs up the cell.
          
                                    SAUL
                       Nice. Now let's do some fucking stone
                       cold chilling. I'll role a jigga, on the           
                       house.

                    say?
          
                                 RED
                           (incredibly afraid)
                    I didn't say shit, man! There was another
                    guy there and he said tomorrow!

                    Why did he mention the casino? The Asians
                    run the casinos. Is Saul Asian?

          EXT. FOREST - CONTINUOUS                                        
          
                                 SAUL
                    I always liked smoking weed in the                    
                    forest.                                               
          
          Saul lights a joint and starts smoking. He passes it to         
          Dale. Dale puffs. They look around at their expansive,          
          dark surroundings and immediately become overwhelmed with       
          paranoia. Saul notices a shooting star zip across the sky       
          as Dale takes out his cell phone.                               
          
                                 DALE
                    I'm going to go call Angie. Make up some
                    bull shit.
          
          As Dale dials, Saul, paranoid from the pot, looks at his
          cell phone. He takes another hit, and then looks up to
          the sky again. He looks back at Dale's phone. Dale starts
          to walk off.
          
                                                                    34
          
          
          
                                   SAUL
                    Dale...wait!
          
          Saul snubs out the joint and runs over to Dale.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    Yeah, the phone...I mean, I don't know
                    how this shit works, but...can cops...
                    you said they might be cops...could they
                    triangulate our phones or trace `em or
                    some shit like that? I don't know. I feel
                    like I've seen that.
          
          Dale stares at Saul, then flips open his phone -  beep 
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    I mean, shit Dale, maybe they can trace
                    them when we're not even on them!
          
          Dale takes a hit as he looks up to the sky. Just then, a
          loud rumbling noise is heard.
          
                                 DALE
                    What the fuck is that?!
          
          The rumbling gets louder.
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)
                    Are we on fucking "Lost"?! What the hell
                    is that?!
          
                                   SAUL
                    It's them!!!
          
          The noise builds to a deafening crescendo as the guys
          dive behind a tree stump. A moment later, a JUMBO JET
          buzzes overhead, heading towards the nearby airport. Dale
          and Saul pop up.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    Holy fuck. That was close.

                           (clutching cell phone)
                    You know what? You're right. We should
                    just get rid of them. We should just
                    smash `em.
          
          Dale looks at his phone, which is a new, expensive Razor.
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)
                    Fuck. I just bought this thing. Maybe I
                    can just take the batteries out?

                    No! Smash it!
          
          Dale sighs, then SMASHES his phone on a rock. Saul looks
          at Dale, then HURLS his phone into the woods as hard as
          he can, sending it SAILING into the FOREST.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)

                    What the fuck was that?!
          
          Dale tosses the joint aside.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Fuck! I was trying to throw it at that

                    That one.
          
          Saul points out a group of trees about 30 feet away.

                    It was a cheap piece of shit. Came free
                    with the plan. It must've smashed when it
                    landed.

          They look into the scary dark depths of the woods. Both
          of them are clearly terrified.

          Horrified, they cautiously inch into the forest.

          Dale looks in horror as Saul vanishes amongst the trees.

                    ARGHHH!!!
          
          Dale hears a loud THUD.
          
          Scared for his life, he SPRINTS in the opposite
          direction! He weaves in between the trees, avoids some
          rocks and tree roots, stumbles on some loose dirt, then
          SLAMS half his body against a tree and FALLS HARD.
          
          ANGLE ON: SAUL
          
          Saul gets up, covered in dirt. Panting, he looks around
          the forest and sees no one. He thinks he hears something
          and SPRINTS off! WHAM! He trips on a tree root and SLAMS
          into the ground.
          
                                                                    38
          
          
          
          ANGLE ON: DALE
          
          Dale stumbles to his feet while futilely trying to wipe
          the dirt off his suit.
          
                                 DALE
                    Shit.
          
          Saul hears Dale and whips around, breaking a twig -
           CRACK 
          
          Dale looks towards the noise, then SPRINTS off.
          
          Saul hears someone and BOLTS in the opposite direction.
          
          Like chickens with their heads cut off, they both
          scramble through the woods trying to evade their
          imaginary enemies.
          
          Dale spots his car! He jumps in and SLAMS the door shut.
          He's about to turn the ignition, but stops. Panting and
          wheezing, he sinks into his seat.
          
          BAM! Something slams into the car.

          Dale and Saul start rolling separate joints.                    
          
                                                                   40
          
          
          
          
          INT. DALE'S CAR - THE NEXT DAY
          
          Dale slowly wakes up. He stretches, and then shakes Saul.
          
                                 DALE
                    Saul. Saul. Get up. Wake up.
          
          Saul opens his eyes and realizes where he is.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Fuck me.
          
                                 DALE
                    What's the time?
          
                                 SAUL
                           (groggy)
                    It's too early.
          
          Saul brings his wrist up close to his eyes.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    It's...
          
          Saul stares at his watch, confused.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    This can't be right.
          
                                 DALE
                    What does it say?
          
                                 SAUL
                    It says, uh...
          
          Saul looks outside towards the sun.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    It couldn't be three in the morning,

                                 DALE
                    It's three o'clock!?! We were supposed to
                    be there at noon!

                                 SAUL
                    -I didn't go to my Grandma's! Fuck! And
                    we've gotta call Red.
          
                                  DALE
                            (angry)
                    How?
          
          Dale digs in his pockets for the keys.
          
                                 SAUL
                    We'll find a pay pho...fuck! His number
                    was in my phone!
          
          Dale notices the keys are in the ignition.
          
                                 DALE
                    You remember where he lives, right?
          
                                 SAUL
                    Yes, I remember. What the hell is that
                    supposed to mean? Are you insinuating I'm
                    forgetful? That's right, I know the word
                    insinuating.
          
                                 DALE
                    Let's just get out of here.
          
          He turns the keys. NOTHING. He tries again. NOTHING.
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)
                    What the fuck? Come on.
          
          He tries twice more, but nothing happens.

                           (pissed off)
                    I think the battery's dead.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Are you fucking serious?
          
          He tries again.
          
                                  DALE
                    It's dead.
          
                                  SAUL
                    It's dead?

          Dale shoots Saul an angry look.                               
          
                                  SAUL (CONT'D)                         
                     What the fuck happened? How did this
                     happen?
          
                                  DALE
                     How? We fell asleep!                               
          
                                  SAUL                                  
                     Yeah. With your stupid talk radio. No              
                     surprise, that stuffs, like, made to put           
                     people to sleep.                                   
          
          Frustrated, Dale tries to gather his thoughts.
          
                                  DALE
                     We gotta...let's just...we'll walk. We'll          
                     walk to a road and hitchhike to Red's.
          
                                 SAUL
                     For real?
          
          Dale opens his door and hops out.
          
                                  DALE
                     Yeah, "for real". We'll be late, but               
                     we'll get there. Then we can fix this
                     insane situation.
          
          MONTAGE:                                                      
          
          - Dale and Saul walk down a seemingly unused forest road,     
          each smoking their own joint.                                 
          
          - Saul points out a giant caterpillar crawling on a leaf.
          Dale is grossed out. Saul pokes the caterpillar and then
          blows weed smoke onto it.
          
                                  DALE (CONT'D)                         
                     Stop fucking around, man. Come on. Leave           
                     that thing alone.                                  
          
          - They emerge at the highway and try to hitch a ride.
          
          - Dale notices Saul has his thumb sticking out of his         
          zipper.
          
                                  SAUL
                     It's like, my thumb is my cock!
          
          Dale doesn't laugh.                                           
          
                                                                    43
          
          
          
          - Bored and tired, they wait.   Saul lights a joint. Dale       
          notices. Saul shifts his body   away from Dale. Just then,      
          an eighteen wheeler slows for   them. Saul snubs out the
          freshly lit joint and puts it   in his pocket.
          
          
          EXT. RED'S HOUSE - LATER                                        
          
          Dale and Saul get out of the eighteen wheeler.
          
                                 SAUL
                           (to the driver)
                    Thanks a fucking ton, Sharid.
          
          Saul shuts the door and he and Dale run towards Red's           
          house - a small, dilapidated place in a rundown part of         
          town. Exhausted, Dale and Saul reach Red's door. Saul           
          knocks.
          
                                 DALE
                    So, what's this guy like?
          
                                 SAUL
                    I don't know. He's short...and stout. So
                    he's like a tea pot. Hehe.
          
                                 DALE
                    Well, do you think he'll be there?
          
                                  SAUL
                    I don't know, I mean, we are only...eight
                    hours late.

                    That's actually pretty late.                          
          
                                 RED (O.S.)
                           (through door)
                    Who is it?
          
                                 SAUL
                    Red! It's Saul. Open up.
          
          Red opens the door. He has a SPLIT LIP and has clearly
          been CRYING. He tries to act normal. Dale immediately
          suspects something is up.
          
                                 RED
                           (sniffling)
                    Who's this guy?
          
                                 DALE
                    Dale. Nice to meet you.

          Red ushers them in and shuts the door.
          
                                   RED
                    Dale who?
          
                                   DALE
                    I think it's    better if you don't know my           
                    last-                                                 
          
                                 SAUL
                           (oblivious)
                    Dale Denton. He's with me. No worries.                
          
          Red notices their dirty clothes.
          
                                 RED
                           (to Saul)
                    What happened to your clothes? Where'd
                    you call me from, man?
          
          Dale notices Red quivering as he lights a cigarette and
          becomes increasingly suspicious.
          
                                 SAUL
                    We were in the forest laying low.

                    Uh, Red...what...uh, is your lip okay?
          
          Saul finally notices Red's dishevelled appearance.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Whoa! Dude, have you been crying?

                    What? Oh, I uh...
                           (feeling his split lip)
                    ...I got a cold sore, I've never got one
                    before. I started crying.
          
                                 SAUL
                    A cold sore? Is that fucking herpes?
          
                                 RED
                    ...uh, yeah, man.

                     (to Dale)
          Okay, Captain Demando. Can you just chill
          out, maybe? So, Red. I gotta ask-
          
                       RED
          Okay, first of all, stop. What's this all
          about? That's what I want to know.
          
                       SAUL
          Alright. Well, Dale's a servant for
          protest lawyers, and-                                
          
                       DALE
          Whoa, whoa! Saul, I don't think...well,
          Red, I don't mean to be rude but I don't
          think we should tell you any more than
          you need to know.
          
                       RED
          Fuck that, Dale. This is my house, I
          deserve to know.
          
                       SAUL
          Dude! Let's just tell him. It is his
          house.
          
                       DALE
          Look. Red, I just don't want to pull you
          into the shit we're in. It's just
          trouble.
          
                       SAUL
          Don't be weird about this. If he wants
          trouble, it's his right to have it.
          
                       RED
          Whoa! Whoa! I don't want trouble.
          
                       DALE
          That's why we only need to clarify one
          thing - nobody's called about Saul or the
          pineapple express or anything like that?
          
                       RED
          No one. Nada.
          
                                                                   46
          
          
          
                                 SAUL
                    Awesome! Look at that! Everything's fine.
                    We had a crazy night in the woods, which             
                    I assume we can both put behind us like              
                    grown ups, and now we can use Red's giant            
                    bong to get super-duper high.                        
          
          Dale doesn't seem convinced. Saul picks up Red's huge          
          bong and starts to pack a bit of Red's weed into it.           
          
                                 RED                                     
                    Alright, well, wicked. Make yourselves at
                    home. I'm just going to use the ol'
                    telephone-o.                                         
          
          Saul sits down and picks up a lighter as Red walks             
          towards the phone. Dale watches Red, suspicious of his         
          odd behavior. Red begins to dial...
          
          SMACK! Dale knocks the phone out of Red's hand.
          
                                 RED (CONT'D)
                    What the fuck!
          
          Saul jumps up. Dale SNATCHES the phone and backs up.
          
                                 DALE
                    I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
          
                                  SAUL
                    Dale!   What the fuck are you doing?
          
                                 DALE
                           (to Saul)
                    We can't let him call anyone! He's acting
                    weird!
          
                                 RED
                    Fuck you man - this is my house!                     
          
                                 DALE
                    I'm sorry. I just, I don't think I can-
          
                                 SAUL
                    Dale! You fucking nut. You're stoned and
                    paranoid. Just chill the shit out, guy!
                           (to Red)                                      
                    I'm sorry, Red. I shouldn't have brought             
                    this guy over here, he's a total lunatic.            
          
          Without warning, Red grabs a LARGE ASHTRAY filled with
          cigarette butts and WHIPS it at Dale. BAM! It smashes him
          in the head!!!
          
                                                                    47
          
          
          
                                 DALE
                           (in pain)
                    AAAHHH!
          
          Ash EXPLODES everywhere as Dale drops the phone and
          clutches his head.
          
                                   SAUL
                    Holy cock!
          
          Red approaches the cowering Dale. Saul intercedes.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    Dude! He's sorry! Wait!
          
          Red PUNCHES Saul in the face! Saul SCREAMS and drops to
          the ground.
          
                                   SAUL (CONT'D)
                    WHY!?!?!
          
          Dale snatches the phone and scurries into the bathroom,
          slamming the door behind him.
          
          
          INT. RED'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Disoriented, Dale scans the small bathroom. Saul and Red
          can be heard fighting outside.
          
                                 SAUL (O.S.)
                    Dude, we're friends, what the fuck is                 
                    wrong with you? Ow! Dude! Are you fucked              
                    off that shit again!?! Ow!                            
          
                                 RED (O.S.)
                    I have to! They'll kill me!!! Please                  
                    don't fight!                                          
          
          A loud CRASH is heard from the other room.
          
                                   SAUL                                   
                    AAAHHHHHH!!!                                          
          
          Dale throws the phone in the toilet bowl and smacks down
          the seat. He runs back to help Saul.
          
          
          INT. RED'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
          
          Red is BEATING the shit out of Saul.
          
                                                                    48
          
          
          
                                 SAUL                                     
                    Why, man!?! Why!                                      
          
                                   RED                                    
                    I'M SORRY!!!                                          
          
          Saul manages to stand up when Red boots him in the BALLS!
          He SHRIEKS and stumbles backwards. Dale dashes into the
          room and LEAPS onto Red's back. Red wobbles forward, then       
          starts RUNNING BACKWARDS. He trips on his coffee table
          and CRASHES Dale through it, landing on top of him. Red         
          gets up, sprints into the bathroom and locks the door.
          With great effort, Dale and Saul manage to get up.
          
                                 DALE                                     
                    He's going for the phone! Bathroom!                   
          
          
          INT. RED'S APARTMENT/BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Frantically searching for the phone, Red flips the toilet
          seat up and grabs it. He begins to dial as Dale and Saul
          sprint down the hall.
          
          Just as Red is about to finish dialing, Dale and Saul
          CRASH into the bathroom door! They knock it completely
          off it's hinges, SLAMMING it directly into Red! The phone
          flies into the bathtub.
          
                                 DALE
                           (pointing at the phone)
                    SAUL!!! Phone!!!
          
          Saul jumps into the bathtub and begins STOMPING the
          phone. Dale continuously SLAMS his body against the door
          in an attempt to keep Red pinned down.
          
                                 SAUL
                    What the fuck Red!?! What the fuck is
                    going on!?!
          
                                 RED
                    I don't know!!! They're going to kill
                    me!!!
          
                                 SAUL
                    You didn't stub your toe, did you?
          
          Red stops struggling and tries to catch his breath. Dale
          kneels on top of the door, keeping him pinned.
          
                                   DALE
                    Now tell us-
          
                                                                   49
          
          
          
                                 RED
                    They're gonna come back and kill me!!!
          
          In an impressive show of strength, Red shoves the door
          off him, knocking Dale aside. He runs.
          
          
          INT. RED'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
          
          Saul chases Red and TACKLES him into a wall. Dale follows
          seconds later, and notices Red's LARGE GLASS BONG. He
          looks back to see Saul getting pummelled.
          
                                  SAUL                                   
                    DALE! HELP!                                          
          
          Dale grabs the bong and swings around - CRASH!!! It
          shatters on the back of Red's head.
          
          Red falls to the ground moaning, blood dripping from his
          head. Dale and Saul stand over him, out of breath,
          bruised and battered.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)                           
                    Red, you motherfucker.
          
          Dale, lost in thought, starts to seriously freak out.
          
                                 DALE
                    It's happening! It's actually happening!
                    He knows my name! Red knows my name!
          
                                 SAUL
                    We should beat it out of his sellout
                    brains. You're a shitty friend, Red! Fuck
                    the Casino! Go alone!
          
                                 DALE
                    This is fucked, what do we do now, he
                    knows my name!?!
          
                                 SAUL
                    He knows my name too!
          
                                 DALE
                    Well what do we do? He's gonna tell them!
          
                                 SAUL
                    We're not gonna have to kill him, are we?
                    I don't think I could do that.
          
          Dale stares at the almost motionless Red.
          
                                                                  50
          
          
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    Maybe we could talk him into killing
                    himself, or, like, make him promise not
                    to tell.
          
                                 DALE
                    Well, we have to find out what he knows.
          
                                 RED
                           (in great pain)
                    I don't know anything...you broke my
                    bong...
          
          Dale, trying to act tough, grabs Red by the collar.
          
                                 DALE
                    Tell us everything. Now!
          
          Red looks to Saul for sympathy.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Don't look at me, you sellout bastard.
                    Now start talking!
          
                                 RED
                    I can't...I don't know anything.
          
          Dale pulls Saul aside.
          
                                 SAUL
                    What do we do? He's not gonna talk.
          
                                 DALE
                    I think we beat it out of him.
          
                                   SAUL
                    For real?
          
                                 DALE
                    Okay. Red. Here's the deal: if you don't
                    tell us everything, we're going to beat
                    you up.

                    You've got five seconds, okay? Ready?
                    Five, four-

          Dale raises his fist.
          
                                 RED
                    Please don't.
          
                                 DALE
                    Three, two...one!
          
          Red cringes as Dale softly "punches" his gut. It doesn't
          hurt him.
          
                                 RED
                    That didn't hurt.
          
                                 SAUL

                    man. Like, fucking hit him!
          
          Dale takes a deep breathe and raises his fist.
          
                                 RED

          Dale grabs a potted plant.

          Dale swings the plant back to strike Red. The pot flies      
          off the plant and Dale smashes the dirt covered roots of     
          the plant against Red's face.

          Dale raises his fist.

                    show. They said they'd kill me if I

          Dale swings the PLANT upwards, prepared to strike Red          
          again.

                    calls them the Asians.
          
          Dale and Saul exchange an even more worried look.

                    where his duct tape is.
          
          Saul runs off. Dale puts on Saul's backpack and looks at
          the battered Red moaning on the floor.
          
                                                                    53

                    up.
          
          Dale pulls Red's hands behind his back. Saul is picking
          at the tape.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)

          Saul rips open the DUCT TAPE. He quickly BINDS Red's            
          hands and feet. SUDDENLY, there's a KNOCK at the door.          
          They stop, silent. KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. Red starts              
          thrashing and trying to scream.

                    Hey. What skin color were these guys?
          
                                 RED
                    What? Um...white, they're both white. I
                    think Denton might be a Jew, but I
                    couldn't really tell.
          
                                 MATHESON                                
                    You hear that, Ted?

                    Dale Denton. Not Asian. Alright. Kill
                    Red.
          
          Matheson pulls out a gun and shoots Red in the gut.

          TED (the big grey-haired guy) puts his portable phone
          back in its charger.

          The living room windows are covered by black sheets.
          Workers are busy scrubbing blood stains off the floor and       
          walls. The dead Asian man lies on top of bubble-wrap in
          the corner.
          
          Ted walks into the kitchen where CAROL BRAZIER (female
          cop from the murder, in full uniform, mid-30s) is playing
          with her gun.
          
                                 TED (CONT'D)                             
                    Carol, there's another name to run. Dale
                    Denton.
          
                                 CAROL
                    Does he have something to do with our
                    friend in there?
          
                                 TED
                    If the Asians have the balls to send an
                    assassin right into my home, we can't be
                    too cautious. The boys say Denton and
                    Saul are Caucasian. Maybe after their
                    assassin failed, they hired this outside              
                    guy Denton to finish the job.                         
                           (pondering)
                    Also, the boys said that Saul mentioned
                    "going to the casino."
          
                                 CAROL                                    
                    "Going to the casino"? I don't like that.
          
          Carol holsters her gun.

          an eavesdropping tool aimed at   Ted's house. They hear
          every word. One of them writes   down info in Korean.

          Dale and Saul get out of the cab in a pleasant                  
          neighborhood. Saul begrudgingly pays the driver. They           
          walk towards Angie's house.

          Angie opens the door with a smile, the phone in hand. Her
          attention is towards the phone conversation she is

                    - I saw a crooked cop kill a guy while I              
                    was working...this morning. The cop shot              
                    the guy then saw my car drive off, and I              
                    think they might have seen my license                 
                    plate and, so, I ditched my car...in the              
                    woods, so...                                          
          
          They stare at Dale as though he were crazy.

                    I know! Look, we have to get out of here.           
                    I'm sure everything is going to be fine

          Dale and Saul lead Angie and her parents towards the back     
          door.

          Budlofsky and Matheson are now at the front door. They've     
          each got a gun drawn and are preparing to burst in.           
          Budlofsky is loading his bullet cartridge.                    
          
                                                                    64

                    Ready?                                                
          
                                   BUDLOFSKY                              
                    No. One sec.                                          
          
          Budlofsky puts in the last few bullets.                         
          
                                 MATHESON                                 
                    Hurry the fuck up.                                    
          
                                 BUDLOFSKY                                
                    Chill out, man. You're nagging isn't                  
                    helping.                                              
          
          Budlofsky cocks his gun and nods at Matheson.                   
          
          
          INT. ANGIE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
          
          BAM! They kick open the doors and run into her house. No        
          one is there. Budlofsky cautiously walks over to the            
          table and touches the food. It's still warm. Matheson           
          bends down and picks up a bloody fork.                          
          
                                 MATHESON                                 
                    Ew! It's a bloody fork! What are these                
                    people doing?

          Dale, Angie, her parents, and Saul burst into the garage.       
          Robert is fumbling with the keys. He manages to open the        
          car. Saul pulls up his shirt to look at the stab wound.

          Ted and Carol are in mid-discussion, and rather
          distraught at that. Behind them two henchmen take the
          dead Asian man's body out the back door.

                    Maybe he killed her, to protect himself.

                    They smashed one and left the other one             
                    in the woods to distract us. Took us an             
                    hour to find it. And we found Denton's              
                    car, which was filled with all these

          Cheung, the leader of the Asians, has a lavish mansion
          which is covered in ornate decorations and expensive
          merchandise. It is immaculately clean and organized.
          Several armed men with earpieces stand in strategic
          locations throughout the house. Cheung is reading a
          Korean book alone in his study. The phone rings and he
          picks it up.

          Cheung sits up, shocked to have his opponent calling him.
          He snaps his fingers and two guards run in. He covers the
          phone.

                    Ted. This is surprising. What would you
                    like?

                    Cheung, I want you to call off your man
                    Denton. I don't know what he is, a scout,
                    assassin, and frankly I don't care. I
                    just want him gone. I want him dead. If
                    you do this, I'll consider it a peace
                    offering, otherwise, you're asking for
                    war. And just in case you forgot, I'm
                    number one, and there's a reason for
                    that. You've got 24 hours to reply.

                    Ted Jones is slipping. Our assassin                  
                    failed to kill him, but it did rattle his            
                    confidence. It's earlier than planned,               
                    but we should strike now, while he is

          EXT. PARK - NIGHT
          
          Dale and Saul are sitting in the branches of a tree. Fast      
          food wrappers lie scattered. Saul is rolling a joint.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Victory joint complete. Here ya go.
          
          Saul passes it to Dale, who lights it. Dale takes another
          puff and starts to seriously relax. A smile creeps across
          his face as he passes the joint to Saul.
          
                                 DALE
                    "Tell us what you know!" How fuckin'
                    balls was that?
          
          Saul takes a puff.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Like, really balls.
          
                                 DALE
                    And I think I fought pretty well, don't
                    you? You know, for my first time. We were
                    like Tango and Cash, man.
          
                                   SAUL

                    BOOM! Knocked the door right off it's
                    hinges!
          
          Saul passes the joint to Dale.
          
                                 SAUL
                    And you probably saved Angie, which is
                    fucking pimp.

                    I probably couldn't have done it without
                    you. Thanks, man. It is fucking pimp.

                    know.
          
          Saul passes the joint to Dale.
          
                                  DALE
                    Thanks, man.

                    You know, my last dealer was a total
                    dick. You're by far the coolest dealer
                    I've ever had.

                                 DALE
                    Yeah...like, the time before last time, I          
                    totally had weed. I just kind of wanted            
                    to chill with you.                                 
          
                                 SAUL
                           (over-joyed)
                    Really? That's awesome, man. That means a          
                    lot to me, `cause, like, plenty of dudes           
                    come in to buy and pretend to be all
                    buddy-buddy with me, but in my head I'm
                    always, like, "you don't like me, you
                    like my drugs, so fuck you, buddy!" You
                    know? And just so you know, I totally              
                    could have lit that cross-joint on my
                    own. I'd just have to use candles, but,
                    like, I've never smoked one of those with
                    anyone before.                                     
          
          Dale passes Saul the joint.                                  
          
                                 DALE
                    So, do you think we should leave town? We          
                    could just get on a bus and go, right?
          
                                 SAUL
                    We only have, like, fifty bucks. I don't
                    think that could even pay for one ticket.
          
          Saul rubs the roach out in the dirt.
          
                                                                 70

          Saul rubs his balls again.
          
                                 SAUL

          Blake passes the joint to Dale.

                    Alright gentlemen, it's time for me to
                    teach you some business. Brass tacs -
                    this is the best weed you've ever smoked,
                    agreed?
          
          The kids all nod in agreement.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    So I'm gonna make this simple. How much
                    did you get between you?
          
                                 BLAKE
                    A hundred and seventy eight.
          
          Saul pulls out his impressive bag of weed. The kids GASP.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Alright. You gimme all your money, you
                    can each take two handfuls of weed. That
                    treat ya right?
          
          The kids cheer as Desmond takes two BIG handfuls.
          
                                 DESMOND
                    That's fucking awesome!
          
                                 SAUL
                    I know. Keep it on the down low.
          
          They pay Dale and take their weed. Happy as hell, they
          run off, stuffing HANDFULS OF WEED into their pockets.
          
                                 ACK
                           (to Walt)
                    Jason'll never believe this...until I
                    show him all this weed!
          
          Dale holds the un-lit joint as Saul takes the pot and the
          money.
          
                                 SAUL
                    And we, my good man, are officially scott
                    fuckin' free.

                                 DALE
                    There are still people trying to kill us.          
          
                                 SAUL
                    But at least now we can afford to run.
                    I'm gonna go buy some celebration snacks.
                    Let's have us a little mardi-gras                  
                    fiesta.
          
          Saul laughs as he puts on his backpack and walks around
          the corner. Dale re-lights the remaining roach and           
          casually smokes. He blows some smoke rings, coughs a bit,
          stretches; for a few moments, looking completely relaxed,
          but then-
          
          A COP CAR screeches to a halt right in front of Dale! A
          female POLICE LIAISON OFFICER (who is not Carol) gets out
          of the car. Dale freezes in horror.
          
                                  POLICE LIAISON
                    Don't move!
          
          She walks towards Dale. He seems prepared to run, but she
          places her hand on a can of pepper spray.
          
                                 POLICE LIAISON (CONT'D)
                    Don't move! This stuff hurts. What's in
                    your hand?
          
                                 DALE.
                    I'm sorry, Ma'am. It's weed. I'll get rid
                    of it right away, I was just smoking
                    this. I...I thought it was
                    decriminalized. Or something. For medical
                    purposes. I have epilepsy.
          
                                 POLICE LIAISON
                    Selling pot to my students isn't
                    "decriminalized." I'm the liaison officer
                    for this school and I just caught four
                    students showing off handfuls of
                    marijuana to their friends. They told me
                    they got it back here. Put your hands up.
          
          She cuffs Dale's hands behind him!
          
                                 DALE
                    Wait! I wasn't selling anything! All I
                    have is this little joint.
          
          
          Police Liaison takes the large joint out of Dale's hand.
          
                                                                    75
          
          
          
                                 POLICE LIAISON
                    You call this little?
          
          She throws it on the ground and smears it around with her
          foot.
          
                                 DALE
                    I don't even have any money! How did I
                    sell weed if I don't have any money?!? I
                    was just smoking it. I swear. Please.
          
          She pats him down, finding only his wallet. The Police
          Liaison sees he only has nine dollars. She pulls out his
          DRIVER'S LICENSE.
          
                                 POLICE LIAISON
                    It's possible you're telling the truth.
                    I'm going to run a check and if it turns
                    out you don't have any priors and all
                    you've got is this small amount of
                    marijuana, I'll let you go with a fine.
                    Take a seat.
          
          She walks towards her car as Dale sits on the ground.
          
          ANGLE ON: Saul
          
          Saul merrily turns into the alley holding TWO RED
          SLURPEES, when he jumps back in terror! He sees the cop         
          car up the alley. He ducks back behind the corner.
          
                                 SAUL
                    They got Dale. Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh
                    fuck...
          
          ANGLE ON: Dale and the Police Liaison
          
          She looks at her car computer. The screen reads:
          
          DALE DENTON: OUTSTANDING WARRANT - DOUBLE HIT AND RUN.
          
          She looks back at Dale and types into her computer.
          
          
          INT. CAROL'S COP CAR - CONTINUOUS
          
          We see Carol (who is in fact Ted's evil accomplice)
          speeding down the road. Her police computer beeps. She
          looks at the screen.
          
                                 CAROL
                           (smiling)
                    Denton.

          EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS
          
          The Police Liaison stuffs Dale in the back of her squad
          car.
          
                                 DALE
                    What is this for? What did that thing
                    tell you? What did I do?
          
                                 POLICE LIAISON
                    Hit and run, Mr. Denton. A double,
                    actually. You hit two parked cars two
                    nights ago.
          
          A look of crippling horror comes across Dale's face as
          she throws him in the back seat and slams his door shut.
          
          ANGLE ON: Saul
          
          He peaks down the alley and sees Dale in the back of the
          car and the FEMALE Police Liaison getting in the front.
          
                                 SAUL
                    The lady cop. She's gonna kill him.
          
          The car slowly makes a three point turn.
          
          
          INT. COP CAR - CONTINUOUS
          
                                 DALE
                    You don't understand! You have to let me
                    go! Dirty cops are gonna kill me! Please!
          
          The Police Liaison ignores Dale.
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)
                    This...this lady cop, and these guys                  
                    Budlofsky and Matheson, they all work for

                           (suddenly interested)
                    Ted Jones?
          
                                 DALE
                    Yeah. With grey-hair. Tell me you know
                    what I'm talking about. He lives near
                    Evergreen Heights. He-

                                 POLICE LIAISON
                    Are you telling me you saw Ted Jones and
                    a police office shoot someone?
          
                                 DALE
                    Yeah. An Asian someone.
          
          The Police Liaison ponders as she finishes her three
          point turn and drives toward the exit of the alley.
          
                                 POLICE LIAISON
                    Stay calm, do as your told, I'll get you
                    down to the station.
          
                                 DALE
                           (ecstatic)
                    Yes ma'am.
          
          
          EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Saul peeks out and sees the approaching cop car. He looks
          at the two red slurpees and thinks, then suddenly jumps
          out and THROWS himself onto the hood of the cop car!
          
          The Police Liaison and Dale see a body SLAM against the
          car and RED LIQUID SPLATTER everywhere, covering the
          windshield. They SCREAM.
          
          WHAM! In the impact, we clearly see Saul's BALLS getting
          ROCKED on the car! The Police Liaison slams on the
          brakes, causing Dale to SMASH into the metal cage.
          
                                 POLICE LIAISON
                    Oh my god! Is that blood? Oh my god!
          
          She puts the car in park. As the Police Liaison gets out
          of her car, Saul can be seen crawling around the back of
          the vehicle, clutching his testicles. The frightened
          Police Liaison looks at the windshield.
          
          She notices the two slurpee cups on the ground and
          quickly turns around. She sees Saul jumping into the
          drivers seat.
          
          Saul sees a SHOTGUN beside the passenger seat. The Police
          Liaison reaches for her GUN!
          
                                 DALE
                    NO! What are you doing!?!
          
                                                                    78

                    Freeze mister! Don't even...
          
          Saul slams the car into reverse! He speeds backwards up
          the alley as the Police Liaison runs after them - GUN
          DRAWN!
          
                                 DALE
                    No! She was going to help us!
          
                                 SAUL
                           (in pain)
                    Oh...my balls...I seriously think I
                    popped one...
          
          Suddenly, Carol (the cop from Ted's house) whips her COP
          CAR into the alley! WHAM!!! It smashes into the rear of
          their car! Dale turns around and establishes eye contact
          with the stunned Carol.
          
                                 DALE
                           (horrified)
                    IT'S HER! The lady cop!
          
          Saul slams down the gas! Through the slurpee covered
          window Saul sees the Police Liaison rushing towards them.
          
                                 SAUL
                           (motion at the Police
                            Liaison)
                    Then who's that?
          
          The Police Liaison raises her gun.
          
                 SAUL (CONT'D)                      DALE
          NOOOO!!!                      AAAAH!!!
          
          BLAM! She fires and the bullet punches through the              
          windshield! The Police Liaison dives to the side as they        
          zoom past her! They burst out of the alley. A moment
          later, Carol follows, in hot pursuit.
          
          
          I/E. DALE AN SAUL'S STOLEN COP CAR - CONTINUOUS
          
          The car weaves through traffic.
          
                                 SAUL
                    The slurpee! I can't see!
          
                                                                    79
          
          
          
                                 DALE
                    Turn on the wipers!
          
          Saul mindlessly starts grasping at switches in the car.
          He finally turns on the wipers, which wipe away the
          slurpee and reveal that the window is so badly cracked he
          still can't see through it. Carol's car emerges right           
          behind them.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Dude, I seriously can't see!
          
                                 DALE
                    Kick out the window! Isn't that what they
                    do?
          
                                 SAUL
                    I don't know. Okay.
          
          Saul, with great effort, keeps one foot on the pedals
          and, with all his might, kicks his other leg through the
          front window. His leg PUNCHES straight through the glass,
          but he can't pull it back in!
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    Oh fuck! Shit!
          
                                 DALE
                    Get it out of there!
          
          Suddenly, their car gets jerked to the side.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Ah! Ah! My leg!
          
          Carol is ramming them from behind.
          
                                 DALE
                           (hysterical)
                    She's following us! She's gaining on us!
          
                                 SAUL
                    Her car's better!
          
          Saul yanks at his leg and manages to wriggle it out of
          the hole. He begins to accelerate and realizes he can see
          where he's going through the hole.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    Ha! I can see! Through my leg hole!
          
          Saul bumps over the curb and cuts through a LARGE PARK.
          Carol is right behind them.
          
                                                                    80
          
          
          
                                  DALE
                     Do something!
          
          Saul thinks hard, then buckles his seat belt.
          
                                  SAUL
                     Hold on. I've got an idea.
          
          Dale does what little he can to brace himself. Saul SLAMS
          on the breaks. Carol sees Saul screeching to a halt and         
          slams on her breaks. She grunts and whips out her GUN.          
          Both cars come to a full stop beside one another.               
          
          She opens fire - BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! - Bullets
          rip through the stolen cruiser. Shattered glass flies
          everywhere. Dale and Saul desperately duck for cover.
          
          Saul hits the gas and the bullet riddled car takes off.
          Carol follows.
          
                                  DALE
                     WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?!?!?
          
          Saul pops back up and begins steering again.
          
                                  SAUL
                     Oh shit, man! I'm sorry! I thought she'd
                     keep going.
          
          The car bumps back on to a main road. Carol follows,
          sirens blaring.
          
                                  DALE
                     Turn on the sirens!
          
          Saul's hand flails around, grasping everything. He feels
          the SHOTGUN and accidentally pulls the trigger-
          
          BOOM! The blast blows through the roof of the car and
          hits an overhead TRAFFIC LIGHT - shredding it to pieces!
          
                      SAUL                          DALE
          JESUS!!!                         SHIT!
          
          Carol flies into the intersection on a collision course
          with Saul and Dale.
          
          CRUNCH! A car smashes into the side of the Carol's
          cruiser.
          
          As Dale and Saul speed off, Carol emerges from the
          smoking wreckage, a look of hate in her eyes.
          
                                                                    81
          
          
          
          
          EXT. QUIET RESIDENTIAL STREET - MOMENTS LATER
          
          The stolen cruiser screeches to a halt and Saul hops out.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Run!
          
          He starts running up the block at top speed.
          
          Dale, still handcuffed in the back of the cruiser, starts
          thrashing and screaming.
          
                                 DALE
                    Saul! Saul! I'm locked in!
          
          Dale continues to scream as Saul obliviously bolts to the
          end of the block and just keeps going.
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)
                    You dumb fucking fuck!!! HELP ME!!!
          
          Dale sits in the car, helpless. He has a look of utter
          disbelief on his face. After a moment of silence he
          starts wildly kicking the door window. He soon gives up.
          
          Just then, Dale notices Saul, over a block away, running
          back towards the stolen car. Saul soon arrives,
          completely out of breath, and opens the door.
          
                                 SAUL
                    So... huff ... huff ...fuckin'
                    sorry... huff ...forgot...
          
          Dale flops out of the car and onto the grass. Saul tries
          to help him to his feet, but Dale pulls away.
          
                                 DALE
                    Don't touch me, you asshole!
          
          Dale wiggles to his feet runs for it. Saul follows.
          
          
          INT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY                                       
          
          Dale and Saul enter the hardware store, walking very            
          close together so that no one sees Dale is handcuffed.          
          They receive a few odd looks as they search and locate          
          what they are looking for: saws. Saul quickly finds a           
          sturdy looking hack-saw.                                        
          
                                                                    82

                    fast. Bend over.                                      
          
          Dale gets on his knees and bends over, pressing his face        
          up against the wall. Saul begins to manically hack away         
          at the cuffs.                                                   
          
                                 DALE                                     
                    Ow! Ow! Hurry!

          Suddenly, Saul sees a store clerk coming and shoves the         
          saw underneath Dale's suit jacket.                              
          
                                 DALE                                     
                    Which saw do you like most?                           
          
                                 SAUL                                     
                    The brown ones nice, but the metallic                 
                    ones seems more...                                    
          
          They watch the clerk walk off and immediately return to         
          sawing the handcuffs.

          Dale stretches his arms. The handcuffs are still on his         
          hands, but no longer attached.

                    Angie, no! No! Don't you get it? I was              
                    thrown into this situation, I had no                
                    control, but I am dealing with it. This             
                    kind of thing happens, you know-

                    that you think you're some kind of
                    fucking genius just makes it a hundred

          As Dale walks out of his phone booth, we see that Saul is    
          on the phone in the next booth and is also smoking from a    
          pipe.

                    Yo, so before we go on the lamb I gotta            
                    go see my grandma, okay? She was worried           
                    `cause I didn't show up to help with the           
                    locks. But before that I've got to smoke           
                    another bowl.

                    smoke marijuana?
          
                                 SAUL

                    How can you smoke marijuana after what we
                    just went through? That clearly happened
                    because we were smoking marijuana.
          
                                 SAUL
                    No. It happened because those fucking
                    kids didn't keep that shit on the down
                    low. Which is weird, `cause they really            
                    seemed like cool kids.

                    When I saved you with those Slurpees I
                    was stoned. What do you gotta say to
                    that? Maybe the pot is what gave me the
                    creative capacity to come up with such a
                    great plan! The Beatles were high!

          MUSIC UP: THE END by THE DOORS
          
          - Saul gets on a bus and sits down, sad and deject.           
          
          - Dale sits against the phone booth, crying like a baby.      
          He buries his hands in his pocket and pulls out his baggy     
          of weed. He hurls it away. He gets up to retrieve it.         
          
          - Saul is in a really shitty fast food restaurant, nearly     
          crying as he eats his burger and fries.                       
          
          - Dale stares at a joint in his hands, thinks for a           
          moment, and then, crying profusely, lights it and starts
          smoking.
          
          A solitary tear rolls down his cheek and drips directly
          onto the tip of the joint, putting it out. Dale hears the
          sizzle and looks at the joint. He continues crying. He        
          puts the joint down, beside three large roaches.              
          
          - Walking down the street, Saul sees the Point Grey           
          Retirement Home.                                              
          
          - Dale feverishly looks through the phone book. He finds      
          what he's looking for: Belogus.                               
          
          - Saul, hiding behind a bush across the street, surveys       
          the retirement home. Seeing the coast is clear, he walks
          towards the entrance. As Saul enters the building,            
          Budlofksy and Matheson pull up.

          Saul casually walks into the lobby. The elderly residents

          Saul turns and sees an ELDERLY WOMAN.

                    Hey! Mrs. Mendelson!
          
          Saul peers over her shoulder and sees Budlofsky and           
          Matheson walk in!

          Saul runs for it, and they chase after him. He maneuvers        
          through the elderly like a pylon course, the thugs right        
          on his ass. He bursts into another room.                        
          
          
          INT. CAFFETERIA - CONTINUOUS                                    
          
          He tears through the room, filled with old people eating.       
          Budlofsky and Matheson pursue him.                              
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                                       
          
          As Saul runs through the hall, Budlofksy and Matheson           
          appear.                                                         
          
                                   MATHESON                               
                    Eat it!                                               
          
          Matheson whip out his gun and fires - BLAM! The bullet          
          whizzes past Saul and two elderly men, who don't even           
          flinch, and then shatters a distant window. Saul turns          
          the corner and-                                                 
          
          BAM! He slams into someone, sending the person crashing         
          to the ground.                                                  
          
                                 INJURED PERSON                           
                    OW! Shit...ow, ow, ow!                                
          
          Saul looks, terrified he's hurt an old person, but sees         
          it is a young male nurse. He runs for it and sees an open       
          door with chatter coming from inside. He runs into-             
          
          
          INT. TEA ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          A dead end! Several startled OLD WOMEN look up from their
          Majong. One of them instantly recognizes Saul-
          
                                 MRS. CORBER
                    Solly Silver?!?
          
                                 SAUL
                    Mrs. Corber! You gotta hide me!
          
          The Budlofsky and Matheson bursts into the room. Saul           
          looks around, sees a teapot and grabs it. He hurls it at        
          Matheson and nails him in the face. The tea pot shatters        
          and hot water pours all over his face and hand.                 
          
                                                                    89
          
          
          
                                 MATHESON                                 
                    AHH!!! FUCK!!!                                        
          
          Budlofsky GRABS Saul and knees him in the balls.                
          
                                 SAUL                                     
                           (wheezing)                                     
                    NOOO!!!
          
                                   BUDLOFSKY                              
                    Yeah!                                                 
          

          Budlofsky punches Saul in the face.                             
          
          CUT TO BLACK

          Dale hustles towards the entrance of the building when he       
          sees several police cars parked outside, their lights           
          flashing.                                                       
          
          He sees a bunch of old people gathered on the front lawn.       
          Doing his best to avoid the cops, he joins the cluster of       
          elderly.                                                        
          
                                 OLD WOMAN                                
                    Oh, god this is terrible. Poor Faye.                  
                    Poor, poor Faye.

                    Hey, uh, what's going on here?                        
          
                                 OLD MAN                                  
                    It just happened.

                    What did?                                             
          
                                 OLD WOMAN                                
                    Faye Belogus' grandson was kidnapped from             
                    right inside the building. We all saw it.             
                    They fought in the majong room and hurt               
                    the new nurse, Stefan.                                
          
          Dale is terrified.                                              
          
                                   DALE                                   
                    Uh...thanks.

                    If I was there, I would've kicked an ass.             
          
                                                                 90
          
          
          
          Dale looks, circle of people comforting a crying old         
          woman, clearly Faye Belogus. He walks over.                  
          
                                 DALE                                  
                    Mrs. Belogus. I wouldn't worry, Saul's             
                    going to be fine.                                  
          
          Dale walks off, determined.                                  
          
          
          INT. THE BARN - SOON AFTER                                   
          
          Saul wakes up but can't see anything. From his POV we see    
          tape get ripped off his eyes and mouth.                      
          
                                   SAUL                                
                    ARRGGGHHH!!!                                       
          
          Saul sees a BUDLOFSKY wielding a knife. He struggles and     
          realizes that his arms and legs are bound. Saul closes       
          his eyes, assuming he's about to die.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)                         
                           (whispers to himself)
                    Fuck. I regret everything.                         
          
          BUDLOFSKY cuts the tape away from Saul's legs.               
          
                                   BUDLOFSKY                           
                    Get up.
          
          Saul gets up and hops out of the car. He looks around and    
          see that he is in a LARGE BARN. Saul notices SIX THUGS       
          talking as they move bricks of weed and cocaine into a       
          van.                                                         
          
          Matheson appears and looks at Saul with smoldering           
          hatred. Saul sees that his face and neck were burnt from     
          the tea and the broken shards of pot cut his cheek.          
          
                                 SAUL                                  
                    Oh fuck. That looks painful.                       
          
          Matheson walks over, lowers to one knee, and punches him     
          straight in the balls.                                       
          
                                   SAUL (CONT'D)                       
                    EEEHH!!!                                           
          
          Matheson whips out his gun and shoves it in Saul's mouth.    
          Budlofsky taps Matheson on the shoulder.                     
          
                                                                    91
          
          
          
                                 BUDLOFSKY                                
                    Don't. Ted wants him.                                 
          
                                 MATHESON                                 
                    Fine.                                                 
          
          Matheson looks at the wheezing Saul, curled over by his         
          feet, and punches him in the back of the head.                  
          
          Matheson pokes Saul in the back with his gun, ushering          
          him towards the corner of the barn. They come to an old         
          TRAP DOOR. Matheson opens the hatch and they descend.           
          
          
          INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Saul is led along a narrow tunnel. As they reach the end,       
          Saul's eyes go wide. He enters the same massive metal           
          room that the government used in the 30s (at the                
          beginning of the movie)...only now it is rather worn
          down, and filled with HUNDREDS OF HUGE MARIJUANA PLANTS.
          
                                 SAUL                                     
                           (breath-taken)
                    El Dorado.
          
          Matheson urges Saul through the dense forest of weed,           
          passing several of Ted's thugs, the hum of the giant grow       
          lights filling the air.                                         
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)                            
                    Dude, look at all this weed.                          
          
                                 MATHESON                                 
                    Shut the fuck up and keep moving.                     
          
          As Matheson ushers Saul through the foliage, Saul notices       
          a strange suit that resembles an old fashioned scuba            
          diving uniform (the one from the 1930s intro) hanging on        
          a wall.

                    What the hell is that?                                
          
          They arrive at a door. Matheson opens it and shoves Saul        
          in, causing him to almost trip.                                 
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)

          It is the same room Private Miller was in. Matheson shuts       
          the door.

                                 DALE                                     
                    Hello? Anyone here? Red?                              
          
          Dale starts looking around. He hears music and then sees        
          he's stepping in a pool of blood.                               
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)                            
                    Oh my god.                                            
          
          Dale follows the music into the bathroom.                       
          
          
          INT. RED'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS                                
          
          Dale enters and is shocked to see Red lying on the floor,       
          clenching his bloody gut with one hand and a joint and          
          beer in the other. The music is coming from a small boom        
          box.

          Red turns toward Dale and picks up a kitchen knife with         
          his bloody hand.

          Red drops the knife and then takes a puff of his joint          
          and a sip of his beer.

          Red takes a hit and coughs. It clearly brings terrible          
          pain to his bullet wound.

          Red heroic-ish-ly rises from the floor. He hobbles over         
          to the hall and opens a cabinet on the wall. Dale looks         
          in and sees several hand guns inside.

          Dale and Red are in Red's car, a FORD FIESTA, driving           
          through the countryside. Dale stops the car 100 yards           
          from the barn.

          Red gets out and walks to the drivers side. Dale gets         
          out, gun in hand. Red gets in the drivers seat.

                    an automatic weapon, zig zag. It makes

          Red drives off. Dale takes a deep breath, clenches his        
          gun, and starts cautiously moving towards the barn. He        
          checks to make sure his safety is off and he's ready to       
          fight. Dale sneaks up on the building and pears in            
          between two boards. He sees Budlofsky supervising as the      
          thugs load the van.

          Dale does a jumping role into the burn and then quickly         
          scampers to his feet and puts a gun to THUG 1's head.

          Two of the thugs grab Dale and punch him several times.         
          
                                 BUDLOFSKY (CONT'D)                       
                    Throw him in with the other guy, and                  
                    everyone stay alert. Jared, go watch                  
                    outside. This is fucked up. Somethings                
                    going down.                                           
          
          The thugs start bringing Dale towards the hatch. Suddenly       
          one of them motions for the other to stop, feeling              
          something on Dale's back.                                       
          
                                 THUG 3                                   
                    I think he's got a gun.                               
          
                                   BUDLOFSKY                              
                    What?                                                 
          
          Thug 3 lifts up Dale's shirt, revealing that he has taped       
          a gun to his back.                                              
          
                                                                 96

                    I had to try.                                      
          
          The thugs bring him down the trap door.

          Saul is sitting against the wall with his hands bound and    
          a look of complete defeat. Suddenly, the door opens and      
          Dale is tossed in by Budlofsky.                              
          
                                 SAUL
                    Dale!?! What the fuck? Did you rat me
                    out, you shitty bastard? That what
                    happened?
          
                                 DALE
                    No! I came here to save you!                       
          
                                 SAUL
                    To save me? Ha! That's rich! You're                
                    caught, too. And now I have to die with            
                    some asshole.                                      
          
                                 DALE
                    Saul, I deserved that, because I fucked            
                    you. You're right, this whole things my            
                    fault, and they only way I can make it up          
                    to you is by rescuing you, and that's why          
                    I'm here. To save my friend.                       
          
                                 SAUL
                    Tell ya what, Dale. You actually save me           
                    and I'll consider forgiving you for this           
                    mad shit.                                          
          
                                 DALE                                  
                    Good. `Cause I will.                               
          
                                                                    97
          
          
          
                                 SAUL
                    Oh really? What, you forget to tell me
                    you shoot lasers out of your eyes, or you
                    got some kind of secret blowtorch
                    strapped to your dick? We're not gonna
                    escape, Dale, we're losers, and sinners,
                    and after we die, we're gonna go to hell!
          
                                 DALE
                    We're not losers! We did that car chase.
                    That was all you, man! You got away from
                    the cops. I've watched, like, nine
                    billion hours of worlds wildest police
                    chases and I've never seen a guy get
                    away. Not once! But you did it. You did
                    the impossible.
          
          Suddenly, they both hear someone coming. The door opens.
          Matheson pokes his head, and gun, in.                           
          
                                 MATHESON                                 
                    We can hear you out there, and it's
                    annoying. Shut the fuck up.
          
          He looks Dale and Saul up and down, then shuts the door.
          Dale sits down and thinks, but is disturbed by his belt
          buckle, which is digging into his gut.
          
                                 DALE                                     
                           (whispering)
                    Perfect! Now rub your wrists against my
                    belt! My belt buckle'll cut the tape. Do
                    it! This is it!
          
          Saul is hesitant, but awkwardly gets in position anyway.
          
                                   DALE (CONT'D)
                             (whispering)
                    Hurry!
          
          In an unavoidably sexual-looking motion, Saul begins to
          gyrate against Dale's belt buckle.
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)
                           (hushed)
                    Yes! Yes! You know what this is called,               
                    Saul? This is called saving you.

          men. The acknowledge they understand. He holds up a             
          flashlight and flashes three times. From the opposing

          Dale and Saul are still "humping" away.
          
                                 DALE
                    This isn't working. Turn around. I'm
                    using my mouth.
          
          Dale drops to his knees and starts gnawing at the tape on
          Saul's hands. Suddenly, they hear approaching footsteps.
          
                                 SAUL

                           (whispering)
                    Yo - if I cough, I'm going to make a
                    move, if I cough twice, you take the                  
                    lead. Got it?

                    What? No! What if you actually cough?
          
          Dale stands up just as Matheson walks in, gun drawn. Dale       
          looks at Saul and notices that he's managed to free his
          hands.
          
          Dale COUGHS TWICE. Saul shoots him a worried look and
          shakes his head. Matheson notices. Saul COUGHS TWICE.           
          Dale shoots him a confused look. Saul motions at him and
          COUGHS TWICE MORE.
          
                                 MATHESON                                 
                    Hey man, whatever you're doing, I get it,
                    okay? So just stop it, alright? Just cut
                    it-
          
          DALE CHARGES DIRECTLY AT MATHESON!!!                            
          
          BLAM! Matheson shoots at Dale's head! Dale falls to the         
          ground, specks of blood hitting Saul as he dives
          forwards, TACKLING Matheson into the wall!                      
          
          The Matheson's gun slides across the room, hitting Dale's       
          motionless body. Saul scrambles for the gun and grabs it.
          Matheson gets to his feet. Saul turns and-                      
          
          BLAM! He shoots Matheson in the gut.                            
          
                                                                   100

          Dale's motionless body. Horrified, he flips Dale over...
          
          He's alive! The top of his left ear has been blown off!

          Behind Saul, Matheson tries to stand up, but immediately     
          falls back down.

                    and I`ve killed two bad guys already.                 
          
          Saul looks to the vent in the middle of the room. Dale          
          looks at the pipe, sizes up Saul and himself, and takes a       
          deep breath.

                    You'll never be able to pull me up, but               
                    I'll boost you up there and you just                  
                    fucking run for it, man.

                    What? No fucking way, Dale. What about                
                    you?                                                  
          
          Dale cocks his gun.                                             
          
                                 DALE

          Saul tucks the gun in his belt and awkwardly climbs atop        
          Dale's shoulders and tears the vent off.

          Saul lifts himself in. SUDDENLY, Dale sees Ted enter the     
          room and immediately go for his gun.

                    Wha-
          
          Dale walks out from under Saul, raises his gun, and          
          unloads - RATA-TAT-TAT!!! Ted ducks as the plants around     
          him are torn asunder. Dale runs out of ammo.                 
          
          BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Ted shoots at Saul, who narrowly avoids    
          the gunfire as he pulls himself into the vent. Ted           
          redirects his attention to Dale, who is running through
          the bushes. Ted blasts off a few shots before Dale
          vanishes into the foliage.

          Saul wiggles his way through the vent. He turns a corner
          and-
          
                                   SAUL
                    AHHH!!!
          
          There is a skeleton wedged in the vent. A grate leading
          out is directly above the corpse. Saul squeamishly crawls
          over the skeleton.

          EXT. OPEN FIELD - CONTINUOUS
          
          Thirty feet from the barn there is an air vent sticking
          out of the ground. The top flies off and Saul emerges. He
          flops onto the ground, then immediately scampers to his
          and pulls out his gun. Saul looks to the open road to
          freedom, then back at the barn.

          Dale frantically runs through the rows of plants, when       
          SUDDENLY he sees the strange scuba suit out of the corner    
          of his eye and swings his gun at it, nearly opening fire.    
          
                                 DALE

          Dale slows down to catch his breath, staring at the          
          strange scuba suit. Then, he gets an idea.                   
          
          ANGLE ON: Ted, quietly walking through the room              
          
          Ted raises his gun as he spins around a corner.

          Ted turns another corner and sees the strange scuba suit.    
          He starts to walk past it, when he stops himself. He         
          creeps back and looks at it, suspicious. He walks closer,    
          breathing as quietly as he can, his gun clenched tightly.    
          He slowly reaches his hand out to lift the face-hatch. He    
          gently takes hold of the latch and is about to open it,      
          when-                                                        
          
          Dale jumps out from behind him and swings a FIRE             
          EXTINGUISHER at Ted's face - SLAM!!! Ted drops his gun as    
          he falls to the floor.

          EXT. BARN - CONTINUOUS
          
          Saul inches towards the barn, hearing a melee of gunfire     
          and screams as he nears it. He cautiously peers in and       
          watches as Carol shoots an assassin in the chest then        
          spins around and shoots at another assassin who              
          desperately runs with a METAL BRIEFCASE handcuffed to his    
          wrist. Carol hits him several times; he lurches over and     
          falls through the trap door. She smiles and drops her
          empty gun.                                                   
          
          Saul watches Carol as she heads towards the trap door. He
          takes a deep breath and CHARGES into the barn, unleashing    
          a barrage of bullets at her! BLAM BLAM BLAM! CLICK.
          
                                                                   107
          
          
          CLICK. CLICK. None of the bullets hit her. She turns and
          sees Saul, who drops his empty gun.
          
                                 SAUL                                     
                    Fuck tha po-lice.
          
          They both SCREAM in rage and CHARGE, fists flying as they
          collide. Carol whips Saul around by his collar and hurls        
          him to the ground. She runs up and kicks him in the gut,        
          time and time again.

          Saul leaps to his feet and PUNCHES Carol in the face. He        
          PUNCHES her again. She reaches for her mace, so Saul            
          kicks her in the groin and grabs it for himself, then           
          sprays her in the face.                                         
          
          SLAM! He punches her in the face.

          Ted and Dale are squared off. Both are bloody lipped and        
          bruised. Dale continuously shucks and jives on the spot         
          as they talk.

          Ted rips off his shirt, revealing dozens of fearsome            
          tattoos and scars. Dale quickly picks a grow light up off       
          the ground. Ted does the same. The humming of the grow          
          lights is heard as the two men walk in a circle, squared        
          off.

          They both swing and their grow lights collide, sending          
          shards of glass everywhere.

          a plank of wood. SMASH! He shatters it over her head.

          Ted and Dale grapple violently on the ground. His gut          
          jiggles as he lunges forwards, punching Dale in the
          throat! Dale falls to his knees, gasping for air. Ted
          kicks him in the head and picks up his GUN.

          Barely alive, the Asian Assassin with the briefcase drags      
          himself down the corridor and enters the grow room. He         
          opens the briefcase and we see that it is a bomb. The          
          assassin inserts a key.                                        
          
          Ted stands over Dale, aims the gun to his head, and-
          
          KA-BOOM!!! THE BRIEFCASE EXPLODES!!!. Flames sweep over        
          the room as Dale rolls for cover. Ted gets blasted back.

          incredible force. Saul and Carol get blown back as Red's       
          Ford Fiesta is sent flying up in the air. The flaming car      
          lands DIRECTLY on Carol and explodes. The entire barn is

          The air thick with weed smoke, Dale slowly rises to his
          feet. He sees Ted slumped against the wall, dead,
          partially aflame. Dale walks over to Ted's body and takes      
          the gun out of his hand.

          He pulls a small BLUE ENVELOPE out of his pocket and
          drops it on Ted.

          Dale turns to see the exit blocked by a wall of fire. The       
          air is thick with smoke and he can barely breath. Dale          
          looks around desperately. He spots the FIRE EXTINGUISHER.       
          He looks at the flames. He takes a deep breath, picks up        
          the fire extinguisher, hurls it with all his might at the       
          fire, and then quickly whips out his gun and shoots at          
          it!                                                             
          
          BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! He hits the extinguisher and it               
          explodes, blasting out the fire in the hallway towards          
          the barn. Dale runs like hell.                                  
          
          As he bolts down the hallway, the flames rush back in and       
          chase after him.

          The barn starts to buckle, when Dale suddenly leaps out         
          of the trap door, flames licking his heels. Coughing
          profusely, Dale stands in the barn, then realizes his           
          pants are on fire.

          He starts to walk out of the barn when he suddenly trips        
          over someone.

          He grabs one of the unconscious Saul's feet and starts to       
          drag him out of the barn. Just a they exit, the barn            
          COLLAPSES in on itself, crumbling into a massive heap of        
          burning wood. Dale pulls Saul onto the grass. Saul starts
          coughing.

          emerges, lightly crisped with his clothes on fire. He

                    totally agree with you, man. I work out              
                    of my house, and it's, like, one of my               
                    main concerns, garbage pile up.                      
          
                                 DALE                                    
                    Saul, what're you going to do?                       
          
                                 SAUL

                    I'm still selling weed. Fuck you guys.               
          
          They walk together in silence, delighted at their new
          prospects. After a brief moment, Saul suddenly seems
          afraid. He starts nervously looking back towards the
          barn.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Do you hear something?
          
          Dale motions at his wounded ear.
          
                                 DALE
                    All I hear is ringing.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Dude, I'm kind of freakin' out. Like...I
                    don't know...like, there might be someone
                    out there. I mean...how do we know we got
                    them all?
          
                                 RED

                    I don't hear shit.                                   
          
          Dale starts getting nervous, but tries to hide it.
          
                                 DALE
                    Well...the barn did collapse in a ball of
                    fire, and we probably each inhaled about
                    ten pounds of weed smoke, so...it's just,
                    you know-
          
          Dale suddenly looks over his shoulder, but sees nothing.
          
                                                                     114

          Saul grabs Dale.

          darkness.

          With the barn's flaming remains the only light in sight,       
          Dale and Saul run off into the endless, dark country
          side. And as enchanting music fills the air, we humbly...
