           NARRATOR (V.O)
           In between the years when the
           oceans drank Atlantis and the rise
           of the Sons of Aryas, there was an
           age undreamed of, when shining
           kingdoms lay spread across the
           world like blue mantles under the
           stars. Hither came Conan, the
           Cimmerian: a thief, a slayer, a
           king born of battle.
                         
          Muffled sounds, as if underwater, echo: CLANGING swords, the
          guttural CRIES of combat.

          Suddenly, a flash of steel, as a sword pierces the womb, its
          tip not an inch from the baby's head.
                         
          As the sword is ripped out, light streams in from outside, we
          travel with it, into the DIN of BATTLE.

          A blonde-haired, armored AESIR RAIDER withdraws the bloody
          sword from the stomach of ISLENE, a wild-maned Cimmerian
          beauty, many months pregnant, now clutching her bloody
          stomach.
                         
          Across a muddy battlefield, the air a maelstrom of falling
          snowflakes and embers from trees aflame, the powerfully built
          CORIN rallies his fellow CIMMERIANS, until he spots Islene.

          Wielding a broadsword, runes etched into its surface, Corin
          cuts a bloody path through his enemies, his eyes never
          leaving Islene.
                         
          The Aesir standing over Islene LAUGHS as she claws at the
          earth behind her, trying to pull herself away.
                         
                          AESIR

          Islene's hand reaches back once again -- and it finds a
          fallen warrior's SWORD. In one fluid motion she swings the
          sword around her body and drives it into the gap in the
          Aesir's armor -- at his groin.
                         
                          ISLENE
           I'd ask you the same.
                         
          The Aesir HOWLS in agony, raising his sword to deliver the
          killing blow -- when another sword pierces his chest. The
          Aesir falls, revealing Corin standing behind him.
                         
          Corin throws aside his horned helmet, and falls to his knees
          beside Islene, checking her wound. When he pulls his hands
          back they are coated in blood.
                         
          Their eyes meet. Torment. Loss. They both know. She pulls a
          knife from the folds of her pelts, puts it in his hand.

           I cannot.
                         
          Islene looks to her naked belly. The baby inside presses
          against its womb, a visible impression on her flesh.
                         
                          ISLENE
           There is no time, husband. I would
           see my child's face.
                         
          Islene's eyes flutter as she struggles. Corin lowers the
          knife. Islene's eyes lock with Corin's as he puts the knife
          to use. Never once does she scream.
                         
          A moment later, Corin lifts the crying, blood-covered BOY up
          through the falling snowflakes to Islene's lap.
                         
                          ISLENE (CONT'D)

           must temper him.
                         
          She shares one kiss with her child, its first taste not of
          mother's milk, but of her blood.

          A small Cimmerian village lies in a heavily forested valley,
          a redoubt from the icy mountains surrounding it.
                         
          Round wooden huts surround a stone-lined pit, where young
          CIMMERIAN BOYS, ages 12-15 stand. Pollen drifts through the
          air, giving it an ethereal haze.
                         
          At the center of the pit URAN, an elder Cimmerian warrior
          speaks.
                         
                          URAN
           A Cimmerian warrior is like any
           other man. A Cimmerian warrior
           feels hunger. He feels cold. Like
           other men he may lie and cheat.
           (stares the boys down)
           But when a Cimmerian warrior
           hungers, he hungers only for the
           blood of his enemy. When he feels
           cold, it is the cold steel of his
           sword. When he lies, he lies in
           wait for his enemy. And when he
           cheats, he cheats death itself!
                         
          Uran stops at the end of the line, where a boy stands a good
          two heads smaller than the rest. He is no more than eight,
          but his face is as stoic, driven.
                         
                          URAN (CONT'D)

           here. Withdraw.
                         
          CONAN, determined, doesn't move an inch. The LARGEST TEEN
          menacingly steps up to the smaller boy.

          The hulking teen goes to shove Conan, but Conan pulls his arm
          towards him, lashing out with his other hand, punching the
          teen in the throat.
                         
          The large boy goes down hard, hands and knees, gasping for
          air.
                         
          A smattering of LAUGHS erupt from the boys, quickly silenced
          by Uran's stare. Uran hands out RIVER STONES to each boy,
          ending with Conan. The boys know what to do: they put the
          large stones in their mouths.
                         
                          URAN
           In the black crag in the high pass
           stands a wooden training sword. The
           one who claims it, with stone still
           in his mouth, will have earned the
           right to train with the warriors.
                         
          The boys look at each other, sizing up the competition.
                         
                          URAN (CONT'D)
           Well? What are you waiting for?!
                         
          And off they run. They knock each other down, punching the
          other's stomachs, each trying to force the other to expel
          their stones. One or two succeed.
                         
          Most of the remaining boys run for the trail that winds high
          into the mountains. But a few head right for the sheer cliff
          face.
                         
          Conan follows the ones headed to the cliff.

          And when the Cimmerian boys climb, it is a sight to behold.
          They find cracks we can barely see and scale the smooth rock
          face as though it were a ladder.
                         
          The hulking teen reaches for the same handhold as Conan,
          trying to knock him off. Conan swings with one hand and finds
          another path. In moments he is ahead.

          Conan is in the lead as he crests the cliff top, the bigger
          boys right behind him.
                         
          They race through the forest, heading uphill --

          And the largest teen elbows past Conan, into the lead. The
          boy runs two paces more and suddenly flies off his feet, an
          AXE lodged squarely in his forehead.

          The boys spit out the rocks in their mouths and YELL. They
          turn and run in the opposite direction.
                         
          Only Conan doesn't move, even as another boy pulls at him.

          turns to face the Picts, his eyes burning.

          Conan steps forward from out of a thicket, his body covered
          in Pict blood. Three PICTS lie massacred, the bodies hacked

          Uran and the other Cimmerian men exchange worried glances.

           CORIN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           The strongest blade isn't made of
           the hardest steel, boy. The hardest
           ore is what a man will die for. It

          Conan grabs a fallen sword and rushes for the nearest
          Aquilonian and RUNS HIM THROUGH. A ZINGARAN spots him and
          rushes him with his spear. Conan readies himself for the
                         CHARGE --
           13.
                         
                         
          When the Zingaran loses his head, lopped off by Corin's
          blade.

          Corin, sporting a deep gash to his abdomen, pulls a reluctant
          Conan from the battle, back toward the forge.

          The flames of the forge still burn as Corin pushes Conan into
          the room. He bolts the door behind him.
                         
                          CONAN
           Do we need more weapons?
                         
          Corin drops his sword, then struggles to lift a heavy grating
          in the dirt floor. Beneath it a trough of cooling water leads
          under the hut and away from the village.
                         
                          CORIN

           No! I will fight!
                         
          Corin grabs Conan by his tunic, pulling him up to his face.
          Corin's eyes are half-crazed.
                         
                          CORIN
           This fight is over, but yours has
           just begun. You wanted to be a
           warrior of the tribe, Conan--now
           you must be its last.
                         
                          CONAN

                          CORIN
           Good. Make your death have purpose.
                         
          BOOM. Something slams at the door. It does not budge. Again,
          BOOM.
                         
          A shadow appears under the door, sliding into the forge, and
          MATERIALIZING into the form of Remo. Remo quickly slides away
          the bolt.

          In rush enter Lucius and Ukafa. Corin and Conan face their
          attackers, fighting in close quarters. Lucius rushes at
          Conan, only for Conan to duck under his attack and --
                         
          THROW HIM IN THE FIERY FORGE. Lucius SCREAMS in agony, rising
          up to reveal half of his formerly handsome face burned to a
          crisp.
                         
          Corin fights Ukafa to a standstill, until Remo emerges from
          the shadows behind him and drives a short sword into his
          back.
                         
          Corin falls to his knees.

          Lucius delivers a massive backhand, sending Conan flying
          backwards -- and demolishing one of the Forge's main support
          beams.
                         
          Half of the forge comes crashing down on top of Conan,
          pinning his bleeding form to the ground, just a few feet from
          his fallen father.
                         
          Enraged, Lucius turns his anger to Corin, raising his sword
          to deliver the killing blow.

          Lucius stays his hand as Khalar Singh steps into the forge.
          Beside him stands the PICT who escaped from Conan earlier,
          grinning from ear to ear.
                         
          Khalar Singh hands him a bag of gold.

          The Pict nods and heads off, drawing his knife. Khalar Singh
          stares down at Corin, sizing him up.
                         
          Corin lifts up into a sitting position, back to the forge.

           choose the story for yourself. I am
           Khalar Singh. My army is handpicked

          Corin catches a glimpse of Conan, buried but staring back at
          him, unable to move. Corin quickly turns away, careful not to
          give his son away.

          Khalar looks outside the door of the forge. The Cimmerians
          women are being herded by the slavers.

           A queen in hiding. Point her out

           Then our stories began in the same
           place, Cimmerian. I too lost my
           wife to marauders. How many men, in
           how many lands have suffered so?
           The only answer is power, strength

          Conan struggles, trying to move, to yell, to do anything
          other than lie there. But a huge timber lies upon his back,
          pinning him to the ground.

          Entering the wrecked forge is FARIQ, the six year old son to
          Khalar Singh. He stares at Corin's bleeding form with the
          dispassion of a sociopath.
                         
          Khalar picks up THE SWORD Corin and Conan had forged
          together, the one Corin took away. He admires it, then hands
          it to his son. He keeps a hand on it as it is too heavy for
          his son to lift alone. He instructs his son as if teaching
          him multiplication.

          Fariq DRIVES THE SWORD INTO CORIN'S EYE. Corin doesn't make a
          sound. Once Fariq has ripped out Corin's eyes, Khalar runs
          Corin through.

                          BARKEEP
           What's he done?! What hasn't he
           done? He's bedded six of my whores
           and finished off three casks of
           mead--and he hasn't paid so much as
           a silver piece for it.
                         
                          CITY GUARD #1

           I did.
                         
          Behind the bar, six men each hold down two HULKING MEN
          YELLING in agony as their horribly broken arms are snapped
          back into place.
                         
                          CITY GUARD #2
           Sounds like a real problem. Too bad
           we have other places to be right
           now.
                         
          The Barkeep shakes his head, knowing the routine. He slips a
          pair of silver pieces into the soldier's hand.
                         
                          BARKEEP
           Just get that behemoth out of here.
                         
          The two City Guards make their way to the back of the bar.
          His back to them, the DRUNKEN MAN they're after struggles to
          pin his opponent, cobras beneath each of their wrists, ready
          to strike at the loser. A pair of voluptuous WHORES watch,
          caressing the Drunken Man's sinewy back.
                         
          The Drunken Man YELLS in fury as he SLAMS the other man's
          hand down upon the cobra, which immediately bites its prey.
                         
          As the soldiers arrive, the drunken victor throws his tankard
          of ale at the Barkeep, who's now back behind the bar.
                         
                          DRUNKEN MAN
           Piss-water! You'll serve my friends
           and I your best, barman, or you'll
           taste steel!

          The Drunken Man turns as the City Guard puts a hand on his
          shoulder.

          The gangly fifteen year old boy has grown into a powerfully
          built man, broad-shouldered with sun browned skin lined with
          battle scars. Only the piercing blue eyes and square cut
          black mane remain from the boy we last saw.
                         
          Conan stands to his full height, looming over the smaller
          City Guards, who instinctively take a step back.

          The City Guards drag Conan into a broad prison yard. Many of
          the INMATES are shackled together, hacking with picks at the
          rock walls on their work detail. Those in no condition to
          break rock are left in their own filth to rot. Some are even
          dead already, the rats gnawing at the remains.

          The two City Guards drag Conan into the guardhouse, where a
          LIEUTENANT sits eating his dinner.
                         
          The Lieutenant doesn't even bother to look up from his meal.

           Public drunkenness. Another damn

           Is that so, boy? How do you plead?
                         
          Conan yawns in response. One of the City Guards slaps Conan,
          hard, across the face. Conan slowly opens his eyes.
                         
                          CONAN

          SCREAMS OF PAIN come from down the hall, past a locked door.
                         
                          LIEUTENANT
           In the cells, interrogating a

                          CONAN
           In truth, I've been guilty of much.
           Jewels stolen from the crowns of
           kings, men's heads split in battle
           for the price of a night's drink.
           But through that I've searched and
           waited and hunted my prey.
                         
          Suddenly Conan shifts upright, looking more sober than he did
          a moment ago.

          The guards holding Conan up by his arms, suddenly find those
          arms wrapped around their heads. Twist, twist. SNAP. SNAP. He
          breaks both their necks in an instant.
                         
          The Lieutenant is horrified. He goes for his sword. Conan
          bats it out of his hand, slamming his head against the back
          wall.

          A GUARD sits on a stool next to a heavy metal door. Behind
          him, the CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD beats a chained ONE-EYED
          PRISONER to a pulpy mess.

           Need to see the Captain.
                         
          The Guard exhales, frustrated. He stands up, getting his keys
          out. He stops. Opens the small EYEHOLE to see into the other
          room.
                         
          The Lieutenant stares back at him.

           Fine, fine.
                         
          He opens the door--
                         
          Only to see Conan standing there, holding the decapitated
          head of the Lieutenant.
                         
          The shocked Guard goes for his sword. Conan swings the
          Lieutenant's head, smashing it into the Guard's jaw and
          putting him down for the count.
                         
          That's when the Captain of the Guard turns around. And WE
          RECOGNIZE HIM! He's LUCIUS, the disfigured Aquilionian who
          was one of Khalar Singh's lieutenants.

          From around a corner come five more Guards, drawing their
          weapons. Lucius draws his as well.
                         
                          LUCIUS (CONT'D)
           You've made a huge mistake, ape.

           I came for you, Lucius.
                         
          Lucius nods to the guards, who advance on Conan.
                         
                          LUCIUS

           Cimmerian.
                         
          As recognition crosses Lucius' face, Conan springs into
          action. He KICKS the table at the men, sending the knives and
          other torture implements flying right into the first guard.
                         
          The second guard tries leaping over the falling table. Conan
          just grabs him in midair and throws him even faster into the
          iron bands of the prisoner cells.
                         
          Lucius lunges at Conan, Conan steps in on him, grabbing his
          sword hand. In a show of strength, he twists Lucius' own
          sword until points down at the floor, then THRUSTS IT THROUGH
          LUCIUS' FOOT AND DEEP INTO THE WOOD FLOOR BELOW.
                         
          Lucius BELLOWS in pain, pinned to the spot.
                         
          The next three Guards rush forward, forcing Conan to deal
          with three weapons attacks at once.
                         
          The first to strike swings a mace and chain that wraps around
          Conan's sword and he tries to yank it free from Conan's grip.
          Instead, Conan pulls him in a wide circle, sending him flying
          into a wall-mounted torch. The guard burns like dry kindling.
                         
          The second to strike hits Conan on his sword hand, carving a
          deep gash and causing him to drop his sword.
                         
          Conan turns to face him, eyes filled with rage. The guard's
          face goes pale. Conan head butts him with all his might and
          the guard goes down, bleeding from mouth, nose and ears.
           24.
                         
                         
          However, the last Guard is upon Conan before he can react.
          The powerful soldier uses the shaft of his poleax to lift
          Conan off his feet and back against the far wall, pinned by
          the neck.
                         
          Conan struggles to breathe, the polearm shaft driving his
          throat into the wall. The thickness of the Cimmerian's neck
          gives him time to reach into his bracer, pulling out a hidden
          knife which he buries into the Guardsman's eye.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          Lucius SCREAMS in pain as Conan pours water on the burning
          guard, and lifts the table back onto its legs. Then he pulls
          the sword out of the floor, a thick plume of blood rising out
          of Lucius' now liberated foot.
                         
          Conan takes Lucius' face and smashes it against the table.
          Lucius looks, aghast, as Conan takes his injured hand and
          places it over the torch flame, searing the wound closed. The
          Cimmerian never even bats an eye.
                         
                          LUCIUS

           Khalar Singh himself. But you have
           to swear you won't kill me.
                         
          Conan thinks about it.
                         
                          CONAN
           You have my word. You tell me where
           I will find Khalar Singh, and I
           will not kill you.
                         
          Conan lets Lucius go. Lucius hobbles to his chair.
                         
                          LUCIUS
           He is in a city called on the edge
           of the Eastern Sea. On the edge of
           Hyboria. Khor Khalba.
                         
          Conan looks him in his eyes, sizing him up. He likes what he
          sees. In a flash, Conan grabs Lucius' head again, yanking it
          back, exposing his throat.
                         
                          LUCIUS (CONT'D)
           You gave your word!
                         
          Conan rips a SMALL KEY from a large keyring. He drops it in
          Lucius' throat. The big man chokes instantly. A second later,
          Conan pours ale from a flagon down his throat as well.
                         
          Lucius swallows the key, gasping for breath as Conan releases
          him.
                         
                          LUCIUS (CONT'D)
           What are you doing?!
                         
                          CONAN
           Toasting, to our deal.
                         
          Conan swings his sword and cuts the One Eyed Prisoner from
          the wall.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Go. You are free.
                         
          One-Eye looks at his wrists and ankles, still hobbled by
          shackles.
                         
                          ONE-EYED PRISONER
           I won't get far like this.

          Conan hands him a fallen Guardsmen's sword.
                         
                          CONAN
           The key to your shackles sits in
           the Captain's gut. Happy hunting.
                         
          The One-Eyed Prisoner grins with malice. As he closes in on
          the terrified Lucius, Conan heads for the door.
                         
                          LUCIUS
           Barbarian! I had your word! You
           said you would spare my life!
                         
                          CONAN
           No. I said I wouldn't kill you.
                         
          We hear Lucius SCREAMS OF PAIN as Conan walks out into the
          night, cutting another notch into his arm.

          EXT. DESERT SANDSTORM - DAY
                         
          KHALAR SINGH looks older. Worn. He squints as he stares into
          a howling sandstorm.
                         
          UKAFA trudges through the deep sand to reach him. The
          sandstorm is so blinding we don't see him until he is less
          than five feet away.
                         
                          UKAFA
           Khalar Singh, we've lost half our
           cavalry legion, and still Fariq
           presses on! We must turn back!
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           He says the Queen is here.
                         
                          UKAFA
           He leads us in circles. He knows
           nothing of leading an army --
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Take care, Ukafa. You hold a
           special place in my kingdom, but
           blood you are not.
                         
                          UKAFA
           My apologies, Khalar Singh. I am
           simply concerned for your army.
           27.
                         
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           And I would gladly sacrifice every
           last man to get my hands on the
           Queen. And in that respect, Fariq
           has my confidence. He knows more of
           the legends of Acheron than anyone.
                         
          Suddenly, two forms race at them from the blinding sand. REMO
          and FARIQ. No longer a child, Fariq is now a man in his
          twenties, but he is hardly the strong warrior his father is.
          His frame is slight, his eyes beady.
                         
                          FARIQ
           Father, they are here! The hidden
           oasis, just as it was written.
                         
          Khalar Singh looks to Remo for confirmation. The misshapen
          and shadowy Remo nods.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAVE TUNNEL - DAY
                         
          Remo and Fariq lead Khalar and Ukafa into a natural tunnel
          carved out of rock. Inside, the sandstorm no longer rages.
                         
          And on the other side of the tunnel --
                         
                         
          EXT. OASIS - CONTINUOUS
                         
          A protected rock oasis, heavy vegetation crawling up the
          encircling cliff walls, herds of sheep grazing on fields of
          grass. At its far end, beyond a deep blue pond, lies a Greek-
          influenced monastery and several tiled-roof, mud-brick
          houses.
                         
          And moving between the pools are MEN and WOMEN going about
          their simple chores. They wear long flowing white linen robes
          and turbans.
                         
          The air and sand are perfectly still within the perimeter of
          the oasis. But beyond it, the sandstorm rages all around,
          sand hurled violently hundreds of feet into the air, swirling
          around the oasis as though it were the eye of some mystical
          hurricane, protected by an unseen force.
                         
          A row of robed YOUNG WOMEN kneel in front of one of the
          reflecting pools, quietly reading from prayer books and
          softly striking their right breast with a left hands wrapped
          in thorns.
                         
          One girl, ILIRA, mischievously taps the shoulder of the girl
          next to her with her thorn. The girl, TAMARA, squeals in
          pain, angry her prayer was interrupted.
           28.
                         
                         
          Ilira is the fun-loving dilettante of the relationship.
          Tamara the studious good girl.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Stop it! I'm trying to pray!
                         
                          ILIRA
           I'm bored.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Then hit yourself.
                         
          Tamara hits Ilira back with her thorn. Ilira SQUEALS, then
          hits a grinning Tamara back. Tamara grabs her, but as they
                         TUSSLE--
                         
           FASSIR (O.S.)
           Is that how one shows penitence?
                         
          Both girls instantly stop as FASSIR appears behind them.
          Fassir is an elder monk and leader of the monastery. He
          shakes his head, both out of fondness and disappointment.
                         
                          FASSIR (CONT'D)
           I expect more from a queen.
                         
                          ILIRA
           I'm sorry, Fassir. I just tire of
           saying the same prayer every day.
                         
                          FASSIR
           Then you should be able to
           translate it from its original
           Acheronian.
                         
          Ilira's face scrunches, unsure. Tamara steps in to help Ilira
          save face.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Of course she can. She even taught
           it to me. "Never again."
                         
                          FASSIR
           Go on.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Never again will we stand by as
           darkness consumes the world. Never
           again will innocents suffer for
           others' power. Never again will the
           Queen suffer so Acheron may rise.
           29.
                         
                         
                          FASSIR
           Very good, Tamara. You must have
           taught her very well indeed, Ilira.
                         
          A smile on Fassir's face confirms he knows the truth.
                         
          Suddenly, the monastery's BELL RINGS OUT. A moment later, a
          temple EXPLODES in flames.
                         
          Pouring out from the swirling sands come Khalar Singh's army.

          MAN OF WAR
                         
          A massive siege engine atop which CHEREN and his archers fire
          FLAMING ARROWS. The arrows arc down and explode as they
          impact the tiled roofs.
                         
          Sitting at the highest point of the Man Of War, Khalar Singh
          likes what he sees.
                         
                         CHAOS
                         
          The monks scatter in every direction, but wherever they turn,
          more troops burst out of the swirling sand.
                         
          A small handful of armed MONKS display acrobatic martial arts
          prowess as they battle with Khalar's heavily armed forces,
          but they are vastly outnumbered.
                         
          Fassir grabs Tamara.

          Tamara grabs Ilira and pulls her through the flaming
          battleground. Zingaran warriors cut down the monks while
          Turanian horsemen concentrate on the women.
                         
                          ILIRA

          WHIP! A whip encircles Ilira's waist. A massive TURANIAN
          pulls her to him. Tamara grabs the whip, pulling Ilira the
          other way. But she is no match for the huge slaver. He yanks
          on the whip pulling both of them to him --

          Only then does he notice Tamara's unsheathed knife which she
          plunges into his throat.
                         
          She frees Ilira and they run.

          A thin alleyway at the rear of the monastery, leading away
          from the din of battle, towards a rear gate of the oasis.
                         
          Tamara and Ilira run for the gate, only for the shadows of
          the alleyway to move and shift -- REMO and three of his
          shadow scouts.

          Tamara lunges for the nearest shadow scout with her knife,
          but when she strikes, she hits nothing but shadow. It reforms
          behind her and grabs her.
                         
          Another grabs Ilira. Tamara launches her body into the air,
          executing a backflip that puts her behind the shadow scout. A
          quick knife strike and he goes down.
                         
          And with one continuous motion, she vaults over the shadow
          scout holding Tamara, cutting his throat as well.
                         
          Remo and the remaining scout give chase, blending in and out
          of shadows. But each time they strike, Tamara defends Ilira.
          They near the far end of the alleyway, the North gate looming
          ahead with the desert beyond.

                         TURANIAN HORSEMEN
                         
          racing down the hill, behind the boulders.
                         
          As the riders bear down upon the slavers, the Slavers do as
          they're told, entangling the legs of the first wave of
          horses, throwing their riders.
                         
          More than a few riders SNAP their necks as they're driven
          into the desert floor. The remainder fight hand to hand, and
          are cut down by either Conan's blade or the slavers' tulwars.
          But their victory is short lived --
                         
          As a SECOND WAVE OF RIDERS comes thundering towards them,
          before the Slavers can re-establish their perimeter. The
          riders start cutting the slavers down where they stand.

          Conan lodges his sword in a still-rolling boulder. As it
          rolls, it pulls him up on top of it. From this height, Conan
          launches himself down at the horsemen below.
                         
          WHAM! He knocks a rider off his horse, Conan landing square
          in the saddle. He kicks the horse straight at the other
          riders. They don't see him coming until it's too late. He
          cuts them down where they sit.
                         
          The last remaining CARAVAN DRIVER whips his horse team,
          trying to pull his wagon out of the fight. Conan spins to see
          a FLASH of steel and the rider's neck plumes in blood as he's
          decapitated.
           38.

          wagon.

          The explanation comes as the shadow behind the driver MORPHS
          into Remo, the spindly Shadow Scout. He takes the reins,
          stopping the wagon.
                         
          Conan spots him, recognition in his eyes.

           You!
                         
          There's a SCREAM. Conan turns to see the other two SHADOW
          SCOUTS already hacking their way through the slaves on one of
          the caged wagons. A Shadow Scout gets to Tamara, only to have
          her FIGHT BACK.
                         
          Tamara kicks the first Scout in the face, slamming his head
          into the bars. However, the second one clubs her unconscious
          from behind.

          Leaps from his horse, launching his body at Remo. Remo dives
          and rolls away. Small and misshapen, he is nonetheless very
          fast.
                         
          Conan strikes again. Again Remo dodges out of the way.
                         
          The Shadow Scouts draw swords, but Remo waves them off,
          speaking in the broken language of a savage.

           The girl! Bring her to Khalar!
                         
          Conan launches an all out attack. Remo leaps over his sword
          and vaults Conan, landing on his back. He draws his sword,
          preparing to cut Conan's throat --
                         
          When Conan hurls his body backwards, into one of the huge
          rolling boulders. The impact crushes Remo and he loses his
          grip.
                         
          Conan spins to strike again, only to see Remo MELT INTO THE
          SHADOW OF THE BOULDER.
                         
          Conan turns his attention towards the other two Shadow Scouts
          as they drag the unconscious Tamara away.

          Conan mounts one of the cavalry horses and gallops towards
          the Scouts. They see him coming and let go of Tamara. THEY
          MELT AWAY INTO HER SHADOW AND DISAPPEAR.

          Dazed, she struggles to her feet. Conan appears beside her,
          his dagger out. Tamara gasps in fear but Conan only reaches
          out and breaks the lock on her chains.

          scene revealed to her.
                         
          Dead bodies of the Slavers and Turanian horsemen lie sprawled
          in every direction. Tamara takes in the gruesome sight,
          shocked.

          tethered to Conan's saddle by a long rope. Tamara looks
          exhausted.
                         
          They reach a gallery of broken columns, spires of fossilized

           You speak of animals as if they
           were less than men. But animals
           don't stab their brothers in the

          Conan get off his horse, unties Tamara and gives her a water
          sack. Tamara greedily drinks down the water.

          Conan then grabs Tamara around her waist, putting her atop
          his horse. He then mounts behind her, their bodies close.

                          TAMARA
           Should you fail, I'll be left
           without a weapon, helpless in my
           enemies hands. Let me help, Conan.
                         
          Conan responds by putting the gag back in her mouth.
                         
                          CONAN
           I will not fail.
                         
          But still Tamara glares at him -- and we can see the hint of
          Conan's resolve bending.

          EXT. GREAT WALL - DAY
                         
          Khalar Singh stands atop the wall, awaiting Conan. Fariq
          draws close.
                         
                          FARIQ
           Let me take care of this thief,
           father. He's beneath your notice.

                          KHALAR SINGH
           He killed Remo, likely his cavalry
           legion as well. Whatever he is, he
           is more than a mere thief.
                         
          Then, off in the distance, at the far edge of the desert
          clearing, two figures step out from amongst the boulders.
                         
          CONAN AND TAMARA
                         
          Conan holds a squirming, but bound Tamara.

          Khalar reaches down and lifts a heavy sack of gold coins.

          GATES OF THE WALL - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          The gates open and Khalar strides out into the clearing.
                         
          CONAN AND TAMARA

                          CONAN
           Send the gold.
                         
          Khalar Singh throws the gold sack. It lands halfway between
          them. He sends Tamara ahead, her mouth gagged.
                         
          But the moment Tamara reaches the gold --
                         
          From out underneath the sand, FOUR HORSEMEN rise up out of
          the desert floor. They each bear weighted nets and spiked
          lances, and they surround Conan.
           51.
                         
                         
          The first rider gallops towards Conan who simply LOPS OFF THE
          HORSES FRONT LEGS. As the beast collapses, Conan crushes the
          rider's skull with his broadsword.
                         
          The next two riders attack together, but Conan dodges their
          nets and rips away one of their spears, only to lodge it into
          the other rider's chest. He dives at and tackles the first
          rider, TOPPLING HIM, ALONG WITH HIS HORSE. He snaps the
          second rider's neck.
                         
          The last rider comes at Conan, who horizontally slashes RIGHT
          THROUGH THE HORSE'S NECK AND THEN THE RIDER'S NECK. Both
          human and animal head tumble to the desert floor.
                         
          All four riders are dead, in a matter of seconds.
                         
                         KHALAR
                         
          Smiles. He's got Tamara by the neck.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           You're fast. But are you fast
           enough?
                         
          Conan's eyes go to the top of the wall, where CHEREN and his
          archer prepare to fire. Conan rushes forward as the flaming
          arrows stream toward him.
                         
          EXPLOSIONS rip through the air where Conan was, throwing up a
          huge dust cloud.
                         
          Conan bursts out of the dust cloud, lunging in an attack.
                         
          But Khalar Singh is not there. He has withdrawn inside the
          gates.
                         
          Baring his teeth, Conan runs at the wall itself.
                         
          Cheren and the archers let loose another volley at Conan, who
          evades and strikes away the falling arrows with his sword.
                         
          Explosions fill the air, but none of them scorch Conan as he
                         REACHES
                         
          THE GREAT WALL
                         
          Conan hits the base of the wall at full stride, like a
          mountain lion. Reaching out, he launches himself up, taking
          half the vertical of the wall in a single leap.
                         
          Digging his hand into the seam of the wooden beams, he stops
          only to vault up again, taking the forty foot wall in two
          upward bounds.
           52.
                         
                         
                         WALL WALK
                         
          Conan leaps upon wall walk, the passageway atop the Great
          Wall.
                         
                         FARIQ
                         
          Tries to hide his surprise. Even as he draws his sword, Conan
          takes out the four SOLDIERS in his way.
                         
                          FARIQ
           You should have run, while you
           could.
                         
          Conan looks at the sword. It strikes a chord in him. IT IS
          THE SWORD HIS FATHER FORGED! Enraged, Conan charges the
          slight Fariq.
                         
          Fariq partially parries the attack. He's obviously well-
          trained, but he's no match for Conan. The tip of Conan' blade
          cuts a large gash in Fariq's cheek.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           Fariq!
                         
          Khalar Singh arrives, grabbing his son by his collar and
          flinging him away from the barbarian. Fariq struggles to
          stand, trying in vain to hide his embarrassment.
                         
          Conan and Khalar Singh size each other up on the narrow wall
          walk.
                         
                          CONAN
           I was wondering what it would take
           for you to stop cowering.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
           I wasn't cowering. I was studying.
           You're quite gifted with a sword,
           but it's not from schooling. Your
           speed and power makes up for a lack
           of -- finesse. I've seen such
           fighting before -- Cimmerian.
                         
          Enraged, Conan charges Khalar Singh. He swings down on Khalar
          Singh's head, only when the sword reaches it, it finds
          nothing but air. Khalar is fast.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           Cimmerian it is. Now it makes
           sense. You came for blood, not
           gold.
           53.
                         
                         
          Conan responds by lunging in, swinging his broadsword in a
          broad arc, with all his might. Even in the small space,
          Khalar's lateral speed is dizzying. He sidesteps Conan's
          attack and backhands Conan's face with the flat of his
          tulwar.
                         
          Conan's resolve wavers momentarily, knowing Khalar could have
          just as easily sliced his throat.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           Your people barely afforded me a
           challenge. You're little more than
           beasts.
                         
          Conan comes at Khalar with twice as much fury, smashing
          entire posts as he hacks at the warlord, who simply evades
          the attack.
                         
          Down the wall walk they move, Conan attacking while Khalar
          seems complacent enough just to defend.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           You've come a long way, barbarian,
           only to fail.
                         
          Khalar ducks Conan's last wild swing and gashes Conan twice,
          both deeply in his midsection. Khalar then KICKS Conan,
          sending the Cimmerian slamming onto the rock parapet.
                         
          CRUNCH. Conan lands directly on his back, his sword
          clattering away from him. Khalar's men back away into a
          circle. Conan struggles to get on all fours.
                         
          Khalar KICKS Conan in his shattered chest, lifting Conan off
          the ground with his might. He follows up with a devastating
          punch to Conan's face, one which lands like a piledriver.
          CRUNCH.
                         
          Conan can only bleed as Khalar looms over him.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           So much for vengeance.
           (to his soldiers)
           Get me oil -- and a torch.
                         
          Soldiers quickly bring over a bucket of oil and a lit torch.
                         
           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
           Is that really the best you could
           do? Is that as far as you could
           think ahead? Just rush in and kill
           me?
           54.
                         
                         
          Behind Khalar Singh, Conan spots Tamara being brought up, her
          hands bound. Her eyes show an intense fear, but resolve as
          well.
                         
                         TAMARA' HANDS
                         
          Between the bonds she slips down a blade. It's CONAN'S
          DAGGER. She quickly cuts her bonds.
                         
          With all the attention focused on Conan, no one is quick
          enough to stop her as GRABS THE TORCH FROM THE SOLDIER,
          LIGHTING THE ARROWS IN CHEREN'S QUIVER.
                         
          Cheren spins around, sees the flames reaching his pitched
          arrows.

          But it's far too late. Tamara hits the floor, beside Conan.
          BOOM.
                         
                         EXPLOSION
                         
          The blast sends parts of Cheren flying in every direction.
          Ukafa, Fariq, and the wall guards are flattened by the
          concussion.
                         
          Khalar Singh, who was standing closer to the explosion, is
          THROWN AGAINST THE WALL!

          The warlord slowly rises, his head pounding from the
          explosion. He looks up. The entire parapet is on fire.
                         
          He grits his teeth and climbs the wall.
                         
          ATOP THE WALL
                         
          A thick wall of flame rages before Khalar. Conan and Tamara
          are gone. He looks over the far side of the wall, where two
          figures on horseback ride off into the distance, Tamara
          holding Conan atop the horse.
                         
          Ukafa and Fariq rise and see what Khalar Singh sees.

          A smile creeps up on Ukafa's face, watching Fariq's
          embarrassment. He withdraws hastily, all eyes on him.

           It is no fable. It's my people's
           history. Acheron was an empire that
           swallowed all of Hyboria, led by
           the King and his legion of demon
           warriors. Unstoppable. Insatiable.
           Immortal. But still it had one
           weakness. For the true power of
           Acheron laid not with its King, but
           the Queen. Every twenty years, a
           new queen from the royal line would
           be coronated with a crown of iron.
           Spikes would pierce her, slowly
           drain her precious blood, and
           through her suffering Acheron would
           remain invincible. Until one of my
           ancestors, an Acheronian himself,
           put a stop to this tyranny. He and
           others spirited the new Queen away,
           hiding her from the empire and all
           those who would raise it again.

          AKHUN and his Turanian slavers lead the female monks into a
          large circular chamber, lit by many torches. Before them lies
          a PIT, dark and foreboding, with a bamboo grid placed atop

          down into the pit.
                         
          AN INHUMAN GROWL emits from the darkness. Something comes.

          Suddenly, a MASSIVE TENTACLE, ten times the size of the one
          in the box, comes hurtling up through the grid. It grabs the
          young monk, its barbs ripping into her, dragging her into the
          darkness below.

           They are doing -- something.
                         
          Sure enough, the stern of the ship begins to part, revealing -
                         
          A MASSIVE CROSSBOW

          They fire the weapon. The harpoon races for the bow of the
          Warship, a thick rope trailing it. It smashes into the wood,
          ripping through it like it was paper.

          and the harpoon back towards the Wasp.
                         
          As it's pulled out, the barbs of the harpoon rip a wider hole

          WARSHIP - INSIDE
                         
          The harpoon lodges deep inside the hull -- where Ukafa and

          They do not notice Ukafa and his dozen spearmen clasping the
          very same rope as its pulled toward the Galley.

          The Spearmen rush to the attack. The pirates spring to the
          defense of the ship, countering the Spearmen with cutlass and
          dagger. Ukafa marshals his men as a fierce battle rages.

          The sea captain proves dangerous in his own right, grabbing
          the head of one of the Spearmen and violently pulling it down
          to the gunwale of the ship, impaling the Spearman's eye on a
          handspike.

          The Cimmerian cuts through a Spearman, his gaze focused on
          Ukafa. Ukafa stares right back as he runs through a pair of
          pirates. Finally, the two warriors stand only feet apart.
                         
          The two warriors eye each other with satisfaction. Ukafa's
          frightening, sharpened gold teeth shine as he smiles.
                         
                          UKAFA (CONT'D)

           Cimmerian. Yours dies this day.
                         
          Conan responds by lunging forward, swinging his sword in a
          broad arc. Ukafa is just as quick, stepping back and allowing
          his spear to block the swing.
                         
          Ukafa whirls the war spear in great circles, forcing Conan to
          parry, stepping back beyond the spear's reach.
                         
          The two powerful warriors trade blows back and forth, neither
          able to gain the advantage.

          Ukafa tries to spear Conan through the chest, and Conan
          decides to drop his sword, grabbing the spear as it passes by
          him.
                         
          Conan then pulls on the spear, throwing Ukafa off his
          balance, towards Conan. Conan then kicks the warrior in the
          chest, hurtling Ukafa backwards.
                         
          Now Conan turns the spear on its master. Ukafa, unarmed, is
          forced to backpedal as Conan thrusts the spear at him. A pair
          of close misses leaves Ukafa with gashes on his chest and
          arm, but he manages to knock the spear from Conan's hands.
                         
          The battle goes to hand-to-hand. It's primal, each of them
          covered in blood. Ukafa bear hugs Conan, then resorts to
          using his teeth to bite into Conan's shoulder.
                         
          Conan YELLS IN PAIN, butting Ukafa's head and knocking him
          back. Conan falls to the stern of the ship, his back against
          the harpoon crossbow.
                         
          Ukafa shakes off the head butt, and sees his spear nearby. He
          picks it up.
                         
                          UKAFA (CONT'D)
           Now finally, you die.
                         
          He raises up to hurl the spear through Conan, only to see
          Conan manning the harpoon, NOW TURNED TO FACE UKAFA.
                         
          The crossbow fires and the harpoon punches a massive hole
          through Ukafa, its momentum throwing him off the galley, into
          the sea beyond.

          reaches in and grabs her.
                         
          As she's pulled out, Tamara SCREAMS right in Conan's face. He
          doesn't even flinch.

          Just then, a FALCON approaches. The Falconer retrieves it, a
          parchment tied to its talon. He passes it on to Khalar Singh.

          The boar goes down, the blade through its jugular. Conan
          walks up to the struggling beast, showing no satisfaction as
          he mercifully SNAPS its neck.

          stops chewing.
                         
          Tamara notices. Embarrassed, she turns so that he can only
          see her side. Conan returns to his food.

           being a mother was somehow not my
           fate. But--
                         
          Tamara falters, unsure. But Conan's quiet eases her.

           I don't lie.
                         
          Tamara nods, having heard as much about Conan. She turns back
          to face him, no longer hiding her body.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Then we don't have much time. Your
           mother perished too young, but at
           least she died having known the
           touch of one who cared.

          build.

          But Conan shows surprising gentleness as he removes her robe
          and pulls her naked body into his, their mouths meeting in a
          desperate kiss.

          Conan lies atop Tamara by the fire, their sinewy limbs
          intertwined, fingers locked together. He thrusts into her,
          causing her face to contort in pleasure and pain.
                         
          The fire grows brighter as Tamara rolls on top, undulating as
          their pace quickens. Tamara CRIES OUT in ecstasy.

          Conan growls and pulls himself atop Tamara. Looking down at
          her face, her hair loose and wild, she's beautiful in the
          soft glow of the firelight.

          They're a flinty collection, many of them missing fingers or

          One-Eyed Thief uses the tabletop to explain the fortress.

           ONE EYED THIEF
           I didn't say that. I just said
           there's no known way in -- because
           no one has ever tried to. But
           breaking out -- that's another

           it's possible.

          Tamara is the last to follow Conan, the One Eyed Thief and
          the three THIEVES from before down a short ladder. Below lies
          a darkened catacomb, lit only by their torches.

           dungeon.
                         
          Tamara's foot drops into knee high water. She immediately
          grabs her nose.

          Tamara eyes the muddy water, nothing visible beneath its

          The group wades through the water, single file. Conan notices
          HIEROGLYPHICS and carvings on the wall of the catacomb.
          Massive creatures of the sea, dark sorcery, ritual sacrifice.

           A warning. These catacombs are
           connected to the sea. It says that
           the beasts of Acheron protect its
           secrets.

           Not from me.
                         
          Conan presses on, into the darkness.
                         
                         
          INT. CISTERN - NIGHT
                         
          The catacomb widens out to a giant circular cistern, its
          walls rising up high into the darkness. As the torches bring
          light to the space, we see HUNDREDS OF DEAD, ROTTING BODIES.
                         
          As Conan and Tamara walk forward, the One Eyed Thief and the
          other stop at the entrance.
                         
           ONE EYED THIEF
           Sorry, friend. We stop here. We've

           within to go any further.
                         
          Conan simply nods and the thieves depart. Conan raises his
          torch, illuminating the near wall.
                         
                          TAMARA

           Around. Up.
                         
          Conan heads off one direction, leaving Tamara to navigate the
          other half. Her torch illuminates the grizzly path ahead. She
          inhales deeply and takes her first step.
                         
                         CONAN

          Following the slick wall, he passes many DEAD BODIES, but
          only one catches his eye. He stops before it.

          Nothing more than a skeleton, picked clean by the rats. But
          he still bears his leather armor, and a horned helmet that
          resembles his father's own.
                         
          Conan takes the helmet and places it on his head. It fits
          perfectly.
                         
                         TAMARA
                         
          Tamara is gingerly making her way through the knee high
          sewage water and the dead bodies submerged within.
                         
                          TAMARA
           Oh!!!
                         
          Tamara leaps up, swinging the torch down towards the water.
          Conan, nearby, unsheathes his sword.
                         
                          CONAN
           What?
                         
                          TAMARA
           Something touched me. Something
           slimy.
                         
          Conan walks over, the torchlight revealing something on
          Tamara's leg. It's a SLUG, which he flicks off.
                         
                          CONAN
           Crom! Stop wasting time.
                         
          But when Conan steps forward, something ROILS THE WATER right
          before him. He spots a HUGE TENTACLE just before its
          submerges back into the water.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Crom indeed.
                         
          Then Tamara SCREAMS as another tentacle rises up from the
          water, wrapping around her waist. Tamara grabs hold of the
          wall as the tentacle tries to pull her underwater.
                         
          Conan immediately SLASHES the tentacle, pulling Tamara away.
          The squirming decapitated tentacle squirts black blood
          everywhere, the knee high water seems to come alive with
          roiling intensity.
                         
          Conan spins, finding a circular stone staircase tiled into
          the far cistern wall.

          Carved out of solid black rock, both sides of the broad
          corridor are occasionally punctuated by thick steel doors,
          leading to prison cells.
                         
          Conan and Tamara emerge from a sewer drain, pushing their way
          to the floor of the hallway. The heavy darkness presses in on
          Conan's torch like a sentient, animate thing.
                         
          The floor of the corridor is lined with DEAD BODIES, in
          varying states of decay. There are buckets, filled with
          entrails and feces, upended. Tamara put her hand over her
          mouth.
                         
          Conan continues down the hallway. He and Tamara begin to hear
          the sound of EERIE CHANTING.

          Up ahead, the torch-lined dungeon plunges into darkness as
          the torches end. Conan holds up his own torch, struggling to
          peer into the black void.
                         
                          CONAN
           Nothing good.
                         
          Conan takes a step forward when suddenly a POWERFUL WIND
          blows out his torch. A moment later, there's the sound of A
          GATE WHISTLING DOWN AND CRASHING INTO THE GROUND.
                         
          In the darkness, comes a DEEP, EARTHY CHUCKLE.

          A HOST OF OIL LIGHTS SUDDENLY COME UP, revealing that the
          gate that closed behind them was actually just a door to a

          void.
                         
          Hanging high above the pit, in baskets, lie other PRISONERS,
          including Tamara's fellow female monks. Several of them YELL
          out Tamara's name as they see her.
                         
          And watching everything, from an amphitheater above the cage,

          The first two COMBATANTS attack as one, the first wielding a
          short sword, the other a pike. The pikeman thrusts first,
          Conan deftly stepping aside, then pulling the pike, sending
          the wielder off balance and into the abyss.
                         
          The prisoner with the short sword doesn't fare much better,

          Tamara sees that the prisoner baskets are suspended by the
          top half of the metallic cage. She begins scaling the cage,
          her eyes set upon the imprisoned monks.

          Conan readies himself as the first one steps up, only to have
          the combatant suddenly grabbed by a ENORMOUS TENTACLE, much
          like the one Conan cut through earlier.

          Up from the darkness of the pit comes a gargantuan monster; a
          gigantic octopus-like behemoth, with multiple tentacles that
          feed a pulsing black orifice lined with razor sharp teeth.
                         
          The creature reaches out and grabs another SCREAMING
          combatants, lowering him to its mouth and devouring him in
          its gnashing maw.
                         
          The creature reaches for Conan, who ducks underneath the
          tentacle, the slices it off. He immediately turns back to
          check on Tamara -- and he discovers she's not there.
                         
          He looks up to see Tamara scaling the cage, now nearly fifty

          tentacle, and reaches out to GRAB TAMARA BY THE ARM AS SHE
          FALLS. His shoulder nearly pops out, but he manages to hold
          onto Tamara.

          She swings above the chasm, the gnashing teeth of the monster
          below her. Only a single splintering plank holds her and
          Conan aloft.

          the edge of the pit.
                         
          But as he gets to his feet, he spots the massive Akhun
          entering the arena.
                         
                         AKHUN
                         
          The giant warrior grins as he boards the same plank as Conan.
          He thrusts his thunderous legs down, causing the plank to
          bend and warp.
                         
          Conan struggle to balance on the undulating plank, but his
          training in Cimmeria serves him well.
                         
          Akhun smiles and step closer, again thrusting down with his
          legs. Conan's balance is thrown, but there's no other plank
          close enough for him to jump to.

          Akhun steps down on the plank one last time, but this time
          Conan uses the momentum to SPRINGBOARD UP INTO AIR.
                         
          Conan soars into the air, his cat-like reflexes keeping him
          focused as he lands right before the stunned Akhun. With one
          great slash of his blade, Conan eviscerates Akhun.

          Tamara shares hugs of joy with the other monks of her flock.

          The two Guards come forward, sword drawn, only to meet with a
          CRUNCHING blow by Conan's weapon. Both their heads get caved
          in.
                         
          Fariq rushes Conan, getting in too close for Conan's wide
          swings. Conan simply meets Fariq's sword with the heavy
          chains, then encircles Fariq's neck with the steel bonds.
                         
          Fariq CHOKES, falling to the ground, gasping for air. But
          Conan doesn't kill him -- yet.
                         
                         THE FORGE
                         
          A vat of molten steel bubbles in a cauldron within the forge.
          Conan uses tongs to lift the cauldron out.

          Conan kicks him onto his back. Fariq's last vision is that of
          Conan, tipping the cauldron, the hot iron descending toward
          his eyes. Fariq SCREAMS.
                         
          Conan reaches down and picks up Fariq's sword. THE SWORD
          CONAN'S FATHER MADE FOR HIM.
                         
                         
          EXT. SEA PENINSULA - NIGHT
                         
          By torchlight, Khalar Singh leads his black-armored PERSONAL
          GUARD, two dozen men strong, across a rocky peninsula,
          jutting out into the sea. On the back of Khalar's horse,
          bound, rides the helpless Tamara.
                         
          As they round a large rock spire they spy a fearsome and awe
          inspiring sight. A massive SKULL, seemingly a natural rock
          formation, rises over the peninsula.
                         
          As they ride closer, we can make out one more detail -- the
          mouth of the skull is actually a massive door, at least sixty
          feet high, and seemingly made up of jagged bone. It has the
          appearance of teeth, completing the skull illusion.
           93.

          It takes the full complement of soldiers to open the enormous
          doors. Khalar Singh rides in. Moonlight from the huge eyes of
          the skull illuminate terrifying faces in the darkness. Faces
          of demonic warrior statues.
                         
          At their feet lie the decaying bones of human skeletons, too
          numerous to count.

          Khalar nods to his men. Two Guardsmen take their torches and
          light other torches set in the walls. It sets off a chain
          reaction. As far as the eye can see torches ignite revealing
          the true scope of this place.
                         
          An enormous cave, the walls lined with monumental columns
          that frame countless bas relief carvings of demonic origin.
                         
          And at the far of the cave, an ALTAR sits beneath a raised
          THRONE, surrounded by a SACRIFICIAL POOL. The pool is empty.

          Khalar dismounts at the sacrificial altar, carved of out of
          purple-shaded rock. Around its edges are deep channels, for
          the blood of its victims. And on its four corners -- shackles
          of bone.

           For one to ascend to royalty,
           another must fall.
                         
          With the flick of a wrist, Khalar cuts Tamara's bonds.
           94.
                         
                         
          Tamara head butts him, struggling to escape, but Khalar
          absorbs the blow effortlessly. He throws Tamara upon the
          altar, his two guards shackling her in place.

           For a hundred generations the kings

          Khalar snaps his fingers and two guardsmen bring an ornately
          carved BOX MADE OF BONE, laying it before the altar. Like a
          Chinese puzzle box, Khalar manipulates the carvings of
          skulls, sacrifices, and creatures until the box UNLATCHES.
                         
          And from the box he lifts two items. A CROWN OF GOLD and A
          CROWN OF IRON. The crown of gold is magnificent, ornately
          detailed gold that glows in the firelight.
                         
          But the crown of iron is terrifying. Huge rough spikes extend
          from it in every direction. It looks more like a weapon than
          a crown.

          nothing more than his sword, his loincloth and a small BURLAP
          SACK tied to his hip.
                         
          He stumbles, falling to his knees. His wounds have taken a
          grave toll. Still he stands and presses on.
                         
          He pushes on the doors. They do not budge in the least. He
          puts his shoulder to the doors -- his every muscle straining
          to their utmost. Again -- no movement.
                         
          Conan backs away, taking stock of the surroundings. He climbs
          up the side of the rock.

          Khalar Singh continues his chant and places the gold crown
          upon his head. As he does so, the light from the moon
          reflects off the crown, bathing the sacrificial pool in an
          unnatural glow.
                         
          THUMP-THUMP. A deep and foreboding sound echoes throughout
          the cave, shaking everything like an earthquake. It sounds
          like the heartbeat of a giant.
                         
          Khalar next places the iron crown around Tamara's head. She
          thrashes and struggles but to no avail.
                         
          Once the crown is around her head -- THUMP-THUMP! The spikes
          around the iron crown grow shorter AS THE SPIKES DRIVE

          Blood drips from beneath the crown, flowing into channels

          THUMP-THUMP. The statuary shakes, indeed the whole earth

          She pushes with all her might, lifting the crown of iron off
          her bloodied head --
                         
          When the Guardsmen charge her, pin her down, and force the
          crown back on.
                         
          THUMP, THUMP! The crown spikes imbed themselves even deeper
          as Tamara SCREAMS. The blood now fills the channels of the
          altar.
                         
          WE FOLLOW the trail of blood, down the side of the altar, in
          a spiral channel around the leg, and in a wide circle around
          the altar until reaching the channel's end --
                         
          THE FIRST DROP OF TAMARA'S BLOOD TOUCHES THE SACRIFICIAL
          POOL. It BOILS instantly, multiplying itself exponentially,
          bubbling forth and filling the entire pool.
                         
          AND ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE. A massive earthquake jolts the
          entire cave.
                         
          THE KILLING FLOOR
                         
          As Khalar Singh and Conan battle, the ground beneath them on
          the wide cave floor CRACKS and SPLINTERS.
                         
          THUMP-THUMP! The earthquake intensifies and the entire floor
          of the cave GIVES WAY, tumbling into an incredible abyss.
          Conan and Khalar alike grab onto the only rocks they can
          reach to prevent them from falling further.
           99.
                         
                         
          Conan ends up against one of the walls on the side of the
          cave. Khalar clings to the rocks on the edge of the sacred
          pool.
                         
          Their bodies are illuminated by a fiery glow. They look
          below, searching for the source of the glow.
                         
                         ACHERON
                         
          Another two hundred feet deep lies the golden spired city of
          ancient Acheron. The cave is but a forechamber, the slightest
          taste of the true glory and horror of Acheron.
                         
          And as they stare down into the ancient city, the shadows
          there MOVE.
                         
          Is it a trick of the light? No. Whatever the dark forms are,
          they are coming this way, climbing the tallest demonic spires
          and leaping impossibly far to climb up after Conan and Khalar
          Singh.
                         
          Khalar gazes down at the city with wide eyes.

                         THE ALTAR
                         
          Tamara, her body's blood nearly drained, is still shackled to
          the altar, which now teeters over the edge of chasm, poised
          to fall into the fiery depths.

                         CONAN
                         
          On the other side of the abyss, Conan spots her and scales
          the cave wall, up to a tiered plateau. He moves quickly,
          trying to get to Tamara.
                         
                         KHALAR SINGH
                         
          Khalar watches, entranced, as the first of the creatures
          rises out of the pit. They climb the walls like insects,
          clinging to the walls, their heads swiveling like a praying
          mantis.
                         
                         ACHERONIAN WARRIORS
                         
          The look like the statues above -- a hybrid -- part human,
          part demon. Their skin is a perfect black, armor carved of
          black bone, faces once human but now demonic with blood red
          eyes and gnashing teeth.
           100.
                         
                         
          They advance on Khalar Singh, who is furthest down now that
          Conan climbs upward towards Tamara.
                         
                          KHALAR SINGH
                          (IN ACHERONIAN)
           I am Khalar Singh, King of Acheron.
           I command you to kneel!
                         
          And this demonic horde advances right for him, their razor
          sharp teeth bared. Unsure, Khalar grips his tulwars tight.
          The demonic creatures draw close, and they -- kneel. They
          climb out of the abyss and immediately lower their heads
          before Khalar Singh.
                         
          Out of the corner of his eye, Khalar spots Conan, drawing
          near.

           Acheron!
                         
          But they do not rush to follow the order. They stir. One of
          them with more ornate bone armor than the rest looks over at
          Khalar's Guardsmen.

                          KHALAR SINGH
           Fine. Take your fill. I will kill

          Conan is on an intercept course with Tamara, leaping across
          chasms from statue to statue. Just below him, the first wave
          of Acheronian Warriors reach the Khalar's remaining
          Guardsmen.

          Khalar's Guardsmen, who have been watching the events with
          mouths agape, realize the danger too late. The horde of
          Acheronian Warriors leaps on them and a massive battle ensues
          between the demonic warriors and the soldiers.

          the cliffs of Cimmeria.

          Intercepts Conan just below the altar, his tulwars at the
          ready.
                         
                          CONAN
           Your story ends here.
                         
          The two warriors square off, fighting even as they cling to
          the statues.
                         
                         ACHERONIAN WARRIORS
                         
          The demon warriors not only slay Khalar's Guardsmen, but rip
          their still living bodies apart, dousing themselves in the
          blood of their victims. It is a violent ritual, both
          Bacchantic and gruesome.
                         
                         KHALAR
                         
          Launches himself at Conan, his tulwars sparking off the stone
          statuary. Conan leaps to another statue, parrying the blows.
          Khalar overextends himself, and Conan's sword just barely
          misses his throat.
                         
          Khalar pulls back, tries to settle himself. Conan's eyes
          narrow, he knows what Khalar is doing.
                         
                          CONAN (CONT'D)
           Like a woman, Fariq cried and
           begged me to spare him.
                         
          Khalar ROARS in rage, launching an all-out offensive. Conan
          backs up slowly, waiting for his moment.
                         
          And it comes quickly. Conan ducks below the tulwars and CUTS
          Khalar across the stomach. Khalar loses his balance and
          falls, one hand grabbing a protruding statue arm, dangling
          over the abyss.
                         
          Conan raises his sword to finish the job.
                         
           TAMARA (O.S.)
           Conan!!!
                         
          Conan glances down. The Acheronian Commander drank his fill,
          and now moves to the altar itself, his claw stroking Tamara's
          body. With one touch, the shackles open. He and the
          Acheronian Warriors drag her pale body toward the abyss.
                         
          Khalar grins up at him through bloody teeth.
           102.

           Cimmerian? Your father or your
           woman?
                         
          Conan leaps down to the altar. The Acheronian Warriors
          attack. Standing atop the altar, Conan cuts down all comers,
          cutting his way through the enemy, working his way to Tamara.
                         
                          CONAN
           Tamara!!
                         
          They leap on Conan, impossibly fast. They stab him. They cut
          him. But he does not stop. Even wounded, he throws them into
          the abyss.
                         
          And he reaches Tamara, just before the Commander drags her
          below. He grabs her arm. The Commander grabs her other arm,
          baring his shark-like teeth.
                         
          BLAM! Conan punches him in the mouth with his free hand and
          the Commander falls into the abyss.
                         
          The bloody Conan pulls Tamara up into his arms. Only for
          Tamara to scream.

          Conan spins just in time as Khalar strikes. Khalar's tulwar
          narrowly misses, and Conan counters. His father's sword runs
          Khalar Singh through.
                         
          Khalar's body falls into the abyss.
                         
          But the Acheronian Warriors surround them. Thousands climb
          out of the abyss, teeth bared, closing in on the wounded
          Conan. Tamara, badly weakened herself, grabs Conan.

          A tear falls from Tamara's face. The demonic warriors prepare
          to strike.
                         
          Conan drives his sword into Tamara's heart. The crown spikes
          retract and it falls from her head, tumbling into the abyss.
                         
          BOOM! A seismic explosion shakes everything, an unearthly
          GUST OF WIND pulling the Acheronian Warriors back down into

          We move in, closer and closer upon Conan's ice blue eyes, a
