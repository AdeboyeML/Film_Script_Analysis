               The year is 1815.                                         

               The French revolution is a distant                        
               memory. Napoleon has been defeated.                       
               France is ruled by a King again.

     RISE UP out of the iron-grey surface of the ocean, seething         
     in the wind, towards the shore. Winter rain slices the air.         
     Ahead, the port of Toulon, home of the French navy. A forest        
     of tall masted warships.                                            

     The great ships heave at anchor, the wind whipping their            
     rigging.                                                            

     Through the sea spray we see the great ribs of warships             
     under construction, and warships being refitted.

     Storm-lashed sea and driving rain. A great wave rises up
     and hammers down. As it recedes we see the figures of men
     heaving on great ropes, the sea water streaming down over           
     their faces. The harsh storm light catches glints of metal:
     these men are CONVICTS, chained by manacles, heads shaved,          
     wearing red shirts with prison numbers crudely stitched             
     onto them.                                                          

     Now we see that the ropes run up to a ship that is being            
     hauled ashore - a storm-damaged man-of-war, its masts
     broken, rising and falling on the surge.

     As yet another great wave rolls over the convicts, we
     follow the straining ropes down into the base of the                
     slipway, and find the convict JEAN VALJEAN, up to his waist         
     in water, chained by two sets of manacles, as the rain and          
     spray and wind scream round him. A great brute of a man, he         
     seems to feel nothing.                                              


                                                                         
                                                      2.


The convicts sing in time with the rhythmic pulls on the
rope -

          There's twenty years to go.

The camera RISES UP to find JAVERT, the officer in charge       
of the convict workforce, looking on, his face rain-lashed      
and expressionless. He stands above the men on the top of
the dock, as lines of convicts labour beneath him on the
steep steps of the dock wall.

Behind Javert, through the storm rain we glimpse a forest of   
half-built ships, their ribbed frames like great skeletons in   
the mist.                                                       

FOREGROUND convicts are at work on another ship that is
almost completed, labouring in the crashing spray.

          How long, O Lord
          Before you let me die?

                    CONVICTS                                      
          Look down, look down
          You'll always be a slave.
          Look down, look down
          You're standing in your grave.

With a last great heave the lines of convicts haul the            
damaged ship onto the slipway.                                    

CRACK! The stern flagpole of the ship snaps in a vicious gust     
of wind and crashes down into the shallow water near Valjean.     
Javert sees and points his stick at Valjean in silent             
command. Valjean stares back for a beat, defying him. Then he     
drops down into the seething water and re-emerges with the        
great mast in his hands, held over his head. His head breaks      
water with his bitter gaze still on Javert, as he throws the      
mast ashore in a deliberate display of strength.                  

Javert nods to the guards, and they begin to form the
chained men into lines to return to their prison. The storm
is passing now, blown by the driving wind.

Javert approaches Jean Valjean.

                    VALJEAN
          Yes. It means I'm free.

                    JAVERT
          No! It means you get                                    
          Your yellow ticket-of-leave.

He hands Valjean a folded yellow paper.                           

                    JAVERT
          This badge of shame
          You'll show it everywhere.
          It warns you're a dangerous man.                        

                    VALJEAN
          I stole a loaf of bread

              the law.

                        VALJEAN
              I know the meaning of those
              nineteen years
              A slave of the law!

                        JAVERT
              Five years for what you did,
              The rest because you tried to
              run.
              Yes, 24601!

                        VALJEAN
              My name is Jean Valjean!

                        JAVERT
              And I'm Javert!
              Do not forget my name.
              Do not forget me -
              24601!

    He strides away to command the lines of convicts as they're
    marched away. Valjean walks away, hardly able to take in            
    that he is free at last.

    The convicts sing as he goes.                                       

                        CONVICTS

2   EXT. ROAD OUT OF TOULON - DAWN                                2

    Valjean makes his way up a rising track, a worn knapsack on
    his back. He comes to a stop at the top of the hill, and
    there before him, lit by the rising sun, spreads a wide
    vista of fields and towns and villages, stretching into the
    distance, with the snow capped Alps beyond. Behind and
    below him lies Toulon at the sea's edge. As we hear the
    musical theme ('Freedom is Mine'), we see for the first
    time the darkness in his face give way to a new hope.

     Valjean strides down the long rising road, pulling his thin
     coat close round him against the cold winter wind.

     He passes a long line of labourers working. He approaches           
     the OVERSEER.

6    EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - END OF DAY                               6

     Valjean slogs on up the rising track into the mountains.
     Snow on the ground here, and darkness falling.

     He looks up and sees ahead a village built on a rock cliff,
     its lights twinkling, the snowy mountains rising behind.
     The tower of its handsome church rises up like a promise of
     refuge. This is Digne.

     a guard standing outside the Mairie.                            
                                                            6.

     Valjean stands waiting. The officer fastidiously writes down        
     the name of Valjean in his huge ledger and the name of the          
     town in his passport. The officer signs and stamps the              
     passport.

7    INT. COUNTRY INN, DIGNE - DUSK                                7

     Valjean sits in the corner, his hat low over his head. He
     eyes hungrily a group of cart drivers tucking into a roast
     meal by a roaring fire place. The innkeeper serves him a
     beer. As he reaches for it his coat sleeve rides up to
     reveal his wrist, calloused and scarred by manacles. The
     innkeeper eyes him warily. He discusses Valjean with two
     other men, then asks for his paper. Sees the phrase
     "Extremely Dangerous".                                              

     VALJEAN'S POV - From the yellow paper in the innkeeper's
     hands up to the innkeeper's face. A blank stare, a shrug of

7A   EXT. DIGNE - NIGHT                                           7A

     Valjean moves off wearily through the village. As he passes
     down the narrow street, faces peer at him from doorways,
     but the doors close when he goes by. A shadowy figure
     follows him. Word has spread that he's a `dangerous man'.

     Passing the uncurtained window of a cottage, he comes to a
     stop. Through the window he sees a scene that breaks his
     heart: a father at a table by lamplight, his young wife
     before him, his children on either side. Nothing special,
     and yet everything he's never had.


8    EXT. PRISON, DIGNE - NIGHT                                    8

     He stops at the local jail. An iron chain attached to a bell
     hangs from the prison door. He rings. A grate slides open.
                                                           7.


                         VALJEAN
               Jailer. Would you let me stay here                        
               for tonight?

                         JAILER                                          
               This is a prison, not an inn. Get
               yourself arrested. Then we will
               open up for you.

     The grate slides shut. As Jean Valjean walks away, some
     children who have been following begin throwing stones at
     him. He threatens them with his stick and they scatter.


8A   EXT. DIGNE - NIGHT                                           8A

     He sees over a garden wall a low doorway in a stone turret.         
     Valjean stoops through the doorway and lies down on some            
     straw. He hears a ferocious growl and sees the head of an
     enormous mastiff. It is a dog kennel.


8B   EXT. DIGNE - NIGHT                                           8B

     Snow falling as Valjean makes his way down the road, hungry,
     weary, moving slowly, his trousers ripped and bloody from
     where the dog has bitten him.

     At the end of a road, the snow-covered church; beside it, a
     dark churchyard.                                                    


9    EXT. CHURCH YARD, DIGNE - NIGHT                               9

     Snow-covered gravestones in moonlight. Exhausted, Valjean
     collapses to the ground and huddles himself into the
     shelter of a doorway.                                               

     A lantern glows in the dark. The lantern approaches,
     throwing shadows. Its little circle of light comes to rest
     on the crumpled figure of Valjean.

     He stirs and opens his eyes.

     VALJEAN'S POV - The glow of the lantern in the darkness.
     Beyond it, the half-seen features of a kind old man. The            
     BISHOP.

                         BISHOP
               Come in, sir, for you are weary
               And the night is cold out here.
               Though our lives are very humble
               What we have we have to share.

     Bewildered, fearful, suspicious, Valjean gets up and goes
     with the Bishop into the house by the church.                       
                                                           8.


10   INT. BISHOP'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                10     

     A simple table on which is laid out bread and wine, with          
     silver cutlery. Two silver candlesticks light the room,           
     illuminating walls painted with religious scenes. The Bishop      
     ushers the bewildered Valjean into the room. The bishop's         
     sister Madame Baptistine stands. Valjean hesitates.               

                         BISHOP
               There is wine here to revive you.
               There is bread to make you
               strong.
               There's a bed to rest till
               morning -
               Rest from pain, and rest from
               wrong.

               Sit, my brother.

     The Bishop gestures to the housekeeper Madame Magloire.

                         BISHOP
               Madame, set one more place.
                   (to Valjean)
               Please sit.

     The Bishop gently takes his arm and draws him into a chair.

     Valjean sits, and the Housekeeper lays food before him.
     Famished, Valjean eats like an animal. The Bishop says a
     short grace.

                         BISHOP
               May the Lord bless the food we eat                      
               today. Bless our dear sister and                        
               our honoured guest.
                   (To Valjean)
               Please, eat. Where are you
               travelling to my brother?

                         VALJEAN
               Pontarlier.

                         BISHOP
               Is that where your family is?

                         VALJEAN
               No. The destination is compulsory.
               That is where the Law sends me. I
               have no home.

                         BISHOP
               Then let this be your home, for
               as long as you need it.
                                                              9.


11   INT. BEDROOM, BISHOP'S HOUSE - NIGHT                          11

     The Bishop leads Valjean to a bedroom where the walls are
     also painted with religious imagery. Across the passage,
     Valjean sees the open door to the Bishop's own bedroom.
     There the Housekeeper is putting the table silver away in a
     cupboard.

     He turns to see a bed made up with clean white linen
     waiting for him. He hasn't slept in such a bed ever in his
     life. But the Bishop is smiling, offering it to him.

                         BISHOP
               Sleep well. Tomorrow morning
               before you leave you will have a
               cup of milk from our cows, nice
               and hot.

     The Bishop turns away to go to sleep.

                         VALJEAN
               You let me sleep here next to you?
               How do you know I'm not a murderer?

     Valjean laughs a strange laugh.

                         BISHOP
               God will take care of that.

     LATER THAT NIGHT -

     Valjean lies on the bed, fully dressed, deeply asleep.

     Outside a dog barks.

     Valjean's eyes snap open. The first thing he sees by the
     light of the moon is an image of God the Father gazing down
     on him from the painted ceiling. In panic, fearing
     judgement, he sits bolt upright. Then he looks round, and
     remembers. He gets out of bed, and opens the door.

     There, across the narrow passage, the door stands open to
     the Bishop's bedroom. In the moonlight, he sees the Bishop
     lying asleep. Above his bed, the cupboard where the silver
     is kept.

     Valjean moves silently into the Bishop's room, holding a             
     metal miner's spike which he pulls from his bag. The floor           
     boards creak. He looks down at the old man, holding his
     breath, but the bishop is peacefully and innocently asleep.
     He reaches up to the cupboard. It is unlocked. The cupboard          
     door opens with a sharp cracking sound. The Bishop,                  
     disturbed in his sleep, moves a little. At once Valjean is
     over him, like a wild animal, spike raised to strike should          
     he wake. The Bishop sleeps on. The moon comes out and
     lights up his beautific, smiling face. Valjean is thrown.
     He turns back and opens the cupboard door fully: there is
     the silver.
                                                          10.


     Carefully he picks it out, fearful of every clink. One last         
     look at the sleeping old man, and he makes a run for the
     door.


12   EXT. CHURCHYARD - NIGHT                                      12     

     Valjean rushes out of the back door of the house. He                
     crosses the graveyard, scrambles over a back wall, and he's         
     gone.


13   INT. BISHOP'S HOUSE - DAY                                    13     

     The Bishop is coming in from morning Mass in his vestments          
     when the door bursts open and two policemen drag Valjean
     before him. Valjean hangs his head, unable to meet the
     Bishop's eyes.

                         CONSTABLE
               Monsignor, we caught the thief
               red-handed! He has the nerve to
               say you gave him all this!

     He upends Valjean's kitbag, and the silver tumbles out.

     The Bishop looks from the silver to Valjean.

                         BISHOP
               That is right.

     Amazed, Valjean looks up.

                         BISHOP
               But my friend, you left so early,
               You forgot I gave these also.
               Would you leave the best behind?

     The old Bishop is holding out the two silver candlesticks.

                         BISHOP
                   (to policemen)
               Messieurs, release him.
               For this man has spoken true.
               I commend you for your duty
               Now God's blessing go with you.

     Silenced by the Bishop's gentle tones, the policemen turn
     and leave.

     Valjean, utterly bewildered, takes the silver candlesticks.

                         BISHOP
               But remember this, my brother -
               See in this some higher plan.
               You must use this precious silver
               To become an honest man.

     Valjean kneels in the church.                                     

     He takes out his yellow passport and stares at it.                

     He turns towards the altar, and the crucifix above it.

                         VALJEAN
               What have I done?
               Sweet Jesus, what have I done?
               Become a thief in the night
               Become a dog on the run!
               And have I fallen so far
               And is the hour so late
               That nothing remains but the cry
               of my hate?
               The cries in the dark that nobody
               hears
               Here where I stand at the turning
               of the years.

               If there's another way to go
               I missed it twenty long years
               ago.
               My life was a war that could
               never be won.
               They gave me a number and
               murdered Valjean
               When they chained me and left me
               for dead
               Just for stealing a mouthful of
               bread!

               He treated me like any other
               He gave me his trust
               He called me brother.
               My life he claims for God
               above...
               Can such things be?

               Take an eye for an eye!
               Turn your heart into stone!

               Beneath the lash, upon the rack.

               life?

     Slowly, he examines the yellow passport and raises it high,         
     as if to the altar.

     Valjean comes out of the church into the graveyard and              
     reaches a bell set on the edge of a promontory. Below lies          
     the steep drop down the mountainside to the dark valley

     He rips the yellow paper into pieces and throws the pieces
     out over the valley. The scraps flutter in the wind.

     FOLLOW the scraps of yellow paper as they dance in the wind
     then fall away into the void below. One scrap of paper              
     dances upwards in the sunlight. We follow this and                  
     accelerate upwards leaving Valjean and the town of Digne            
     far below, towards the sun gloriously breaking through the          
     heavens with the alps beyond. The camera then starts to

          You must send the slut away
          Or we're all going to end in the
          gutter
          And it's us who'll have to pay
          At the end of the day!

The Foreman pulls Fantine away.                                

                    FOREMAN

          Ah yes, the virtuous Fantine
          Who keeps herself so pure and
          clean -
          You'd be the cause, I had no
          doubt

               Right, my girl! On your way!

     Below, Fantine turns and calls to Valjean in his office
     above with a pitiful cry.

                         FANTINE
               M'sieur Mayor, help me! I have a
               child!

     Valjean hears the cry, but he has other concerns. He turns
     round to face Javert.                                               

     Javert stares at him.

     On the factory floor below, the Foreman hustles Fantine
     out, as she struggles against him.

                         JAVERT

               Let all beware.

                         VALJEAN
               Welcome, sir
               Come guard our laws
               I'm sure we're here
               In common cause.

     Javert turns to look through the high window onto the men's         
     factory floor below. The last men are leaving for the day.          

                         JAVERT
               You've done the city proud,

     Valjean shows some demonstration samples of their work.

                           VALJEAN
                 The dignity of toil
                 To stay alive.

     Javert is puzzled. He's sure he recognises Valjean, but
     from where?

                           JAVERT
                 It seems to me
                 We may have met.

     Valjean throws him a sharp glance.

                           VALJEAN
                 Your face is not a face
                 I would forget.

     A CRASH from outside in the yard - shouts -


24   EXT. TRACK LEADING TO FACTORY, MONTREUIL - DAY               24

     Valjean and Javert hurry out across the factory yard and
     down the muddy track beyond to discover -

     A heavily laden cart has toppled onto the cart driver -             
     Fauchelevent, the worker seen before taking a rest on a
     crate.

     The   cart driver and the Foreman are trying to lift the cart
     off   the crushed man, but it's too heavy, and the ground is
     too   soft. Fauchelevent screams as the cart slowly sinks in
     the   mud.

     Valjean, Javert and Javert's assistant all hurry to help,
     but they can't get a proper purchase in the spongy ground.
     All the time the cart is sinking further, pushing
     Fauchelevent deeper into the mud that will soon bury him.
     Then Valjean sees a way. At one end the wheels of the cart
     have stopped sinking - the ground is harder here. He throws
     himself under the cart at this higher end, and braces
     himself to lift it from beneath.

                           VALJEAN
                 Get back! It may fall!

                           FOREMAN
                 No, Monsieur le Mayor!

                           CROWD
                 It'll kill you as well!
                                                     21.


Javert stands back and looks on. As he looks, we see a
memory stirring in him.

JAVERT'S POV - Valjean's posture beneath the cart is
exactly the same as the convict beneath the fallen mast.
The same crouching power. The same almost-suicidal
determination.

Valjean sees Javert looking at him, and knows exactly what
he's thinking. For a moment he hesitates. Then he hears
Fauchelevent's choking scream as the mud gags his mouth.
Valjean strains every muscle, and slowly one end of the
cart begins to rise. As soon as it clears the crushed and
gasping man, the others pull him clear.

Valjean lets the cart down again, and climbs out. As he
brushes himself down he finds Javert staring at him.

                    JAVERT
          Can this be true?
          I don't believe what I see!
          A man your age
          To be as strong as you are!
          A memory stirs...                                    
          You make me think of a man                           
          From years ago                                       
          A man who broke his parole..                         
          He disappeared.                                      

He shakes his head, realising how absurd his suspicions
are.

                    JAVERT
          Forgive me, sir.
          I would not dare -

                    VALJEAN
          Say what you must.
          Don't leave it there.

Valjean holds Javert's gaze, challenging him to say more.      
Javert is not yet confident enough to continue.                

Valjean goes to help Fauchelevent.                             

                    VALJEAN                                    
          Let me help you up.                                  

Fauchelevent groans as he rises.                               

                    FAUCHELEVENT
          Monsieur le Mayor, you come from
          God!
          You are a saint!

                    VALJEAN                                    
          No more cart driving for you!                        
                                                             22.


     Javert stares. He can't rid himself of his suspicion.

                         JAVERT
               Monsieur le Mayor.

     He draws himself up and gives a bow. As he walks away, he            
     discusses something with his assistant.

     Fantine makes her way to the harbour wall. Beggars shelter in   
     the tunnels under the red brick buildings.                      


26   EXT. RED LIGHT DISTRICT, MONTREUIL - NIGHT                    26

     Fantine makes her way down   wet slimy steps. This leads to an       
     alleyway that runs down to   the harbour and three ships lying       
     on the mud at low tide. At   the far end, the largest is the         
     rotting hulk of a vast old   warship. A single whore sits in a       
     doorway.

     Drunken sailors spill out into the alleyway below. The               
     first sailor is trying to find the whorehouse.                       

                         SAILOR 1

               In that harbour over there!

     They spot Fantine, mistaking her for a whore. Fantine presses   
     on down the steps, trying to ignore the sailors.                

                         SAILOR 2
               Lovely ladies!

               Seven months at sea can make you

     The sailors then see whores start to appear from the shadows         
     of warehouse doorways.

A man with no legs, reacting to the sailors, cranks up an        
organ-grinder and from doorways and overhead windows             
harbour whores appear and tout for business.                     

A man selling dentures stands by his cart and we hear

During the above chorus, Fantine sells a locket containing a     
cutting of Cosette's hair to the pawnbroker.

          It's worth at least ten.                               

The pawnbroker goes back in his shop and Fantine watches the     
whores.

          Alright, five.                                         

The pawnbroker takes the locket in exchange for the money.       

An old woman leers at Fantine from the shadows, beckoning.       
She approaches Fantine, reaching out to stroke her hair.

                    HAIR CRONE

      The hair crone leads Fantine down to her shop at the base of         
      the stairs.                                                          

      Fantine is sat on a low stool. She bows her head before the          
      hair crone, who at once whips out a razor blade and cuts             
      off her hair at the roots.

     trying pathetically to attract custom. Then she comes to a
     stop, staring. She has seen and recognised Valjean, some
     way off. He's out in the harbour district. He is talking to       
     a beggar. Before he moves on, he hands over some money.           

     As Fantine watches Valjean on his mission of mercy, a well-
     dressed young man, BAMATABOIS, comes up to her. He arrives        
     with two friends and a valet.                                     
                                                     30.


                    BAMATABOIS
          Here's something new. I think
          I'll give it a try.
          Come closer, you! I like to see
          what I buy.
          The usual price
          For just one slice of your pie.                       

                    FANTINE
          I don't want you! No! No,
          M'sieur! Let me go!

                    BAMATABOIS
          Is this a trick? I won't pay
          more!

                    FANTINE
          No, not at all!                                       

                    BAMATABOIS
          You've got some nerve, you little
          slut!
          You've got some gall!                                 
          It's the same with a tart as it is                    
          with a grocer                                         
          The customer sees what he gets in                     
          advance                                               
          It's not for the whore to say "yes                    
          sir" or "no sir"                                      
          It's not for the harlot to pick and                   
          to choose or to lead me a dance!                      

He pulls her clothing open and laughingly stuffs snow down      
her cleavage. Fantine reacts with fury. They fall over in the   
snow and Bamatabois laughs.                                     

                    FANTINE
          I'll kill you, you bastard!
          Try any of that!
          Even a whore who has gone to the
          bad
          Won't be had by a rat!                                

Fantine scratches Bamatabois across the face. Bamatabois        
touches his face and sees the blood on his fingers. His         
friends drag Fantine against the harbour wall.                  

                    BAMATABOIS
              (furious but aroused)                             
          By Christ you'll pay for what
          you've done!
          This rat will make you bleed,
          you'll see!
          I guarantee I'll make you suffer!
          For this disturbance of the peace
          For this insult to life and
          property!
                                                     31.


Bamatabois suddenly sees that police have arrived.            

                    FANTINE
          I beg you, don't report me, sir.
          I'll do whatever you may want.                      

                    BAMATABOIS
          Make your excuse to the police!

Bamatabois' friend drags Fantine towards the police. It's     
Javert.

                    JAVERT
          Tell me quickly what's the story.
          Who saw what and why and where?
          Let him give a full description,
          Let him answer to Javert!
          In this nest of whores and vipers
          Let one speak who saw it all.
          Who laid hands on this good man
          here?
          What's the substance of this
          brawl?

                    BAMATABOIS
          Javert, would you believe it?                       
          I was walking, it was dark
          When this prostitute attacked me
          You can see she's left her mark!

He shows the blood. Javert turns to Fantine.

                    JAVERT
          She will answer for her actions
          When you make a full report.
          You may rest assured, M'sieur,
          That she will answer to the
          court.

Fantine is almost fainting with fear, still racked with
occasional spasms of coughing. Unseen by her, Valjean is
approaching from behind. Javert's assistants pick Fantine     
up. Javert covers his mouth with a handkerchief as he         
approaches Fantine.                                           

                    FANTINE
          There's a child who sorely needs
          me,
          Please, m'sieur, she's but that
          high.
          Holy God, is there no mercy?
          If I go to jail she'll die.                         

                    JAVERT
          I have heard such protestations
          Every day for twenty years.
          Let's have no more explanations,
                    (more)
                                                     32.

                    JAVERT (cont'd)
          Save your breath and save your
          tears.

Javert indicates to the two policemen to drag Fantine away.     

Valjean steps out of the shadows.

                    VALJEAN
          A moment of your time, Javert.
          I do believe this woman's tale.

                    JAVERT
          Monsieur le Mayor!                                    

                    VALJEAN
          You've done your duty. Let her
          be.
          She needs a doctor, not a jail.

                    JAVERT
          Monsieur le Mayor!                                    

Javert looks on, containing his anger, as Valjean reaches
out a hand to Fantine. To Fantine, it's as if he's come to
her in a dream -

                    FANTINE
          Can this be?

                    VALJEAN
          Where will she end -
          This child without a friend?

He holds Fantine's hands, looking into her face.

                    VALJEAN
          I've seen your face before.
          Show me some way to help you.
          How have you come to grief
          In such a place as this?

                    FANTINE
          M'sieur, don't mock me now, I
          pray
          It's hard enough I've lost my
          pride.
          You let your foreman send me
          away.
          Yes, you were there
          And turned aside.
          I never did no wrong.

                    VALJEAN
          Is it true what I've done -

                    FANTINE
          My daughter's close to dying.
                                                          33.


                         VALJEAN
               - to an innocent soul?

                         FANTINE
               If there's a God above -

                         VALJEAN
               Had I only known then!

                         FANTINE
               He'd let me die instead.

                         VALJEAN
               In His name my task has just begun.
               I will her to the hospital.                             

     Valjean picks Fantine up in his arms.                             

     Javert is quietly coldly furious.

                         JAVERT

               Where is she?

                         FANTINE
               At an inn in Montfermeil...

                         JAVERT

     As Valjean and Fantine move away, Javert stares after them,       
     then turns and quietly instructs his assistant to follow          
     after them.                                                       


30   EXT. POLICE STATION, MONTREUIL - DAY                       30     

     As Javert walks up the steps to his police station his            
     assistant stops him with an urgent letter.                        

                         JAVERT'S ASSISTANT
               From Paris, Monsieur.

     Javert seizes it, opens it, and reads. As he reads, his
     expression changes. Appalled, he realizes he's made a
     terrible mistake.
                                                          34.


31   INT. FACTORY, MONTREUIL - NIGHT                              31

     Valjean is at his desk in his office, going through his
     papers once everyone else has gone, when Javert enters and          
     stands before him. He looks up.

                         JAVERT
               Monsieur le Mayor
               I have a crime to declare!
               I have disgraced
               The uniform that I wear.
               I've done you wrong,
               Let no forgiveness be shown.
               I've been as hard
               On every rogue I have known.
               I'll bear the blame,
               I must be treated
               Just the same.

                         VALJEAN
               I don't understand.
               What is this crime, Javert?

                         JAVERT
               I mistook you for a convict,
               I have made a false report.
               Now I learn they've caught the
               culprit -
               He's about to face the court.

     Valjean conceals his shock.

                         JAVERT
               And of course the thief denies
               it,
               You'd expect that from a con.
               But he couldn't run for ever,
               No, not even Jean Valjean.

                         VALJEAN
               You say this man denies it all,
               And gives no sign of
               understanding or repentance?
               You say this man is going to
               trial,
               And that he's sure to be returned
               to serve his sentence?

                         JAVERT
               He will pay, and so must I.
               Press charges against me, sir!

                         VALJEAN
               You have only done your duty
               It's a minor sin at most.
               All of us have been mistaken                              
               You'll return, sir, to your post.
                                                           35.


                          JAVERT
                Must I do as you say?

                          VALJEAN
                It's your duty to obey!

      Javert is about to protest again, but Valjean raises one
      commanding hand, to indicate his decision is made. Javert
      gives an abrupt bow, and departs.

      Left alone, Valjean paces his office, deeply disturbed.

                          VALJEAN
                They think that man is me -
                Without a second glance.
                This stranger they have found -
                This man could be my chance!

                Why should I save his hide?
                Why should I right this wrong?
                When I have come so far
                And struggled for so long?

                If I speak I am condemned.
                If I stay silent, I am damned!

      He goes out onto the balcony that looks down on the empty           
      factory.

                          VALJEAN
                I am the master of hundreds of
                workers -
                They all look to me.
                Can I abandon them?
                How would they live
                If I am not free?

                If I speak they are condemned.
                If I stay silent, I am damned!

      Valjean hesitates outside the courtroom and in the lobby of          
      the courtroom, pacing back and forth.                                

                          VALJEAN
                My soul belongs to God, I know,
                I made that bargain long ago.
                He gave me hope when hope was
                gone!
                He gave me strength to journey
                on!
                Who am I?
                Who am I?
                I'm Jean Valjean!

      Valjean pushes through the crowds at the back of the                 
      courtroom.

      The man accused of being Jean Valjean, a wretched down-and-
      out, stands before the JUDGE. He looks uncannily like the            
      real Valjean. Before the judge has a chance to speak, the            
      doors open and Valjean bursts in. Sensation in the court.

                          VALJEAN
                And so, your honour, you see it's
                true
                That man bears no more guilt than
                you!
                Who am I?
                24601!
                                                          37.


     The judge is too stunned to respond. The others in the              
     court can't believe what they've just heard. The Mayor of
     Montreuil-sur-Mer, a convict!

                         VALJEAN
               If you don't believe me ask
               Inspector Javert. He knows where to
               find me.

     The judge goes over to Valjean and gently leads him out.            

                         JUDGE

33   INT. HOSPITAL, MONTREUIL - NIGHT                             33     

     The hospital is in the long attic of Valjean's factory.             

     Valjean hurries into the hospital, breathless. He sees a
     nursing sister outside Fantine's room.

                         VALJEAN
               Is her daughter with her?

                         NURSE
               No, monsieur. Her guardian sent
               this.

     She gives Valjean a note. He reads it with mounting anger.

                         VALJEAN
               `Money not enough. Send more.
               Thenardier.' What sort of man is
               this?

     Fantine lies in bed, delirious. She is dressed in pure              
     white. Her eyes are closed.                                         

                         FANTINE

               You've played the day away
               And soon it will be night.

     Fantine's eyes open and she sees Cosette, playing in the            
     room. She looks healthy and is dressed prettily.                    

               Come to me, Cosette, the light is
               fading.

          Don't you see, the evening star                      
          appearing?                                           
          Come to me, and rest against my                      
          shoulder,                                            
          How fast the minutes fly away and                    
          every minute colder?                                 

Valjean enters, and sees at once that Fantine is close to      
the end. He drops to his knees by her bed.

                     VALJEAN
          Dear Fantine, Cosette will be

          - shall live in my protection.

                    FANTINE
          Take her now!

She pushes into his hand a scrap of paper on which she's
written her wishes.

                    VALJEAN
          Your child will want for nothing.

                     FANTINE
          Good m'sieur, you come from God
          in heaven.

                    VALJEAN
          And none shall ever harm Cosette
          as long as I am living.

Fantine has stopped looking towards the window. All her
fading strength is now directed towards Valjean. She tries
to reach up to him.

                    FANTINE
          Take my hand...
          The night grows ever colder.
                                                     39.


                    VALJEAN
          Then I will keep you warm.

He wraps her in his arms.

                    FANTINE
          Take my child
          I give her to your keeping.

                    VALJEAN
          Take shelter from the storm.

                    FANTINE
          For God's sake, please stay till
          I am sleeping...
          And tell Cosette I love her
          And I'll see her when I wake...

Fantine starts to spasm. She sees something over Valjean's      
shoulder. Valjean doesn't realise. Her eyes go glassy as        
she passes away. Valjean then hears the unforgettable voice     
of Javert behind him.                                           

                    JAVERT

          We see each other plain!
          `M'sieur le Mayor'
          You'll wear a different chain!

Valjean stands to face Javert.                                  

                     VALJEAN
          Before you say another word,
          Javert,
          Before you chain me up like a
          slave again,
          Listen to me! There is something
          I must do.
          This woman leaves behind a
          suffering child.
          There is none but me who can
          intercede -
          In mercy's name, three days are
          all I need,
          Then I'll return, I pledge my
          word!
          Then I'll return...

Javert draws his sword and aims it at Valjean.                  

                    JAVERT                                      
          You must think me mad!
          I've hunted you across the years.
          Men like you can never change -
          A man such as you!

Valjean breaks a section of timber beam from the roof.          
                                                     40.


The men start to circle each other.                              

They sing at the same time, duelling in song.

                    VALJEAN
          Believe of me what you will
          There is a duty that I'm sworn to
          do.
          You know nothing of my life -
          All I did was steal some bread.
          You know nothing of the world -
          You would sooner see me dead.
          But not before I see this justice
          done!

          My duty is to the law.
          You have no rights.
          Come with me, 24601!

The two men fight.                                               

                    VALJEAN
          I am warning you, Javert,
          I'm a stronger man by far!
          There is power in me yet!
          My race is not yet run!

                    JAVERT                                       
          Now the wheel has turned around -
          Jean Valjean is nothing now.
          Dare you talk to me of crime
          And the price you had to pay.
          Every man is born in sin
          Every man must choose his way.

Javert disarms Valjean and drives him backwards towards an       
attic door.                                                      

          You know nothing of Javert!
          I was born inside a jail.
          I was born with scum like you.
          I am from the gutter too.

Valjean is pushed through the doors out onto a wooden            
loading platform beneath a hoist. Below, the walls of the        
factory lead straight down to the black sea at high tide.        
Javert is triumphant.                                            

Valjean glances down and pushes back, dropping into the          
darkness of the ocean.                                           

Javert goes to jump after him and cannot bring himself to do     
it.

      Javert stares into the black sea - there is no sign of                
      Valjean.

      Valjean, dripping wet, watches from a tunnel under a factory,   
      as Fantine's body wrapped in a shroud is dumped on a cart.      

      They sing to themselves, continuing their duet without                
      knowing.

      The village street is bright with booths set up for a Frost
      Fair. Families and visitors are out buying baubles, or                
      laughing at the antics of travelling players. Small girls             
      cluster round a stall that displays prettily-dressed dolls.           
      Amongst them is a prettily-dressed girl of 8 or 9 years:              
      EPONINE.                                                              

      Across the road from this stall stands a shabby inn. A                
      sign lashed to an old cart swinging in the wind reveals the           
      inn to be `The Sergeant of Waterloo'. The inn is still                
      closed despite the small crowd at the fair.                           

      MOVE IN on the frosted window of the inn, through which we            
      see a little girl, COSETTE, gazing out at the display of
      dolls.

     Cosette is in the process of sweeping the floor. She's come
     to a stop, gazing out of the window, mesmerized by the              
     sight of the most beautiful doll in the display, and                
     jealous that Eponine can see it and touch it up close.              

                         COSETTE
               There is a castle on a cloud
               I like to go there in my sleep.
               Aren't any floors for me to
               sweep,
               Not in my castle on a cloud.

     Cosette gets out from a hiding place in the wall a knotted          
     grimy rag - this is her "doll", the knot is the doll's head.        

               There is a lady all in white
               Holds me and sings a lullaby.

          that!

Madame Thenardier sees that Cosette far from going is             
hiding behind the far wall. We see Cosette's frightened           
eyes peering out from a tiny gap in this wall.

The innkeeper's gang posing as customers who have been

      Thenardier comes out of the inn, backed by a posse of his
      gang of loyal customers, and takes control of a brass band to   
      sing to the Frost Fair.

      Further down the street, carrying her empty buckets, Cosette
      turns to look sadly back at the cheery sight.

      The Portly Customer has discovered he's been robbed. He

      once two of Thenardier's thugs grab him and hustle him off.

      Madame Thenardier approaches a handsome soldier who is             
      drinking at a table by the fire in the inn. She sits on his        
      lap and gets him to look back at Thenardier, so allowing her       
      to see inside his coat and spot his wallet.                        

                          MADAME THENARDIER
                I used to dream
                That I would meet a prince
                But God almighty
                Have you seen what's happened
                since?
                `Master of the house'
                Isn't worth my spit!
                Comforter, philosopher

                Cunning little brain
                Regular Voltaire
                Thinks he's quite a lover
                But there's not much there.

      As Madame Thenardier reaches for the man's groin, she lifts        
      his wallet skillfully and hands it off to Monsieur                 
      Thenardier.

                What a cruel trick of nature
                Landed me with such a louse.
                God knows how I've lasted
                Living with this bastard in the
                house!

      She pulls the young man into a dance, enabling her to steal        
      everything else of value he has. Father Christmas has also         
      been lured from the frost fair and the Thenardiers slit his        
      presents sack and exchange it for a sack containing snow.

42      EXT. WOOD BY THE INN - NIGHT                                 42

        Cosette has filled her buckets at the well in the wood, and
        is now heading back. Through the dark trees ahead we glimpse
        the cheerful lights of the Frost Fair and the distant inn.
        She goes slowly, because the buckets are heavy. She hums to
        herself to keep her spirits up, a wordless verse of `Castle
        on a Cloud'.

        After a few steps she pauses to rest the weight of the
        buckets.

        Strong arms reach for the buckets and lift them out of her
        hands. She looks up, amazed. There's Valjean.

                            VALJEAN
                  Hush now, do not be afraid of me.

               Cosette?

     She gazes up at him. Hardly knowing why, the little girl
     trusts this stranger. Valjean picks up the heavy buckets, and
     they head back towards the inn. As they go, they hum `Castle
     on a Cloud' together.

     Valjean enters with Cosette. Madame Thenardier hurries             
     over. Madame and Monsieur Thenardier try to thieve from            
     Valjean using the same tricks established earlier, but he          
     evades every attempt. Eponine watches silently from a              
     corner.

                         VALJEAN
               I found her wandering in the wood
               This little child, I found her
               trembling in the shadows.
               And I am here to help Cosette,
               And I will settle any debt you
               may think proper.

               To take Cosette away.

               This is a duty I must heed.

          Cosette -
          Dear Fantine - gone to rest -
          Have we done for her child what
          is best?
          Shared our bread - shared each
          bone -
          Treated her like she's one of our
          own!
          Like our own, m'sieur!

                    VALJEAN
          Your feelings do you credit, sir.
          And I will ease the parting blow.
          Let us not talk of bargains and
          bones and greed.

He gives Thenardier money.

                    VALJEAN
          Now may I say we are agreed?

                    MADAME THENARDIER
          That would quite fit the bill
          If she hadn't so often been ill.
          Little dear, cost us dear!
          Medicines are expensive, m'sieur.
          Not that we begrudged a sou -
          It's no more than we Christians
          must do.

Valjean gives more money.
                                                           52.

               One thing more! One small doubt!
               There are treacherous people
               about!
               No offence! Please reflect!

               correct!

     Valjean hands over more money.

                          VALJEAN
               No more! Here's your price!
               Fifteen hundred for your
               sacrifice.
               Come, Cosette, say goodbye.
               Let's seek out some friendlier
               sky.
               Thank you both for Cosette -

     Both Thenardiers shake their heads.

     Javert stares once, contemptuously, round the seedy inn,
     and departs without a further word. Thenardier goes to the
     doorway to watch him leave.

      that she's comfortable. Then he puts his head out of the
      window. At the gate into Paris, soldiers are checking              
      documents of occupants of carriages.                               

      Valjean slips out of the carriage with Cosette and makes           
      his way along the wall, away from the gate.

46C   EXT. PARIS - RIVER SEINE - NIGHT                           46C     

      Valjean and Cosette turn down a narrow street, no longer           
      hurrying.                                                          

      The narrow street turns, and opens out onto the river.             
      Valjean stops. There, on the other side of the river, in the       
      light of a lamp, stands Javert.                                    
                                                          55.

48   EXT. MAZE OF OLD STREETS - NIGHT                           48     

     Now Valjean and Cosette are running - down narrow alleys,
     into small dark courtyards, not knowing which way to turn.
     Whenever Valjean thinks they've thrown their pursuer, there
     he is, not far behind. And he's no longer alone. With him
     are a detachment of soldiers.                                     

     Javert and his team never seem to run. But he's always            
     there.


49   EXT. DEAD END - NIGHT                                      49

     Valjean and Cosette turn into a street that is walled in by
     high windowless houses. They follow it round a corner to
     find - a dead end. A high wall before them. They're
     trapped.

     Valjean looks round. No way out. Then he sees a nearby lamp
     bracket. Hanging from it is the rope that is used to lower
     the oil lamp for lighting. He tears off the rope and ties
     one end round Cosette, beneath her armpits. Then holding
     the other end, he scales the wall, using the corner to
     brace himself as he rises. Once on the top, he hauls
     Cosette up by the rope. Only then does he turn to look down
     onto the other side.

     A cloister. A building in the middle, windows glowing.
     Grave stones black against the white snow. The sound of
     women's voices, singing a psalm.

                         NUNS

               Sis praesul et custodia...

     Valjean lowers Cosette down into the garden, and drops down
     after her.

     Javert and his men enter the dead end to find them gone.


50   INT. CONVENT CLOISTER - NIGHT                              50

     Valjean crouched low, with Cosette in his arms, holding her
     still and quiet until Javert is gone.

     Then he straightens up and looks round. He takes in the
     sound of singing.

                         NUNS

He goes closer to the windows of the building. Through the
blurry glass he can make out a chapel, and a line of nuns
singing.

Valjean continues and sees a man filling in a new grave.
The man starts as he sees Valjean.

                    FAUCHELEVENT
          Who's that?

Valjean jumps, takes Cosette protectively into his arms.
Turns to answer.

                    FAUCHELEVENT
          Why, it's Monsieur Mayor!

It's Fauchelevent, now a gardener, still limping from his
injury.

                    VALJEAN
          Who are you?

          this job as a gardener!

Valjean gazes at him, and remembers.

                     VALJEAN
          Now you can do the same for me.
          We need a place of sanctuary.
          This child and I, we need to
          disappear.

          You are brought to God's domain
          May the sisters grant you shelter
          May their prayers ease your pain.

Valjean and Cosette follow him to the convent.

                    VALJEAN
          We'll give thanks for what is
          granted
          What the sisters may ordain
          Here we pray for new beginnings -
          Here our lives can start again.
                                                           57.


     Valjean looks to the heavens. The camera soars into the air
     and heads east as dawn breaks over Paris. We rush low over
     Paris as the sun comes up, towards the Place de la Bastille.

               Nine years later

     The dawn light glows on a massive ELEPHANT. The monument,
     made of wood and plaster, now ruined and crumbling, stands
     on a plinth on one side of the wide open square. On the far
     side, the remains of the great fortress that was the
     Bastille. In the middle, scaffolding surrounds a half-built
     triumphal column, which is being erected to celebrate the
     new regime.

     SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION:

               Paris, 1832.

     The streets that run from the square lead in one direction
     to the Paris of power and wealth; in the other direction
     into the slums.

     The camera sweeps in and down to meet the elephant.

     A head pops out of one of the elephant's many holes -
     GAVROCHE, a street urchin. He gives a shrill whistle. At
     once a dozen more street urchins show themselves, from
     every crack in the monument's skin. Agile as a monkey,
     Gavroche drops to the ground, followed by his band.

     dodging the crowds of strolling bourgeoisie and beggars,
     weaving in and out of the lines of carriages attempting to
     make their way in either direction. These are the
     conveyances of the rich, fine gilded coaches with matched
     horses and footmen on the back. Virtually at a standstill,
     they lend Gavroche a platform as he leaps from coach to
     coach, a street urchin dancing on the heads of the elite.

     As he goes, the poor on the pavements sing to the stony-
     faced rich in their golden high-sprung glory -

The fine ladies and grand gentlemen in the carriages avert
their eyes, or raise the blinds of their carriage windows
to shut out the sight of the losers of their world.

Gavroche, bounding over their heads, evading the swipes of
liveried footmen, lands on the running board of one            
particularly grand carriage and begs/taunts the RICH

STILL RUNNING WITH Gavroche as he hops onto the back of
another very grand carriage, the traffic now moving at

     The carriage has reached an arch into a courtyard where a         
     crowd of a couple of hundred is gathered outside a house of       
     sickness. The carriage stops as its occupant wants to watch       
     what is going on. The street is padded with straw. Many eyes      
     gaze up at the draped windows. People cross themselves. A         
     priest is seen hurrying into the house, accompanied by two

     A student, ENJOLRAS, stands on a raised step, making an

     Marius turns to see his Grandfather staring him down,                
     furious.

     Through a crack in a door, we see Marius sitting on a tatty          
     mattress in a tiny hovel of a room. He is taking out a               
     hunting rifle from under the mattress, wrapped in a rag. His         
     eye is caught by the ring on his finger.                             

     CLOSE ON a signet ring, a family crest.                              

     Marius stares at the ring then takes it off his finger.

     Marius rushes down the stairs of the slum, Eponine following.

     Eponine comes to a stop, looking wistfully after Marius.

                         EPONINE
               Little he knows -
               Little he sees.


55   EXT. RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE - END OF DAY                       55     

     Marius is stopped as he exits the front door of the Gorbeau         
     Tenement by a passing carriage. Once it passes Marius sees          
     two people in the street outside. One is an old gentleman,          
     Valjean. The other is a beautiful young girl, Cosette. The          
     two are giving alms to beggars as they walk back from               
     evening church service.                                             

     Marius can't take his eyes off Cosette. He's never seen
     anyone so lovely in his life. We hear the instrumental
     foreshadowing of `A Heart Full of Love'.

     As if drawn by Marius's gaze, Cosette looks up and meets
     his eyes. She too is amazed: he's looking at her as if he
     already knows her. A second carriage breaks their held              
     gaze.                                                               

     Marius continues on down the street and when he looks back,         
     at that precise moment Cosette looks at him again.                  

     Valjean instinctively puts his arm round her, guarding her
     jealously from this distant boy's gaze.                             

     We cut further down the street to an alleyway where the             
     Thenardiers, heavily disguised, are waiting for Valjean's           
     approach with their gang of crooks, Babet, Brujon,                  
     Clacquesous, Montparnasse.                                          

                          THENARDIER
               Everyone here, you know your
               place -
               Brujon, Babet, Clacquesous -
               You, Montparnasse, watch for the
               law -

                   (Montparnasse hurries over                            
                     to the doorway where                                
                     Eponine was watching                                
                     Marius)                                             
               You turn on the tears!                                    
                   (to Madame Thenardier who                             
                     is holding a baby)                                  
               No mistakes, my dears!

     Thenardier approaches Valjean and lures him into the mouth          
     of the alleyway where Madame Thenardier is sat on the               
     ground holding the crying infant. Cosette is a few steps            
     behind, still entranced by the sight of Marius.                     
                                                     63.


                    THENARDIER
          Please, M'sieur, come this way.
          Here's a child that ain't eaten
          today.
          Save a life, spare a sou!
          God rewards all the good that you
          do.

As Valjean bends down to look at Madame Thenardier she          
recognizes him.                                                 

                    MADAME THENARDIER                           
          Wait a bit! Know that face!
              (to Monsieur Thenardier)                          
          Ain't the world a remarkable
          place!

                    THENARDIER                                  
          Men like me don't forget -
          You're the bastard who borrowed
          Cosette!

                    VALJEAN
          What is this? Are you mad?
          No, Monsieur, you don't know what
          you say!

Thenardier pulls off his disguise. Valjean recognises him.      

                    THENARDIER
          You know me! I know you!
          And you'll pay what I'm due.

He signals to his gang. A door opens in the alleyway            
revealing the huge Brujon. The gang move in on Valjean          
menacingly.                                                     

                    EPONINE                                     
              (shouts from up the                               
               street)                                          
          It's the police! Disappear!                           
          Run for it! It's Javert!                              

The gang spill out into the street to find themselves           
confronted by Javert now with his men. Marius watches, as       
does Gavroche, drawn by the rumpus.

                    JAVERT
          Another brawl in the square!
          Another stink in the air!
          Was there a witness to this?
          Well, let him speak to Javert!

He sees man with his arm protectively round a girl but does     
not recognize Valjean as Valjean has averted his face.          
                                                       64.


                    JAVERT
          Monsieur, these streets are not
          safe.
          But let these vermin beware,
          We'll see that justice is done!

He turns back on the Thenardier gang in the passage.

                    JAVERT
          Look upon this fine collection
          Crawled from underneath a stone.
          This swarm of worms and maggots
          Could have picked you to the
          bone!
          I know this man over here,
          I know his name and his trade.
          And on your witness, m'sieur,
          I'll see him suitably paid.

He turns back to find Valjean and Cosette gone.                

                    JAVERT
          But where's the gentlemen gone?
          And why on earth did he run?

                    THENARDIER
          You will have a job to find him!
          He's not all he seems to be -
          And that girl he trails behind
          him
          She's the child he stole from me!

Marius, equally baffled, goes off in search of them.

                     JAVERT
          Could it be he's that old
          jailbird
          That the tide now washes in?
          Heard my name and started
          running...
          All the omens point to him.

Thenardier, listening, hears this all with great interest.
So Valjean is a crook like him.

                    JAVERT
          And the girl who stood beside
          him,
          When I turned they both had gone.
          Could he be the man I've hunted?
          Could it be he's Jean Valjean?

                    THENARDIER
          In the absence of a victim,
          Dear Inspector, may I go?
          And remember when you've nicked
          him
          It was me what told you so.
                                                        65.


                    JAVERT
              (to himself)
          Let the old man keep on running
          I will run him off his feet!
              (to the crowd)

              (to Gavroche)                                      
          Clear this garbage off the
          street!

Gavroche is sitting on a horse trough and falls back into it     
when Javert surprises him.                                       

He is furious. He sings to Javert's departing back, and to       
Marius who is close by.                                          

                    GAVROCHE
          That inspector thinks he's
          something
          But it's me who runs this town!
          And my theatre never closes
          And the curtain's never down!
          Trust Gavroche! Have no fear!
          You can always find me here!                           

                    EPONINE
          Cosette! Now I remember...
          Cosette! How can it be?
          We were children together.
          Look what's become of me.

She turns back to find Marius gazing down the street.

                    MARIUS
          Eponine! Who was that girl?

                    EPONINE

        WIDE of the Police Headquarters on the Isle de la Cite: a           
        huge bureaucracy. The camera finds Javert standing inside           
        looking out of a door leading onto the roof. As he sings            
        he walks out onto the roof and stands by the symbol of the          
        HQ, a monumental stone eagle. He looks down at the lights
        reflected in the river below. Then up at the great city.
        Javert too has a God, and this is his prayer.

Valjean walks down the overgrown garden path to the gate.

discovery, and hides behind the wall.

Valjean returns inside.                                         

Cosette has dropped a keepsake through the gate. Marius picks

Marius makes his way back down the street, filled with          
thoughts of his love. Completely forgetting Eponine is there.   

Shadows move up the street from the other direction. It's       
Thenardier and his gang. They gather at the wrought-iron
gate.

     We pull back from Enjolras and Marius holding their flag at         
     the first floor window with the students beyond them to see         
     that citizens have spilled out of the Cafe Musain into the          
     street and have all joined in the final chorus.                     


85   EXT. PARIS STREETS - DAY                                     85

     All is still. Then comes the soft beating of draped drums.
     The tramp of feet.

     All down the streets, waiting, the silent faces of the
     poor. Among them we see Enjolras, Marius, and the radical
     students.
                                                     86.


Police and national guardsmen control the growing crowds.        

Now into view come the leaders of a great FUNERAL
PROCESSION. An entire battalion of infantry, marching with
weapons reversed. A column of black-suited dignitaries
carrying branches of laurel. A division of Cavalry rides in      
front, behind a section of military drummers who drum a          
military tatoo.                                                  

INTO FRAME comes a team of black horses stepping slowly,         
black plumes nodding, drawing behind them a gun carriage         
draped in the tricolour flag. On the carriage stands a           
COFFIN.                                                          

Softly, in time with the drums, the watching people begin        
to sing.

                    CROWD
          Do you hear the people sing
          Singing the song of angry men?
          It is the music of a people
          Who will not be slaves again!

The police and guardsmen look round to see who is singing
so subversively, but they can't be sure where it's coming
from. The singing grows stronger.

                    CROWD
          When the beating of your heart
          Echoes the beating of the drums
          There is a life about to start
          When tomorrow comes!

The dignitaries become aware of the singing, and glance
uneasily from side to side.                                      

                    CROWD

          Beyond the barricade
          Is there a world you long to see?

As the coffin on its carriage draws level with the students,     
Enjolras suddenly steps out in front of the horses drawing       
the carriage and waves the red flag, stopping the horses and     
the procession.

          Then join in the fight
          That will give you the right
          To be free!

The students break the ranks of the crowd and surround the       
coffin carriage.

Enjolras, Marius and Courfeyrac and other students climb       
onto the top of the carriage as the horses and led by          
Combeferre.

          The blood of the martyrs
          Will water the meadows of France!

The crowd supports them and surround the coffin carriage,      
blocking the attempts of the police to intervene, singing
with passion.

          There is a life about to start

Enjolras, the students, and the impassioned crowd have now
become the procession. They turn off the main street away      
from the expected course of the funeral procession.            
Gavroche's elephant looms over this side street. Gavroche      
and his gang jump down from the elephant to join in.           

As the procession turns off, the calvary division gallop       
ahead and disappear round a corner.

          Is there a world you long to see?
          Do you hear the people sing?

                         STUDENTS/CROWD (cont'd)
               Say, do you hear the distant

               It is the future that we bring
               When tomorrow comes!

     The students and crowd come face to face with the calvary. On   
     one side, muskets of the infantry poke through the broken       
     down fence surrounding the elephant. Other infantry have        
     taken up position in a cafe opposite, upending tables to        
     provide cover.                                                  

     There is a tense, prolonged silence. Then suddenly one              
     nervous SOLDIER lets off a round. It hits a middle aged             
     kindly looking WOMAN CITIZEN in the crowd around the coffin         
     carriage. The crowd is furious. Students charge the soldier,        
     grab his musket and knock him down with the hilt of the gun.        

     More shots ring out. The cavalry charges. The funeral               
     explodes into a riot. The people of Paris turn on the
     dragoons, the National Guards, the police. More squadrons
     of dragoons charge into the crowd, sabres unsheathed. Women
     run screaming in terror.

     Some students fire weapons into the air, some into the              
     cavalry and at the infantry. Enjolras knocks a calvary              
     officer off his horse and Marius jumps on the horse.                

     The students break away and race off through the cafe into          
     a side street where citizens begin to erect a barricade. A          
     cavalry rider gives chase and is shot by one of the                 
     students and falls through the window of an upended                 
     carriage. The students, with Marius on horseback, race to           
     the slums.                                                          


86   EXT. RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE/INT. CAFE MUSAIN - DAY             86     

     FOLLOW the students as they burst into their home street.           
     They have been joined by a motley collection of citizens            
     including burghers and an old eccentric man FATHER MABEUF           
     who works as hard as anyone. They raid a fencing shop and a         
     gun shop for weapons, they force wives to give up their             
     husbands' muskets and chalk up the debt to the revolution           
     on their front doors, they encourage homeowners to                  
     contribute furniture sometimes appearing at high windows to         
     help overcome any reluctance. Soon the street is raining            
     tables, chairs, mattresses, sofas. They smash streetlamps.          
     They set to work to build their barricade. Students                 
     commandeer an omnibus which is overturned to form the               
     barricade's heart. Three students arrive in the street              
     hauling an uprooted tree.                                           
                                                     89.


They pull up paving stones, rip boards, timbers and front       
doors from house and shop-fronts, pull down buttresses, and     
raid the Cafe Musain, systematically stripping it of every      
item of furniture despite the lamentations and                  
protestations of Madame Hucheloup and her barmaid.              

As the barricade rises they bring down from the first floor     
of the cafe the rifles and ammunition they've gathered, to      
prepare to defend their chosen ground. A student stands on      
a stone post distributing weapons. They line the first and      
second floor front rooms with paving stones to create           
protected shooting positions. The inside of the barricade       
is built neatly with steps up made from paving stones. The      
outside is a crazy knarled mess.                                

                    ENJOLRAS
          Here upon these stones
          We will build our barricade.
          In the heart of the city
          We claim as our own
          Each man to his duty
          And don't be afraid.

A man in worker's clothing is helping build the growing         
barricade,. He wears the insignia of the rebels, and keeps      
his head down.

                    ENJOLRAS
          Wait!
          I will need a report
          On the strength of the foe.

The man who's just arrived looks up. It's Javert.

                    JAVERT
          I can find out the truth!
          I know their ways,
          Fought their wars,
          Served my time

He slips away through the barricade, which is still rising.

      The barricade is now complete: an impressive wall up to            
      twelve feet high, with one heavily guarded section that can        
      be wheeled open to allow access. Two smaller barricades            
      protect the left and right side of the cafe. Enjolras              
      climbs halfway up the main barricade and turns to his              
      little army. Grantaire prises the final piece of Madame            
      Hucheloup's furniture from her arms - her favourite sewing         
      armchair - and adds it to the barricade. As the men sing           
      she steals it back defiantly.

      It is night. The students have been waiting for hours.

      A single flaming torch atop the barricade caged in by cobbles
      underlights a fluttering red flag.

      There is no sign yet of any opposition.

      A boy climbs down from sentry duty on the barricade. Marius

          I have counted each man.
          I will tell what I can.
          Better be warned
          They have armies to spare
          And our danger is real -
          We will need all our cunning
          To bring them to heel.

                    ENJOLRAS
          Have faith!
          If you know what their movements
          are
          We'll spoil their game.
          There are ways that a people can
          fight -
          We shall overcome their power!

                    JAVERT
          I have overheard their plans.
          There will be no attack tonight.
          They intend to starve you out
          Before they start a proper fight -
          Concentrate their force,
          Hit us when it's light -

                       GAVROCHE
          Liar!

They all look up. There's Gavroche, on the top of the
barricade.

                    GAVROCHE
          Good evening, dear Inspector.
          Lovely evening, my dear!
          I know this man, my friends.
          His name's Inspector Javert!
          So don't believe a word he says
          Cause none of it's true.
          This only goes to show
          What little people can do.                            

Guns swing round to aim at Javert. He stares back in
defiance.

Gavroche comes dancing down the barricade to Courfeyrac's       
delighted embrace.
                                                        92.


                     COURFEYRAC
           Bravo, little Gavroche!
           You're the top of the class!

Gavroche grabs Grantaire's red cap and puts it on his own
head, mimicking the students.

                     PROUVAIRE
           So what are we going to do
           With this snake in the grass?


Enjolras faces Javert.

                     ENJOLRAS
           Tie this man and take him
           To the tavern in there!
           The people will decide your fate,
           Inspector Javert!

                     JAVERT
           Shoot me now or shoot me later -
           Every schoolboy to his sport!
           Death to each and every traitor!
           I renounce your people's court!

                     ENJOLRAS
           Take this man. Bring him through.
           There is work we have to do.

Javert is led into the cafe. As they pass through the front       
door only one student is holding Javert. Seizing his              
opportunity, Javert breaks free and the students have to          
subdue him by force. Javert is on his knees and is being tied     
to the staircase.                                                 

                     ENJOLRAS                                     
           When are they coming!?                                 

Silence.                                                          

Suddenly, out of the darkness, the students and citizens at
the barricade here an ominous distant sound. The sound of
marching feet, hundreds of men, marching in unison. First
soft, then building louder and louder, closer and closer.
Boots on cobbles. The sound comes right into the end of the
street.

Enjolras and all the students man the main barricade.             

Silence.

They peer over the barricade. In the pitch blackness, all
they can make out is hundreds of gossamer thin slivers. These
are bayonets and musket barrels dimly lit by the reflection
from the torch.

A voice shouts out from the darkness.
                                                     93.


                    ARMY OFFICER
          Who's there?

At the same time we hear the clatter of guns being levelled.

                    ENJOLRAS
          French Revolution.

                    ARMY OFFICER
          Fire!

A flash turns all the facades of the street bright crimson as
though the door of a furnace has suddenly open and shut.

A dreadful explosion bursts over the barricade. The red flag
falls, the pole sliced through. Bullets richochet off the
cornices of the houses, bore into the barricade and wound
several men.

                    ENJOLRAS
              (as students return fire)                           
          Comrades, do not fire back! Do not                      
          waste powder!                                           

In the darkness, the clang of ramrods in muskets - the troop      
reloading weapons.                                                

Enjolras picks up the fallen flag and is about to take it up      
when the old man Father Mabeuf who has seen many                  
insurrections before this takes the flag and runs up onto the     
top of the barricade.                                             

                    ARMY OFFICER
          Who's there? Get down!

                    MABEUF                                        
          Vive la France!

                    ARMY OFFICER
          Fire!

A second volley.

Father Mabeuf falls down dead. While everyone is reacting to   
the dead old man and the wounded, the men are distracted from   
noticing that some French soldiers have used the cover of
darkness to creep down the street.

All at once the FIRST FULL ATTACK begins. Shouts and the
rattle of gunfire as SOLDIERS throw themselves up and over
the barricade. The students run for their guns and return
fire. They are taken by surprise. All could be lost in the
first instant. Some soldiers make it up to the top of the
barricade, where they're driven back by the fierce
resistance of the defenders. Eponine sees one soldier
aiming his rifle at Marius - she throws herself in front of
Marius just as the rifle fires - and Marius is safe.
                                                       94.


They are being   overrun. Panic ensues. The gun battle is
fierce. Marius   in a flash of inspiration realises all is lost   
unless they do   something. He drags a barrel of gunpowder to
the top of the   barricade, grabs the torch and with a face of
deadly resolve   he tips the torch towards the barrel.

                     MARIUS
          Clear out or I'll blow up the
          barricade!

Everyone freezes.

                    ARMY OFFICER
          Blow it up then and take yourself
          with it!

                    MARIUS
          And myself with it!

Marius brings the torch closer to the powder keg.

But already the soldiers have cleared out.

Marius comes down from the barricade.

As everyone surrounds Marius in amazement he spots Eponine
lying propped against the barricade.

                    MARIUS
          Eponine! What have you done?

He kneels by her side. Eponine is dying.

                    EPONINE
          Here... It's from Cosette...
          I kept it from you...

With a struggle she pulls the letter out of her pocket, and
pushes it into his hand.

                    EPONINE
          Don't be too hard on me...

Marius is shocked to find blood pouring from her wound.

                    MARIUS
          Eponine, you're hurt!
          You need some help!

Rain begins to fall.
                                               95.

          words of love -

     Marius reads the letter Eponine has given him. He takes out
     pencil and paper and writes a note. Looking round, he sees
     Gavroche.

     landlady indicates the door, and Gavroche knocks boldly.
     The door opens a crack to reveal a cautious Valjean.

                         GAVROCHE
               Letter for Cosette.

     Gavroche holds out the letter with one hand, not quite
     giving it, the other hand open for a tip.

     Valjean gives him a coin, which he pockets as he hands over
     the letter.

                         VALJEAN
               `Dearest Cosette, you have
               entered my soul

     He looks up, deeply distressed. He can't bear the thought
     of losing Cosette.

     Valjean walks the streets, not caring where he goes,
     struggling with his tormented thoughts. He sees a barricade
     being dismantled. And bodies.

     Suddenly he knows what he's going to do. He sees a dead
     soldier. He takes his jacket and swiftly pulls it on.

     He continues on his way in the dark.

     Looking up he sees that he's been walking all the time
     towards the very barricade where Marius waits.

     Now looking like a soldier, he passes unchallenged through
     their lines, and into the shadows.

     As he passes, he notices two soldiers climbing up onto the          
     rooftops.

     Glimpses through the barricade of a lone figure approaching
     from the far end of the narrow street.

     The figure comes into lamp light. It's Valjean, in the
     soldier's jacket. The student sentries level their guns.
     Gavroche jumps up.

                         VALJEAN
               I come here as a volunteer.

                         JOLY
               Approach and show your face!

                         PROUVAIRE
               You wear an army uniform.

                         VALJEAN
               That's why they let me through.

     The student sentries open the slot in the barricade to let
     Valjean enter.

                         JOLY
               You've got some years behind you,
               sir.

                         VALJEAN
               There's much that I can do.
                                                     99.


                    JOLY
          You see that prisoner over there?

He points to Javert, in a dark corner, his hands tied.

                    GRANTAIRE
          A volunteer like you!

                    COMBEFERRE
          A spy who calls himself Javert!

                    GRANTAIRE
          He's going to get it too!                              

Javert looks up and meets Valjean's eyes. A steady shared
look.

                    GAVROCHE                                     
          Don't shoot! I know him! He's no                       
          soldier!                                               

Suddenly Valjean spots a couple of snipers creeping over the     
roofs to gain an angle of attack on them. They are aiming at
Enjolras. Swiftly Valjean grabs a gun and shoots up at them      
sending them scattering. Quickly other students join in and
the snipers are driven back.

There is a burst of gunfire from both ends of the street as a   
brief fire fight ensues.                                        

The snipers have disappeared.                                    

Enjolras turns to Valjean.                                       

                    ENJOLRAS
          For your presence of mind,
          For the deed you have done,
          I will thank you, M'sieur,
          When our battle is won.

                    MARIUS
          Thank you, M'sieur.

                    VALJEAN
          Give me no thanks, M'sieur.
          There's something you can do.

                    ENJOLRAS
          If it is in my power.

                    VALJEAN
          Give me the spy Javert!
          Let me take care of him.

Javert hears this with grim satisfaction.
                                                    100.


                    JAVERT
          The law is inside out.
          The world is upside down.

                    ENJOLRAS
          Do what you have to do -
          The man belongs to you.

He turns to his little army.

                     ENJOLRAS
          The enemy may be regrouping!
          Hold yourselves in readiness!
          Come, my friends, back to your
          positions!
          The dawn is breaking fast.

Valjean takes Javert out the back of the Cafe Musain. He     
carries a knife.                                             

                    VALJEAN
          We meet again...

                    JAVERT
          You've hungered for this all your
          life.
          Take your revenge.
          How right you should kill with a
          knife.

Valjean uses the knife to cut Javert free.

                    VALJEAN
          You talk too much.
          Your life is safe in my hands.

                    JAVERT
          Don't understand...

                    VALJEAN
          Get out of here.

                    JAVERT
          Valjean, take care!
          I'm warning you.

                    VALJEAN
          Clear out of here!

                    JAVERT
          Once a thief, forever a thief.
          What you want, you always steal.
          You would trade your life for
          mine.
          Yes, Valjean, you want a deal!
          Shoot me now for all I care -
          If you let me go, beware!
          You'll still answer to Javert!
                                                    101.


                    VALJEAN
          You are wrong, and always have
          been wrong.
          I'm a man no worse than any man.
          You are free, and there are no
          conditions -
          No bargains or petitions.
          There's nothing that I blame you
          for.
          You've done your duty, nothing
          more.
          No doubt our paths will cross
          again.

He raises his gun and points it at Javert.

                    VALJEAN
          Go!

As Javert goes, he raises the gun barrel and fires a single
shot into the air.                                              

                    ENJOLRAS
          Courfeyrac, you take the watch -
          They may attack before it's
          light.
          Everybody keep the faith,
          For certain as our banner flies,
          We are not alone -
          The people too must rise!

Marius is manically working to raise the height of one of the   
smaller barricades.

     Grantaire glares at Enjolras and enters the cafe.

     Valjean is moving through the cafe when he hears Marius         
     through a window. He moves to the window. Marius sits beneath   
     it.

     Valjean listens to Marius's song, and he's moved.

     Look-outs keep watch at either end of the barricaded
     street. Many of the rest of the rebels are sleeping.                 

     Valjean paces, unable to sleep, inside the cafe. Dead                
     bodies are lined up on the ground floor. He comes to a               
     stop, and gazes on Marius as he sleeps through the window.

     CRANE UP AND UP - Seeing the little world of the barricaded
     street now surrounded by waiting soldiers - and the streets
     round them packed with soldiers in their thousands, so many
     that we know the little band can never win.

     CRANE UP AND UP until the barricade and the army that
     entraps it has become a small pool of darkness in the

     He has been on a reconnaissance. He looks at the street. No

     crack - a face peeps - and it closes again. Below him the
     students are up and getting ready.

          Come back, Gavroche! Don't you
          dare!

                    JOLY
          Someone pull him down right now!

                    GAVROCHE
          Look at me, I'm almost there!

                    GAVROCHE
          Little people know
          When little people fight
          We may look easy pickings
          But we've got some bite!
          So never kick a dog
          When he's just a pup -
          We'll fight like twenty armies
          And we won't give up!

The rays of the rising sun break through, lighting up
Gavroche.

                    GAVROCHE
          So you'd better run for cover
          When the pup grows -

Crack! A musket shot. Gavroche falls face down onto the
barricade.

                    COURFEYRAC
          No-o!

He runs up the barricade, seizes Gavroche's body in his
arms, convulsed with grief, and brings it back through the
gate in the barricade.

At the other end of the street Javert has appeared. He sees
this gate. And talks to the Army Officer.

As the smoke from the muskets clears horses are revealed
drawing field artillery into position. The Army Officer is
lining up the big guns carefully.
                                                      106.


                    ARMY OFFICER
          You at the barricades listen to
          this!
          The people of Paris sleep in
          their beds!
          You have no chance,
          No chance at all!
          Why throw your lives away?

Enjolras gazes on his pitifully small group.

                    ENJOLRAS
          Let us die facing our foes!
          Make them bleed while we can!

                    COMBEFERRE
          Make'em pay through the nose!

                    COURFEYRAC
          Make'em pay for every man!

                    ENJOLRAS
          Let others rise to take our place
          Until the earth is free!

The sun now appears above the rooftops of the city.

And the big guns fire - BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

The bombardment hits the barricade, rocking it. In its wake     
a massive barrage of musket fire.

The big gun has been lined up with the gate and has burst
right through in the first hit.

Bullets fly, and every few moments another cannon ball
smashes into the piled debris. Javert is glimpsed among the
attackers.

Enjolras and the students throw themselves onto the
barricades, firing at the attackers, handing their rifles
down to others to be re-loaded, firing again.

Valjean moves among them, tending to the wounded, lifting
down the dead, regardless of his own safety.

Marius takes a bullet, and crumples and falls. Valjean runs
towards him -

CRASH! The latest cannonade bursts a hole in the barricade
and now the soldiers are storming through. The hard core of
student fighters retreat, firing as they go, into the Café
Musain.
                                                          107.


97    INT. CAFÉ MUSAIN - DAY                                       97

      Students and soldiers fight in the café, on the stairs, up
      the stairs to the upper room. Students driving back the
      pursuing soldiers hack away at the staircase, smashing it
      to fragments - the soldiers below fire up at them -
      students fall, their bodies caught on the jagged remnants
      of the stairs. Grantaire is still unconscious from drink.


98    EXT. BARRICADE - DAY                                         98

      Valjean has Marius in his arms and is hiding him from the
      onrush of the soldiers -


99    INT. CAFÉ MUSAIN - DAY                                       99

      The students' ammunition has run out, they're hurling
      sticks and bottles - but the soldiers have found a way to
      clamber up, shooting as they come, and one by one the
      students are falling.


100   EXT. STREET OUTSIDE CAFÉ MUSAIN - DAY                       100

      Valjean carries Marius away from the carnage. A soldier
      challenges him. One violent blow from Valjean sends the
      soldier flying -


101   INT. CAFÉ MUSAIN - DAY                                      101

      The soldiers break through at last to the upper room, to find
      there's only Enjolras still alive. He stands by the window,
      knowing he will die now, proud and unafraid. Seeing him the
      soldiers hesitate. The sudden silence wakes Grantaire from
      his drunken slumber.

                          GRANTAIRE
                Long live the republic!

      He sees Enjolras with the muskets raised against him.
      Grantaire goes and joins him. Enjolras smiles, and raises his
      now-ragged red flag.

      The rifles blaze. Grantaire drops back to the ground.
      Enjolras falls back -


102   EXT. BARRICADE - DAY                                        102

      Enjolras falling backwards out of the window, until he
      hangs upside down, the red flag still in his hands,
      streaming like blood down the wall.
                                                          108.


      PULL BACK to see the street littered with corpses, and the
      remains of the barricade, and soldiers scouring the rubble
      for any last pockets of resistance.

      BACK AND BACK to come to a stop looking at the wide scene.
      INTO FRAME walks Javert, grimly surveying the victory of
      law over rebellion.


103   EXT. BACK ALLEY - DAY                                       103

      Valjean carries Marius down a long narrow alley that runs
      between the backs of tall houses. The alley turns a corner -
      and there ahead is a dead end. Behind him, the stamp of
      soldiers' boots. Ahead, no way out.

      Then his searching gaze falls on an iron grating in the
      ground. A storm drain.

      ON THE SOLDIERS - As they come round the corner into the
      end of the alley. They look round. It's empty.

                          SOLDIER
                Nothing here!

      The soldiers depart. A moment of silence.

      Then into the alley's end steps Javert. Not so easily
      fooled. He walks all the way to the end, and looks round.
      He sees the drain at his feet. He sees the signs that the
      grating has been lifted.

      He stoops, and tries to lift it. It's far too heavy for
      him.

      He straightens up and looks round, calculating. Where does
      the drain lead?


104   INT. PARIS SEWERS - DAY                                     104

      Valjean is pulling Marius after him down a tight sloping
      pipe, where dark water races. Suddenly they start to slide,
      then drop through a vent into a wide sewage tunnel. Faint
      light reflecting off the slime of curving tunnel walls. The
      skitter of rats. Sodden forms floating by: dead bodies.

      Valjean carries Marius down the tunnel, moving as fast as
      he can, losing strength all the time. He reaches an
      intersection where four sewers meet. Light falls through
      distant gratings. One of the four sewers is dry. Here he
      lets his burden down, and himself sinks to the slimy ground
      to rest. He lets his eyes close.

      A voice echoes in the shadows.
                                                    109.


                    THENARDIER
          Here's a hint of gold
          Stuck into a tooth -
          Pardon me, m'sieur,
          You won't be needing it no more.
          Shouldn't be too hard to sell.

A figure coming closer. A sewer thief, robbing corpses. No
sign of life in either Valjean or Marius.

                    THENARDIER
          Well, someone's got to clean'em
          up, my friends,
          Before the little harvest
          Disappears into the mud.
          Someone's got to collect their
          odds and ends
          When the gutters run with blood.

Now we see the thief is Thenardier. He finds a ring on
Marius's finger and pulls it off.

                    THENARDIER
          Here's a tasty ring
          Pretty little thing
          Heart's no longer going
          And he's lived his little time,
          But his watch is ticking yet.

          It's a world where the dog eats
          the dog.
          Where they kill for the bones in
          the street.
          And God in his heaven,
          He don't interfere
          Cos he's dead as the stiff at my
          feet!
          I raise my eyes to see the
          heavens
          And only the moon looks down.
          The harvest moon shines down!

Valjean wakes, rears up, seizes Thenardier by the arm,
slams him against the sewer wall.

                    VALJEAN
          How do I get out of here?

                    THENARDIER
          There! That way!

Valjean drops him, picks Marius up once more, and sets off.

Thenardier stares after them, grinning. He's sent then the
wrong way.

LATER - Valjean in the sewers, Marius on his back, and
they're sinking ever deeper into the slimy water.
                                                             110.


      As he feels himself sink, Valjean holds Marius up in his
      arms and forges on, chest deep, lifting the younger man
      above his head. Still he sinks, until his face is half-
      submerged and he's gagging in the filth. He stumbles, and
      suddenly he's sunk beneath the surface, and Marius is
      dropping -

      Then up he bursts again, face black with slime, eyes
      burning with his refusal to be beaten.

      LATER - Valjean staggers down the endless sewers, Marius on
      his back. But all the time he can hear, closer now, the
      rushing sound of the river.

      Round a bend and at last - moonlight ahead.                           

      He drags himself on through the shallow running water
      towards the moonlight.                                                

      He reaches the exit at last. Before him the river.


105   EXT. RIVER EMBANKMENT, PARIS - NIGHT                          105     

      Valjean, crusted with slime, heaves Marius out of the sewer
      onto the embankment that runs beside the river.

      He looks up. There, staring at him, is Javert.

      Valjean rises slowly. Heaves Marius up onto his back once
      more. The strain of the night is showing. He's a man near
      the end of his strength.

                           VALJEAN
                It's you, Javert!
                I knew you wouldn't wait too
                long.
                The faithful servant at his post
                once more.
                This man's done no wrong.
                And he needs his family's care.

                          JAVERT
                I warned you I would not give in!
                I won't be swayed!

                          VALJEAN
                Another hour yet
                And then I'm yours
                And all our debts are paid.

                          JAVERT
                The man of mercy comes again
                And talks of justice!
                                                    111.


                    VALJEAN
          Come, time is running short -
          Look down, Javert!
          He's standing in his grave!

He starts to move past Javert.

Javert draws his pistol and holds it to Valjean's head.

                    JAVERT
          One more step and you die.

Valjean meets his eyes. That old battle of will against
will.

                    VALJEAN
          Then I die.

He starts walking past Javert. Javert's hand trembles as it
holds the pistol.

Valjean keeps walking. Javert wills himself to shoot, but
he just can't do it. Frustrated, enraged with himself, he
lowers the gun.

                    JAVERT
          Take him, Valjean,
          Before I change my mind!
          I will be waiting...
          24601!

He turns away, trembling now all up and down his body. He
stares into the river. Valjean is gone now. He's alone.

                    JAVERT
          Who is this man?
          What sort of devil is he?
          To have caught me in a trap
          And choose to let me go free?
          It was his hour at last
          To put a seal on my fate
          Wipe out the past
          And wash me clean off the slate!
          All it would take
          Was a flick of his knife
          Vengeance was his
          And he gave me back my life!

He begins to move away along the embankment, up steps,
towards a bridge. He's unaware of everything except the
turmoil in his brain.

                     JAVERT
          Damned if I live in the debt of a
          thief!
          Damned if I yield at the end of
          the chase!
                     (more)
                                                    112.

                    JAVERT (cont'd)
          I am the law and the law is not
          mocked!
          I'll spit his pity right back in
          his face!
          There is nothing on earth that we
          share!
          It is either Valjean or Javert!
          How can I allow this man
          To hold dominion over me?
          This desperate man that I have
          hunted...
          He gave me my life! He gave me
          freedom!

          I should have perished by his
          hand
          It was his right...
          It was my right to die as well...
          Instead I live... But live in
          hell!

He moves up from the embankment onto the bridge. Here he
stands, looking down at the dark water of the night river.
The Seine forms a whirlpool here, where violent currents
swirl round the piles of the bridge.

                    JAVERT
          And my thoughts fly apart
          Can this man be believed?
          Shall his sins be forgiven?
          Shall his crimes be reprieved?

          And must I now begin to doubt
          Who never doubted all those
          years?
          My heart is stone and still it
          trembles...
          The world I have known is lost in
          shadow
          Is he from heaven or from hell?
          And does he know
          That granting me my life today
          This man has killed me even so?

He climbs up onto the parapet, reaching his arms up to the
night sky.

                    JAVERT
          I am reaching but I fall
          And the stars are black and cold
          As I stare into the void
          Of a world that cannot hold...

          I'll escape now from that world
          From the world of Jean Valjean
          This is nowhere I can turn...
          There is no way to go on...
                                                             113.


      He reaches higher, turning his body, twisting, as if he
      wants some angel from on high to save him - and so,
      turning, he falls into the river. The swirling eddies close
      over him. And he's lost.


106   EXT. STREET OUTSIDE CAFÉ MUSAIN - DAY                         106

      Soldiers are dismantling the last of the barricade. Women
      move about the street, seeking their dead loved ones among
      the bodies that still litter the barricade. These are both
      the middle-class mothers of the students - Enjolras's
      mother, Grantaire's sister - and the working women of the
      slums for whom they died, united now in their grief.

                          WOMAN 1
                Did you see them
                Going off to fight?

                          WOMAN 2
                Children of the barricade
                Who didn't last the night.

                          WOMAN 3
                Did you see them
                Lying where they died?
                Someone used to cradle them
                And kiss them when they cried.

                          WOMAN 4
                Did you see them lying side by
                side?

                          WOMAN 5
                Who will wake them?

                          WOMAN 6
                No one ever will.

                          WOMAN 2
                No one ever told them that
                A summer day can kill.

                          WOMAN 7
                They were schoolboys
                Never held a gun

      CLOSE ON MARIUS - He's waking from the nightmare, finding
      himself in a fine bed, with clean linen. He looks round: a
      handsome room.

                          GILLENORMAND
                Marius! You've come back to us!

      Marius recognises the old man anxiously watching him: his
      grandfather, Monsieur GILLENORMAND.

                          MARIUS
                Grandfather...

      He struggles to rise, but he lacks the strength. His
      grandfather's face shows only love and concern.

                          GILLENORMAND
                Rest, Marius. No more harsh words
                between us. I just thank God
                you're alive.

      Timidly the old man comes closer to the bed. Tears form in
      Marius's eyes. Encouraged, the old man takes Marius's hand
      in his.

                          GILLENORMAND
                You've come home. To all of us.

      Marius makes his way slowly up the stairs to the upper
      room. He's still weak from his wounds. He enters the room
      where his friends died, and looks round. He sinks into a
      chair.

                          MARIUS
                There's a grief that can't be
                spoken
                There's a pain goes on and on
                Empty chairs at empty tables
                Now my friends are dead and gone.

      He sees the bloodstain on the wall beneath the window sill.
      The blood of Enjolras.

                          MARIUS
                Here they talked of revolution
                Here it was they lit the flame
                Here they sang about tomorrow

                          MARIUS (cont'd)
                And tomorrow never came...

                From the table in the corner
                They could see a world reborn
                And they rose with voices ringing
                And I can hear them now!
                The very words that they had sung
                Became their last communion
                On the lonely barricade at dawn.

      He looks out of the window at what's left of the barricade.
      He seems to see again the brave doomed defence, the smoke
      and the gunfire, the young men falling.

                           MARIUS
                Oh my friends, my friends,
                forgive me
                That I live and you are gone
                There's a grief that can't be
                spoken
                There's a pain goes on and on...

                Phantom faces at the window
                Phantom shadows on the floor
                Empty chairs at empty tables
                Where my friends will meet no
                more.

                Oh my friends, my friends, don't
                ask me
                What your sacrifice was for
                Empty chairs at empty tables
                Where my friends will sing no
                more.

      Slowly he rises from the chair and turns to the doorway.
      There stands Cosette, waiting for him.

      Cosette leads him into the room where Valjean and
      Gillenormand wait.

      Marius stands before Valjean, alone in this more private
      room.

          M'sieur, this is a day

          For giving me Cosette?
          Your home shall be with us
          And not a day shall pass
          But we will prove our love
          To you, whom we shall call
          A father to us both,
          A father to us all.

                     VALJEAN
          Not another word, my son.
          There's something now that must
          be done...

He's prepared himself to make this confession, but it's
still hard.

                    VALJEAN
          There lived a man whose name was
          Jean Valjean.
          He stole some bread to save his
          sister's son
          For nineteen winters served his
          time
          In sweat he washed away his
          crime.

Marius hears this with shock.

                     VALJEAN
          Years ago,
          He broke parole and lived a life
          apart...
          How could he tell Cosette and
          break her heart?
          It's for Cosette this must be
          faced:
          If he is caught, she is
          disgraced...
          The time has come to journey on,
          And from this day he must be
          gone!
          Who am I?
          Who am I?

                    MARIUS
          You're Jean Valjean!

Marius can't conceal that he's disturbed by this
revelation.
                                                             118.

                Monsieur, you cannot leave!
                Whatever I tell my beloved
                Cosette
                She will never believe me.

                          VALJEAN
                Make her believe
                I have gone on a journey
                A long way away.
                Tell her my heart was too full
                for farewells -
                It is better this way.
                Promise me, Monsieur, Cosette
                will never know...

                          MARIUS
                I give my word.

                          VALJEAN
                ...What I have spoken, why I must
                go.

                          MARIUS

         As the dance proceeds, two extraordinary figures enter, and

  He takes out money and reluctantly presses it into

  Thenardier has safely pocketed it.

  Valjean is. They hurry away.                                    

  Thenardier clambers to his feet, helped by his wife. He         
  gestures to the band to continue. They stand by the tiered      
  wedding cake. As Thenardier recovers his composure, Madame      
  Thenardier steals one then two pillars from the cake so it      
  collapses on the floor. She then pushes it under the table      
  with her foot.

  As he pivots Madame Thenardier, stolen silver drops out from     
  Madame Thenardier's dress. The music stops dead in the           
  clatter. The Thenardiers look up, as if implying that the        
  silver dropped from the ceiling. The dance continues.

          It's the story
          Of one who turned from hating
          A man who only learned to love
          When you were in his keeping.

Cosette takes the letter and kisses it.

                    COSETTE
          I know it, papa.

Valjean turns back, face shining, towards the table where
the candles burn in the silver candlesticks. There he sees
three ghosts waiting for him. The ghost of the Bishop. The
ghost of Fantine. And beyond her, watching Marius with
love, the ghost of Eponine.

Fantine comes towards him, reaching out her hands.

                    VALJEAN
          I'm ready now, Fantine.

                    FANTINE
          Come with me
          Where chains will never bind you
          All your grief
          At last, at last behind you
          Lord in heaven
          Look down on him in mercy -

                    VALJEAN
          Forgive me all my trespasses
          And take me to your glory!
                                                           125.


      Cosette embraces Valjean, weeping.

      Valjean reaches up his hands, and lets the ghost of Fantine
      take them.

                          FANTINE/EPONINE
                Take my hand
                I'll lead you to salvation
                Take my love
                For love is everlasting...

                          VALJEAN/FANTINE/EPONINE/BISHOP
                And remember
                The truth that once was spoken:
                To love another person
                Is to see the face of God...

      Led by Fantine, Valjean walks out of the Chapel towards the
      cloister.

      What remains is Cosette, her head cradled in the lap of the
      man who has just died.

      The walls of the cloisters are covered in votive candles.
      The Bishop of Digne waits in front of the candles. Now
      Valjean's strong and young again. Before they reach the
      wall of candles, all three are gone.

      As they disappear we CRANE UP, high over the cloister, high
      over the walls of the Convent and we see the Paris streets
      outside. Fires are burning and debris is scattered in the
      streets. Dawn is breaking.

      From far away, the sound of an approaching crowd -


117   EXT. PLACE DE LA BASTILLE - DAY                             117

      THE CAMERA MOVES over the cobbles as the light of the
      rising sun reveals the devastation left by a bitter street
      battle. Past the remains of a barricade.

      The distant sound of an approaching march.

      SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION:

                Sixteen years later
                Paris, 1848.

      From far off, the swelling sounds of the approaching march
      become the words of a song.

                          MARCHERS
                Do you hear the people sing
                Lost in the valley of the night?
                It is the music of a people
                Who are climbing to the light
                For the wretched of the earth
                          (more)
                                                    126.

                    MARCHERS (cont'd)
          There is a flame that never dies
          Even the darkest night will end
          And the sun will rise.

As THE CAMERA RISES we see we're in the Place de la
Bastille. The triumphal column has long been completed, but
the great elephant is sadly dilapidated and has become
incorporated into an immense barricade - three stories
high, seven hundred feet long. Down all the streets that
converge on the square we now see the multiple victory
marches approaching. They cheer and beat drums as they
climb up to the top of the barricade.

SUPERIMPOSE CAPTIONS:

          The people of Paris have risen in
          their tens of thousands.

          The King has fled. A new Republic
          is born.

There in the forefront of one column march Marius and
Cosette.

                    MARCHERS
          They will live again in freedom
          In the garden of the Lord
          They will walk behind the plough-
          share
          They will put away the sword
          The chain will be broken
          And all men will have their
          reward!

As the marchers come nearer we begin to realise how many
there are: thousand upon thousand. And there marching among
them we see ghosts from the past - Enjolras and the
students who died - and Fantine - and Eponine -

And out of the crumbling elephant peers another ghost: the
grinning face of Gavroche. He climbs out to dance on the
elephant, as the crowd fill the square.

                    MARCHERS
          Will you join in our crusade?
          Who will be strong and stand with
          me?
          Somewhere beyond the barricade
          Is there a world you long to see?

As the marchers converge, there watching them are
Thenardier and his wife. Thenardier gives the marchers a
wave of greeting. Survivors to the last.

                    MARCHERS
          Do you hear the people sing?
          Say, do you hear the distant
          drums?
                    (more)
                                                    127.

                    MARCHERS (cont'd)
          It is the future that they bring
          When tomorrow comes!

Now among the marchers we see the ghost of Valjean, singing
with the rest atop the barricade, amongst the waving red
flags.

                    MARCHERS
          Will you join in our crusade?
          Who will be strong and stand with
          me?
          Somewhere beyond the barricade
          Is there a world you long to see?
          Do you hear the people sing?
          Say, do you hear the distant
          drums?
          It is the future that they bring
          When tomorrow comes...
          Tomorrow comes!
