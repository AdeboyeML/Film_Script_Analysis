          An '89 Mustang bursts like a shot over a rise in the highway.
          It's got a rusted two-tone paint job, Maryland plates, and
          bald tires that scream as it peels off an exit and into the

          Will sits on the darkened front stoop. He tosses an empty
          can into the bushes and gets to work on his fourth beer.
          He looks over at a parked Hyundai Elantra. A YOUNG MAN sits
          in the passenger seat with a pensive look on his face. He
          makes a sudden, surprised gasp. The homely YOUNG WOMAN who
          was just blowing him sits up from his lap and rearranges
          herself in the driver seat. She leans over for a goodbye
          kiss. The Young Man obliges with much fanfare.

          Will shakes his head, turns and walks off.
          INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - DAY
          Will wakes up, legs dangling over the edge of a tiny couch.
          His TV is still on, displaying the menu screen from a porn.
          Will looks down at his coffee table. Clears some magazines
          to reveal a file folder. Flips the cover -
          It's full of college applications, drafts of admissions essays,
          a junior college transcript. Will thumbs through one of the
          glossy applications. The kids look young. Very young.
          Will glances over at a picture on his wall: he and Chet at
          high school graduation, looking just as young. They have
          their arms around a pretty girl squeezed between them. Will
          and the girl look very high and very happy.
          Will shuts the folder, slides it back under the coffee table
          debris. He looks over at a clock: it is already 2:00 PM.

          the rear-view mirror.

           Hey, Teddy Ruxpin...what's that?
           You don't have the money? It was
           too tough to rob the bank, so you
           just went back to your bear cave and
           cried like a bitch? Well, guess
           what my stuffed friend...time is up.
                         
          Jay pushes a button on a detonator. Teddy Ruxpin explodes.
          All that remains is a cloud of stuffing.
                         
          Will is frozen in fear.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I liked that bear. I don't even
           know you.
                         
          Dwayne throws Will his car keys.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Go on. Get outta here.
                         
                          WILL
           Guys, can we please just talk about
           this?
           32.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Yeah, of course we can.
                         
          Dwayne pulls out the gun and fires two shots at Will's feet.
          Jay jumps backward, as does Will, who hits the hood of his
          car, slides across it and onto the ground by the driver side.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Be careful!
                         
          Will awkwardly gets to his feet and arranges himself in the
          car, adjusting to the weight of the bomb. As he starts the
          engine and backs away -
                         
                          DWAYNE
           That's right! Get the fuck out of
           here! You're wasting time!
                         
          Once the car is gone, Jay yanks off his gorilla mask. Dwayne
          stays primate.
                         
                          JAY
           What the hell, Dwayne? You told me
           that was a replica gun.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           It was. Then I paid a Mexican 50
           bucks to put a firing pin in it.
           Now it goes boom.
                         
                          JAY
           We didn't discuss a loaded gun!
           Especially not with the bomb around!
                         
          Dwayne gets right in Jay's face. The plastic eyes of his
          mask betray no emotion.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Don't you ever question me. I'm
           fucking this bitch. You're just
           holding the camera.

           Sure, Dwayne...whatever you say.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Good. 'Cause this ain't the Marines.
           This is cash money. You hesitate, you
           fuck up...and I will leave you behind.
                         
          A tense beat. Dwayne pulls his mask off. He looks oddly calm.

          Will's car flies down the road. It screeches to a stop,
          tires smoking. Will jumps out, stumbles to the shoulder and
          pukes. He drops to his knees.
                         
                          WILL
           Oh, god! Holy shit! Fuck me!
           Someone please fucking help me!
                         
          Nothing but the wind.
                         
          Will fights back tears. He gets to his feet, wipes his mouth.
          He takes out his cell phone, scrolls through the contacts.
          He pauses on Chet's name...presses send.
                         
          The line goes to voicemail. Will looks at the bomb's timer:
          7 hours, 47 minutes and counting. He hurries to his car.

          There is a knock at the door. Chet turns to see Will's face

          Will stops, turns back toward Chet.
                         
                          WILL
           Just for the record, this isn't a
           nuclear weapon strapped to my chest.
           And there are metal lockers on either
           side of the hallway. If I fall, and
           if this thing goes off, I'm probably
           not taking out the whole school.
                         
                          CHET
           Do you really want to debate this?
                         
          Will sighs, turns back around. A second later, the school
          bell rings and kids flood the hallway, changing classes.
                         
          Will freezes. Multiple kids shove past him. Chet sweats
          bullets, gives Will a look of death.
                         
          After a beat, the hallway empties again.

           Whatever. It's over.

          EXT. JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
                         
          The guys get to Will's car. Chet wraps up a call on his cell -
                         
                          CHET
           ...thanks so much, Mrs. Davis. I'll
           call you after I talk to the doctor.
                         
          Chet hangs up. He is standing by the passenger door. He
          looks over the roof of the car at Will.
                         
                          CHET

                          CHET
           Once I step inside this car, I'm
           basically in a steel coffin with you
           and...that thing. And if it goes
           off, all they're gonna find in there
           are two charred bodies and pieces of
           a bomb. They'll assume we were driving
           to a government building to blow it
           up. It'll be all over the news.
           Next thing you now, some militia or
           Islam group is claiming us as members.
           My family will be humiliated.
                         
                          WILL
           We'll also be dead, in that particular
           situation, so it won't really matter.
                         
                          CHET
           Exactly!
                         
          Will sighs.
                         
                          WILL
           I get it. Take your time, man.
                         
          Will gets in the car and shuts the door. He looks out at
          Chet, who stands uncertainly by the passenger side.
                         
                          CHET
           This is the world's biggest favor,
           you motherfucker. You didn't even
           help me move last winter.

                          CHET
           Given the situation, I think you
           should obey all traffic safety laws.
                         
                          WILL
           Fine.
                         
          Will pulls out of the school parking lot.
                         
                          WILL
           Okay, so where are we going?
                         
                          CHET
           I have no idea. I just got in your
           car. I thought you had a plan.
           40.
                         
                          WILL
           Well, I don't! I've been sorta
           preoccupied with this crushing fear
           of death!
                         
                          CHET
           No plan. I can't say I'm surprised.
                         
                          WILL
           Your plan is probably better. Just
           condescend me until I explode.
                         
          Will goes to turn on the radio. Chet grabs his hand.
                         
                          CHET
           Maybe we should turn on the radio.
           See if the signal sets the bomb off.
           That would be an interesting experiment.
                         
          Will heaves a frustrated sigh. Chet eases up.
                         
                          CHET
           Listen, let's just go back to my
           place. Figure out our options.
           Maybe you can get the vest off or
           something. I just don't want to do
           anything stupid.
                         
                          WILL
           Unless we have to.
                         
          The car hits a rough pothole. Chet's heart skips a beat -
                         
                          CHET
           Holy fucking shit!
                         
          - and he throws himself against the passenger side window,
          as far from Will as the confines of the car will allow.
                         
          Will slams the brakes.
                         
                          WILL
           Stop it! You're scaring the fuck
           out of me!
                         
                          CHET
           Okay. Okay. Fuck!
                         
          Chet makes the sign of the cross.
                         
                          CHET
           I'm cool now.
                         
          Will continues driving. Chet discreetly unlocks the passenger
          side door.

           It's in case I have to jump out.
                         
                          WILL
           If I survive the day, and you don't
           because you jumped out of a moving
           car and broke your neck, I'm gonna
           laugh my ass off.
                         
                          CHET
           And if abandoning ship saves my life,

          The door is shut. Will sits on the toilet lid. He has the
          jacket off and we get our first complete look at the vest.
          The actual structure is composed of hollow metal tubes. The
          wiring that runs throughout the vest is messy and complicated,
          purposely so, to scare anyone out of fucking with it.
                         
          Will is in the process of trying to contort his arm so he
          can slide the vest off...no luck.

           Well, all these sites say different
           shit. There's not a lot of consensus
           in the bomb disarming community.
                         
          Will emerges from the bathroom, sliding the jacket back on.

           We can't. These guys said they'd be

           clue what they look like. For all I
           know, they're outside right now.

          Chet touches up one of the guns, goes to flip it over.
                         
                          WILL
           That side isn't dry yet. You're
           about to ruin it.

                          WILL
           Fast isn't the same as instant. You
           gotta let it sit for like 20 minutes.
                         
                          CHET

                          WILL
           No, but I spray painted my bike last
           year after I got my license suspended.
           I didn't let it dry properly and I
           fucked it up.
                         
                          CHET
           We don't have time to sit around and
           literally watch paint dry. Aren't
           we going straight to the bank?
                         
                          WILL
           I was actually thinking we need to
           stop and steal a car first.

           Yeah, my car. I'm not gonna use it
           as a getaway vehicle. They can trace
           the plates. Even if we do get away,
           we'll be arrested.
                         
                          CHET
           Well, I can't hotwire a fucking
           automobile, and neither can you.
                         
                          WILL
           That's why I was thinking we'd steal
           one from your parents' friends. The
           Fishers. Remember how they used to
           pay us to clean their garage? They
           leave the keys in there. And they
           have a Datsun. That's a fast car.
                         
                          CHET
           I'm not stealing the Fishers' Datsun.

           friends.
                         
          Will seethes. He whips the car over to the side of the road
          and gets in Chet's face.
                         
                          WILL
           What friends? My parents don't have
           any. My dad moved away after your
           big mouth ruined his marriage and
           humiliated him, and no one wanted to
           hang out with the mom who everyone
           knew fucked a lifeguard.

                          CHET
           You never should have told me! I
           was 13 years old. I couldn't process
           that kind of information. I had to
           tell someone else.
           (shakes his head)
           Fuck. I really am sorry about it.
           Okay? Despite what I said before.
           I was just a kid, but I messed up.
                         
                          WILL
           Okay.
                         
          Chet looks at Will, expectantly.
                         
                          CHET
           That's it? You're not gonna apologize
           for selling my Cal Ripken ball?
                         
                          WILL
           Sure. I'm sorry...I'm sorry that my
           family was going through a rough patch
           and I was smoking a ton of weed and
           listening to the Wu Tang Clan all the
           time. And that I needed some extra
           dough to indulge my habit. Which, in
           hindsight, was probably just a cry
           for help. But you never even noticed.
                         
                          CHET
           Thanks. Now I feel even worse.
                         
          Will sits there, stewing for a moment. Then he softens -
                         
                          WILL
           I shouldn't have stolen the ball. I
           knew it was wrong and I regretted it
           like the next day. I actually tried
           to buy it back but the guy wanted
           twice as much. I had to smoke even
           more weed just to get past the whole
           shitty incident. I guess that's why
           they call it a downward spiral.
                         
                          CHET
           I appreciate that you tried to buy
           it back. So, thanks.
                         
          An awkward moment passes.
                         
                          CHET
           We should probably get going.
                         
          Will turns back around, goes to pull out without looking and -
           52.
                         
          A horn blares as a speeding delivery truck barrels right at
          them. Will slams the brakes, barely avoiding a collision.
                         
                          CHET

          Chet drops ungracefully to the floor, right beside a well
          maintained 1977 Datsun 240Z.
                         
          Chet hurries over and unlocks the side door. Will enters,
          hauling the Walmart bag of supplies. He goes right for a
          set of hooks on the wall.
                         
                          WILL
           The keys aren't here. They always
           used to leave the keys out.
                         
                          CHET

           Let's just find them.
                         
          The guys ransack the garage. Chet knocks over a shelf full
          of clutter.
                         
                          CHET

          Will goes to the car and tries the handle. It's open. He
          scours the interior.

          Chet peeks through the glass pane in the door.

           No!

          Will puts a ski mask on, then throws one to Chet. The door
          opens and MR. FISHER (60s) enters. Chet quickly pulls down
          his mask. It's backwards.

           Yes. By the bomb.

                          WILL
           Would it be so bad if we ended up
           together? You and I would be family.
                         
                          CHET
           I don't want you in the family. You
           bring very little to the table. I
           want her to be with someone awesome.
           A pro quarterback. A war hero. At
           the very least, someone I've never
           watched porn with.
                         
                          WILL
           Well, now it's up to her.
                         
                          CHET
           Not if I set that bomb off myself.
                         
                          WILL
           Then you'd probably never get to rob
           a bank.
                         
          Will throws the car into gear and pulls away.

          EXT. PARKING LOT, DONNER-WELLS NATIONAL BANK - DAY
                         
          The Datsun is parked in the half-full lot. The guys lean
          against the driver side, with their backs to the bank and
          the car providing cover. They each have a spray painted air
          pistol tucked into their pants.
                         
                          WILL
           You go for the money. I'll cover
           the crowd. In and out.
                         
          Chet clasps his hands around his stomach.
                         
                          CHET
           I'm not feeling so good. I drank
           like three of those 5-Hour Energy
           drinks.
                         
                          WILL
           It's just nerves. Let's pull our
           shit together and do this thing.
                         
          Chet reigns it in. The guys slide on the leather gloves and
          rolled up ski masks. They turn and stride toward the bank.
                         
          The guys stop as they get to the door. They pull the ski
          masks down and take out their air pistols.
           63.
                         
                          CHET
           What should I call you in there,
           like if I need to ask you to do
           something?
                         
                          WILL
           Call me Tivon. You'll be Darius.
                         
                          CHET
           I can tell you're not a black guy
           through the ski mask.
                         
                          WILL
           Fine. Then you'll be Luis and I'm
           Cruz. We're two loco motherfuckers
           and that's the way we gotta roll

          INT. DONNER-WELLS NATIONAL BANK - DAY
                         
          It's business as usual for a dozen CUSTOMERS and about as
          many EMPLOYEES. They all just want to get done with their
          shit and go home, when -

           the fucking ground!
                         
          Will and Chet are on an adrenaline high, waving their guns
          everywhere. People scream.

          Will frantically scans the panicked crowd for -
                         
          The SECURITY GUARD (40s), rail thin and jumpy. Will points
          his gun right at him.
                         
                          WILL

          Chet rushes the TELLERS standing behind the bulletproof glass

                          CHET
           All of you, back away from the counter
           and get out here! Anyone pushes a
           button and one of these people gets
           totally shot!
                         
          The Tellers hurry into the main area of the bank and get
          onto their stomachs.
                         
          Will looks to the Guard.

           Very slowly, take out your gun and
           toss it away.
                         
          The Guard takes out his gun, lays it on the ground and shoves
          it away. The gun slides across the waxed floor and -
                         
          Right into the outstretched hand of a sobbing MOM (40s),
          whose DAUGHTER (11) lies beside her in a soccer uniform.

           65.
                         
          The Mom slides the gun away like it were on fire. It skids
          all the way across the floor, slams hard against a wall and

          Nothing. Just the heavy breathing of many frightened people.
                         
          Will hurries over to the Fat Man, who is bent over, hugging
          his leg.

          The Fat Man sits up, removes his hand from his leg. Will
          nervously takes a look. There is only a small amount of
          blood.

          Chet picks out the most harmless looking teller, a mousy 20-
          something girl, and helps her up off the ground. He checks
          her name tag: SANDRA.

          Sandra emerges from behind the partition with the bank bag.
          Will grabs it. He takes a last look at the people spread
          across the floor.

          The Fat Man hesitantly reaches for the bag. Opens it -
                         
          Red Dye explodes all over his face. He shrieks. Chet whirls
          on the teller.

           Could you kindly fill another bag?
           Not a bank bag. A fucking garbage
           bag. And Luis, will you watch her
           this time?
                         
          Sandra hurries back behind the partition with Chet. He dumps
          out the contents of a trash can, grabs the bag and watches
          closely as Sandra stuffs it with cash.
                         
                          CHET
           Okay. That should be enough.

          home free, until -
                         
          They hear the wail of approaching sirens outside. They stop

           all the grease. The Major said I was

           ever laid eyes on. But I didn't care,
           I just wanted to win the money and
           get the fuck out of there. So, one
           night, I followed this skinny register
           kid home, jumped him. I kept whaling
           on him, asking him where they were
           hiding the Park Place piece. The
           million dollar prize. But he didn't
           know shit. A year later, The Major
           won the lotto. I asked him for a
           Sega Genesis. He bought me one of

          Vaughn whirls around toward Chet, just in time to have his
          gun arm smashed by the pipe. The weapon drops from his hand.
          Chet takes another swing, cracking Vaughn across the face.
          He howls, blood spraying, and topples over. Chet goes for
          another swing, when -
                         
          Juicy jumps on him, wildly biting and clawing.
                         
          Will grabs the back of Juicy's track jacket for leverage and
          flings her away. She hits the back of the Sentra and careens
          clear across the trunk.

          bushes. The guys break for the Mustang and get in.
                         
          Juicy gets to her feet, runs right by a dazed Vaughn and
          after the car, which pulls out into the road and leaves her
          behind, screaming and cursing.

          Vaughn has a rag pressed to his swollen, bloody face. Juicy
          is nearby, banged up and dirty. Vaughn yells into his cell -

           just jumped me, tossed my bitch like
           a rag doll and split with the cash.

           Confusion? The only motherfucker
           that's confused is you. Apparently,

           I wasn't fucking you, I was fucking
           him. You gotta understand, you're
           like a pawn in a much larger game

          Vaughn hangs up, tosses the bloody rag to the ground and
          screams in frustration.

                          DWAYNE
           That's it. The assassin's gonna

           fucking over.
                         
          Dwayne cradles his arms around his wounded kidney, rocks
          back and forth, wallowing in defeat.
                         
                          JAY
           We can still get him the money. Try
           the pizza guy back.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Why? So he can fuck around again,
           and I wind up dead, anyway? No.
           I'd rather just sit here. I want to
           die right here on this couch.
                         
                          JAY
           No. We're gonna get that money.
           Just like we planned. All we gotta
           do is get the leverage back.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           How do we do that? Pizza boy's

           We take the girl. The one he went
           to see. Then he won't try shit.
                         
          Dwayne looks up at Jay with something not unlike awe.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           That's actually...that's a great

           idea anyone's had all day.
                         
          Dwayne lowers his head. He removes the gun from his
          belt...holds it out to Jay. Jay takes it. Feels its weight.
          Then offers it back.
                         
                          JAY
           I was just trying to figure out how
           you would do it, Dwayne.
                         
          Dwayne takes the gun. Struggles to stand. Jay helps him.
           89.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Ok. Then let's do it right. We
           leave nothing to chance. Because if
           we go to prison for this, I won't be
           able to watch out for you.

           Ok, Dwayne.
                         
          Dwayne looks over at a frame backpack hanging from a hook on
          the wall. PVC piping bulges from it.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           You should probably bring the
           flamethrower, buddy. There's gonna
           be some evidence to dispose of.

           You know, even if they get the bomb
           squad here in time, and they can
           somehow get this thing off me, we
           still gotta answer for the robbery.

           Nah. I'll tell them I forced you

          Will looks at Chet for a beat.

           That's it? You're not gonna think
           about it a little longer? After all
           we went through...tear down the
           relationship, rebuild it...you're
           gonna let me go to prison alone?

           You offered.
                          WILL
           It was a test. Your grade: F minus.
           You know what the "F" is for?

          Kate goes to the mirror, checks herself out. She's been
          crying. She splashes water on her face, then enters a stall.
                         
          The bathroom door opens and Dwayne and Jay enter. Dwayne
          pulls something hairy from his pocket.
                         
          Inside the stall, Kate reaches for some toilet paper...from
          underneath the barrier, she notices two pairs of dirty,
          masculine sneakers. Her breath goes shallow. She takes out
          her cell, quietly opens it. She presses the first 9 in "911,"
          but her keypad volume is on and the phone makes a dull,
          electronic beep that echoes in the quiet bathroom.
                         
           DWAYNE (O.S.)
           Why don't you just slide the phone

           kick it open and see you with your
           panties down.

          Kate slides the phone out. One of the sneakers crushes it.

          Nothing. The Major gets up and goes to a desk, rifles through
          a drawer and pulls something out. A simple pen. He clutches

          Vaughn shakes his head. Almost imperceptibly, The Major
          repositions the hand with the pen in it. Vaughn is about to
          squeeze the trigger -
                         
          But The Major beats him to it, clicking the pen, which is
          actually a pen gun. It fires a .22 caliber round into Vaughn's
          neck. He drops the gun and clutches the geyser of blood.
                         
          The Major charges Vaughn, jumps on him and wrestles him to
          the ground, trying to jam the pen into the wound in his neck.

          he whips it across The Major's face, knocking him backwards.

           me! None of y'all can kill me!
                         
          The Major looks up at Vaughn, once again face to face with a
          loaded weapon.

          The Major goes limp, one searing hole in his chest.
           93.
                         
          Vaughn clasps a hand to his neck to staunch the flow of blood.
          He steps over the The Major's body and continues upstairs.
                         
          INT. BATHROOM, NICE HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Vaughn rifles through the cabinets, dumps all of the first
          aid supplies into the sink. He gets to work on his wound.
                         
          INT. DWAYNE'S ROOM, NICE HOUSE - DAY
                         
          The locked door is kicked open. Vaughn, neck crudely
          bandaged, flicks on the lights and looks around the childish
          room. Chinese Fighting Fish swim in a large tank, seem to
          stop and look out at him like guard dogs.
                         
          Vaughn ransacks the place. He finds a desk drawer locked.
          Takes out his gun and blows it open.
                         
          Vaughn pulls a stuffed file folder out of the drawer. Flips
          through it. It's full of details about Dwayne's plan, the
          tanning salon, etc.

          He finds a map of the town in the file. Three locations are
          highlighted: the bank, the boarded up gas station, and the
          radio tower. PUSH IN on the radio tower.
                         
          Vaughn stuffs the map into his pocket. He stops before leaving
          the room, turns and shatters the fish tank with the butt of
          his gun. Water spills out and the Chinese Fighting Fish flop
          onto the floor. As Vaughn lifts a boot to stomp them -

          Will stews. After a beat, his hand goes to his pocket.
          It's vibrating. He pulls out his cell.

           great job. And that blonde bitch
           with the sexy voice.
                         
          Will's mind jumps to the only logical conclusion. Roller
          coaster stomach drop. His voice cracks as he asks a useless

          Dwayne hands the phone back to Jay, who puts it to Kate's
          ear. She is trembling.

          Will absorbs this like a blow to the chest. The line
          disconnects.

          vest. He lays it down on the ground and steps away from it.
          His shirt is drenched in sweat from where the bomb sat.
                         
          Will takes a final look at the money bag, then throws it to
          Dwayne. He looks inside, smiles. Jay takes a peak.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           It's so fucking pretty, ain't it?
                         
                          JAY
           Yeah. It's awesome.
           99.
                         
          Dwayne looks up at Will.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Okay, you can get out of here now.
                         
                          WILL
           I actually have this sneaking
           suspicion that once we turn around,
           you're gonna put a bullet in both of
           our backs - and this is just a guess -
           burn our bodies.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           They say great minds think alike.
           And in this case, so do we.
                         
                          WILL
           I figured as much. That's why I got
           a gun pointed at you, too.
                          (LOUDLY)
           I got a sniper in the bushes locked
           on you right now.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Do I look that dumb?
                         
                          WILL
           I can't tell, you're wearing a mask.
                         
          Before Dwayne can react, he stops and blinks, something
          shining in his eyes.
                         
                          JAY
           Hey...on your forehead.
                         
          Dwayne's eyes turn upward, just barely making out the red
          dot that dances on his forehead.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Son of a bitch. Well played.
                         
          In the bushes, hidden from sight, Chet carefully aims his
          laser pointer at Dwayne's forehead.
                         
          Will grins at Dwayne.
                         
                          WILL
           We're gonna walk out of here now.
           If you shoot, my sniper shoots. I
           can't guarantee he'll get both of
           you. But he'll definitely get you.
                         
          As Will turns away -
           100.
                         
           VAUGHN (O.S.)
           Hold the fuck up.
                         
          Vaughn emerges from the darkness. He looks at Will.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           Wasn't expecting to see you here.
                         
          Without warning, Vaughn cracks Will over the head with the
          butt of his gun. He goes down hard. Kate screams. Vaughn
          points the gun at her and she shuts up.
                         
          Dwayne steps forward with the bag.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           It's all good. We got your money.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           Nice mask, Dwayne. Now throw the
           money over here.
                         
          Dwayne complies. As soon as the bag lands, Vaughn aims the
          gun at him.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Hold up. You don't have to do this.
           I just paid you.
                         
          Kate looks on, terrified, an unconscious Will at her side.
                         
          Vaughn's eyes burn a hole through Dwayne.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           I've been hit with a pipe, shot with a
           pen, and wasted my whole motherfucking
           day...all because of you and this job.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I don't know what you're talking about.
           Just take the money.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           I will. And then I'm gonna tie up the
           two loose ends in the gorilla masks.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I'm not a loose end!
                         
                          VAUGHN
           You're a fucking idiot. You are as
           loose as ends get.
                         
          Panicked, Dwayne's eyes flash over to Jay, who tightens his
          grip on the flamethrower handle. Jay catches Dwayne's eye.
          Dwayne nods. Vaughn sees this.
           101.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           What the -
                         
          Jay rears up with the flamethrower. Vaughn couldn't be more
          surprised to see the device Jay is holding spit a massive
          ball of fire at him.
                         
          Vaughn dives to the ground, fires off two wild shots, one of
                         WHICH -
                         
          Nails Dwayne in the shoulder, spinning him backward and
          knocking him off his feet.
                         
          Kate recoils in horror as: Vaughn scurries madly on the
          ground, intermittently firing, while Jay screams and tries
          to torch him with the 25-foot flame. A hand touches Kate's
          shoulder and she whirls around to find -
                         
                          KATE
           Chet!? What are you doing here!?
                         
                          CHET
           Not now. We gotta take off.
                          (LOOKS AROUND)
           Where's Will?
                         
          Kate looks to the empty spot beside her where Will just was.
                         
          Flames inches from him, Vaughn lines up a desperate shot -
                         
          Good news: the bullet only grazes Jay's side. Bad news: it
          keeps going and punches through the flamethrower backpack,
          which happens to be filled with gasoline, which happens to
          have an incredibly low flash point. So the spark from, say,
          a bullet, would cause
                         
          AN ERUPTION OF FLAMES
                         
          Meanwhile, Will pops up behind Chet and Kate, clutching the
          garbage bag.
                         
                          WILL
           I got the money. Let's get the fuck
           out of here.
                         
          They take off toward Will's car.
                         
          Dwayne groggily comes to...no SOUND, just a ringing. The
          first thing he sees: Vaughn storming toward him, god-knows-
          what spewing from his mouth. Vaughn levels his gun -
                         
          It doesn't make a sound for two reasons. The second being
          that it's out of bullets.
                         
          Dwayne fumbles for his own hardware. Muzzle flash.
           102.
                         
          Vaughn drops to his knees. Pulse snatched from him.
                         
          SOUND SLAMS BACK to the tune of Jay's screams. Dwayne looks
          over to see his friend in flames, flailing his arms and
          shrieking. Dwayne's head snaps to the other side, where he
          sees the Mustang's tires peel. He tears off his mask,
          frantically looks around. The money is gone.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           No!!
                         
          Jay disentangles himself from the backpack, the source of
          the flames, but his clothes are now ablaze. In his frenzy,
          he somehow manages to string together two coherent words -
                         
                          JAY
           Dwayne! Help!
                         
          Dwayne gets to his feet as the Mustang roars down the
          driveway. He looks to Jay, then to his minivan. Dwayne's
          face: Two roads diverge in a wood. Which to take?
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Goddamn it, Jay!
                         
          Dwayne sprints over to Jay, rips off his jacket and uses it
          to beat the flames down.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Stop, drop and roll!
                         
          Jay hits the deck. Dwayne continues fighting the flames,
          finally falls on top of Jay with the jacket spread and
          smothers the last of them out.
                         
          Jay looks up at Dwayne with puppy dog eyes.
                         
                          JAY
           You came back for me...you said you
           never would.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           You didn't hesitate back there, Jay.
           You did good.
                         
          Jay smiles. Flames overtake the field all around them.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I'm gonna go put a bullet in that
           motherfucker and get our money.
           Think you can get outta here?
                         
                          JAY
           Yeah. Go get him.
           103.
                         
          Dwayne hurries toward the minivan. Jay stumbles up to his
          feet and limps off toward the woods.
                         
          EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

          INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT - MOVING
                         
          Will's face is a mess of dirt, sweat and dried blood. He
          and Chet stare ahead, completely shell-shocked.
                         
          Kate looks from one of them to the other.

                          CHET
           Yeah, that was totally Will's fault.
           In case you want to factor that in

           I'm very sorry about the kidnapping.
           This is me, taking responsibility
           for it. Growing up. Like a viable
           life partner.

           He's lying. He's trying to build a
           relationship on a foundation of lies.
           And it won't stand.
                         
                          KATE
           I just got kidnapped! Can we talk
           about that!?
                         
          Something catches Will's attention: a set of headlights
          rapidly growing larger in the rear-view mirror.

          He gestures to a very ordinary looking tanning bed.
           111.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Hey, don't just take this scientist's
           word for it. The proof...
                         
          Dwayne snaps his fingers. A BAD SPECIAL EFFECT makes him
          disappear, then reappear with a totally orange tan.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           ...is in the tan.
                         
          We follow Dwayne back out into the hallway.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           But Major Tan isn't just about looking
           good. It's also about feeling good.
                         
          Dwayne gestures to another room. The door opens and Juicy
          saunters out in a bikini. A beat later, a RANDOM GUY exits.
                         
                          RANDOM GUY
           That "Deluxe Tan" was fantastic!
                         
          EXT. MAJOR TAN - DAY (LOCAL COMMERCIAL)
                         
          Dwayne stands outside the store.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           So come on down to Major Tan...where
           we're proud to be a family business.
                         
          PULL BACK TO REVEAL...The Major beside Dwayne. He's only
          about four feet tall now, on account of the wheelchair. But
          he's grinning like a jackal, in a POW-MIA cap.
                         
          A SUPERED LOGO appears: Military Discounts Available!
