          Desolate. In the far off distance a man is jogging. He banks
          around the end of a small pond and runs right at us. This is
          MIKE FLAHERTY, FORTY-TWO. He is running hard. Or at least as
          hard as he can.
                         
          Suddenly TWO JOGGERS blow past him.
