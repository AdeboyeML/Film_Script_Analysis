           Tell me one thing. Would you like
           to be a guy who goes back to jail
           or to the hospital? Hmm? So take
           your medication and if you do fine,

           Pat, there's a possibility, and I
           want you to be prepared for it,
           that she may not return. True love
           is about letting her go and seeing
           if she returns. In the meantime, if
           you listen to that song, I don't
           want you to fall apart. So get a
           strategy, okay? You need one.

           you can, you have to work your

           positive, you have a shot at a
           silver lining.

                          PAT
           Let me just set the record straight
           about last night. Hurting my mother
           was a mistake and I hate myself for
           it, and I hate my illness and I
           want to control it. My father, on
           the other hand, had no trouble
           slapping the shit out of me last
           night, which I did not return
           `cause I could've killed him and I
           didn't. He's sixty-five years old.
           You don't think I could've beat the
           shit out of him? I mean....

           DR. PATEL
           He was scared for your mother and
           you hurt him as well.

                          PAT
           Yes, last night was a mess. Okay?
           And I think he probably just tried
           to do his best.

           DR. PATEL
           Pat, you have to have a strategy. I
           told you earlier. You need to
           recognize these feelings coming to
           you, otherwise you will be sent
           back to Baltimore. So when you get
           these feelings, you need to get to
           a quieter place, and be at peace
           with yourself, however you can.

                          PAT
           Yeah, but that's easier said than
           done.

          in eight and a half months?

           DR. PATEL
          Maybe you think that Nikki's not
          around and Tiffany's an attractive
          girl and if you get drawn towards
          Tiffany, you will spoil your
          chances of getting Nikki back to
          you?

                          PAT
          Not bad, Doctor Jones. But I don't
          think I'm gonna blow it with Nikki
          because Tiffany's a slut.

           DR. PATEL
          Why is she a slut?

                          PAT
          After the dinner at Ronnie's, she
          said, quote, "We can go to the back
          house and you can fuck me as long
          as we turn the lights out."
          Unquote. And she still wears her
          wedding ring. So she's a loyal,
          married-to-a-dead-guy slut.

           DR. PATEL
          Maybe she just needs a friend and
          she thought if she offers you sex,
          it will be easier for you to become
          friends with her.

                          PAT
          She said she's not a whore anymore,
          but she likes that part of herself
          along with all the other parts of
          herself and can I say the same?

           Yes.

           DR. PATEL
           Pat, the silver lining thing is
           yours. I'm just giving back your
           words to you. This "crazy sad
           shit," as you call it, made you a
           happier, calmer person with a
           beautiful positive philosophy of
           going outdoors, working out, and
           reading books.

                          PAT
           No, not the books.

           DR. PATEL
           You said Nikki's friends with
           Ronnie, Veronica and Tiffany. So if
           you become friends with Tiffany,
           Nikki will think that you're a
           kind, generous, large-hearted
           person, who helps people in need,
           who is basically thriving. So if

           getting back with Nikki is, and
           I've been doing pretty well. Except
           for a minor incident at the
           doctor's office.

           Yeah. That was a thing with my
           parents. I wish I could just
           explain it all in a letter to Nikki
           because it was minor and I could
           just explain it and let her know
           that I'm actually not out of
           control and that I'm actually doing
           really well.

           Why don't you walk towards me like
           I'm Nikki. And the only way to
           convey how much you've missed me is
           by your walk. By your slow walk.

           We were married for three years and
           five days, and I loved him. But for
           the last couple months, I just
           wasn't into sex at all. It just
           felt like we were so different and
           I was depressed. Some of that is
           just me, some of it was he wanted
           me to have kids and I have a hard
           enough time taking care of myself.
           I don't think that makes me a
           criminal. Anyway one night after
           dinner, he drove to Victoria's
           Secret at King of Prussia Mall and
           got some lingerie to get something
           going. And on the way back, he
           stopped on 76 to help a guy with a
           flat tire and he got hit by a car
           and killed. And the Victoria's
           Secret box was still in the front
           seat. (pause) That's a feeling.

           "Dear Pat, It was very emotional
           for me to get your letter, as I'm
           sure you can imagine, but I'm glad
           you took the risk of discreetly
           getting it to me through Tiffany.
           This gives us a chance to
           communicate while I keep the
           restraining order until I feel
           safe. I must admit you sound
           terrific and I'm happy that you are
           feeling so positive and becoming a
           more loving and caring man, which I
           always knew you were. I was moved
           to read about `Excelsior' and your
           belief in happy endings. I am also
           moved by your act of love to read
           the books I have taught at the high
           school. I'm sorry you find them so
           negative, but I disagree. I think
           they are great works of art that
           reflect how hard life can be and
           they can also help kids prepare
           themselves for the hardness of
           life. In spite of all these
           positive developments, Pat, I have
           to say if it's me reading the
           signs, I need to see something to
           prove you are ready to resume our
           marriage. Otherwise I find myself
           thinking that we might both be
           better off moving on with our lives
           separately. Please don't react
           quickly to this, but take time to
           think about it. I'm glad you're
           doing so well. Love, Nikki."

           They go by the Philadelphia rules.
           Each dancer is scored on a scale of
           one to ten, ten being the highest.
           You have to average the four
           judges' scores.
