          1 INT. TOWNHOUSE/STUDY - DAY 1


           -EARLY APRIL, 1841-
           We are close on a PAIR OF BLACK HANDS as they open A

           FINELY WRAPPED PACKET OF VIOLIN STRINGS.

           WE CUT TO the hands stringing a VIOLIN. It's not a high
           end piece, but it is quite nice.

           WE CUT TO a wide shot of the study. Sitting in a chair
           with violin in hand is SOLOMON NORTHUP; a man in his late
           twenties. Everything about Solomon, his mien and manner,
           is distinguished. But he, too, seems a hardy individual.
           Someone who has known manual labor in his time.

           Solomon begins to lightly play his violin, as if testing
           the strings, their tuning. Satisfied, Solomon begins to
           play vigorously. As he does, we make a HARD CUT TO:

                         


           INT. HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           We come in on a lively affair. A dinner party is being
           thrown within the confines of a fairly stately house. In
           attendance are EIGHT COUPLES. All are WHITE and all are
           FAIRLY YOUNG, in their early twenties. The men and women
           are dressed in very fine attire. We should get the sense
           that for the most part they are people of means.

           The furniture has been set aside in the living room. At
           the moment the couples are engaged in the dancing of a
           REEL.

           The music they are dancing to is being played by Solomon,
           having cut directly from the tune he was previously
           playing. He plays with a light determination, and in no
           way seems possessed with empty servitude.

           Solomon concludes the reel, and the dancers break into
           enthusiastic applause, which is followed by personal
           thanks and congratulations from all. It should be clear
           that despite their respective races there is much
           admiration and appreciation for Solomon's abilities.

                         


           INT. NORTHUP HOUSE/BEDROOM - MORNING

           It is a Saturday morning. Clad in her finest attire is
           ANNE; Solomon's wife, a few years younger than he. We
           see also the Northup children: MARGARET who is eight, and
           ALONZO who is five. They are handsome, and well groomed
           kids. Anne straightens up the children. She finishes,

           she rises up and stands behind them, almost as if
           preparing to pose for a portrait.
           They all wait a moment, then Solomon enters the foyer.
           He stands and looks admiringly at his family. ADMIRINGLY
           stressed. It isn't that he doesn't have love for them,
           he does as well. But in the moment, he truly admires his
           greatest accomplishment: a family that is healthy and
           well and provided for. He goes to his children, and
           hands each a coin, then goes to Anne. Gives her a kiss
           on the cheek. The children giggle at the sight.

                         


           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Solomon and his family are out walking along the streets
           and groves of Saratoga.

           The streets are well populated this morning with many
           people out strolling. Most are WHITE, but there are
           BLACKS as well. They are FREED BLACKS who mingle fairly
           easily - though not always completely - with the whites.
           We see, too, a few BLACK SLAVES who travel with their
           WHITE MASTERS. These pairings are largely from the south
           and - despite the fact the blacks are slaves - they are
           not physically downtrodden, not field hands. They are
           well dressed and "leading apparently an easy life" -
           comparatively speaking - as they trail their masters.

           As they walk, Solomon and his family arrive to an
           intersection well-worn and muddied from horse and cart
           traffic. Solomon and his children easily jump across the
           muck. Anne stands at the lip of the puddle, calls for
           Solomon to help her across.

                          ANNE
           Solomon...
           Solomon, turning back to his wife with a broad smile
           waving her forward:

                          SOLOMON
           Come, Anne. Jump.

           The children, now smiling as well, egg their mother on.

                          ALONZO MARGARET
           Jump. You can make it. I've done it. You can make
           it.

                         

                          ANNE
           I will not ruin my dress. Catch
           me!

           Solomon moves close, holds out his arms. Yet, there's
           still just a bit of mischievousness in his eyes. Anne
           gives her husband a lightly stern look to which Solomon
           replies.

                          (BEAT)
           I will.
           Again, lightly stern:

                          ANNE
           You will.

           And with that Anne takes the leap. Solomon catches her,
           swings her around grandly and sets her down lightly to
           the delighted applause of the children. That done,
           Solomon takes Anne's hand and leads her on.

           As Solomon and his family make their way, among the
           slaves on the street, we see one in particular; JASPER.
           As he trails his MASTER he can't help but note Solomon
           and his family as they enter A STORE. His intrigue of
           this most handsome and harmonious group should be
           obvious.

           With his Master occupied, Jasper moves slyly toward the
           STORE. Frozen on the spot, Jasper looks on admiringly.
           Suddenly a voice barks out-

           We are inside the store of MR. CEPHAS PARKER; a white man
           and a supplier of general goods. Solomon greets him

           Using a long pole, Mr. Parker fetches down a CARRY ALL
           from an upper shelf.

                          PARKER
           Something to suit your style, but
           sturdy enough for the forty miles
           round trip.
           Handing the Bag to Anne, she is immediately taken by it.

                          ANNE
           It's beautiful.

           We will take it. Children, come
           see what your father has just
           purchased for me.
           As the children run over - chattering excitedly about the
           new gift - they RUN PAST JASPER who has quietly entered
           the store.
           At the checkout counter sits a portrait of WILLIAM HENRY
           HARRISON, the edges draped in black crepe. Before the
           book sits a LEDGER. Mr. Parker asks of Solomon:

                          PARKER
           If you would sign our condolence
           book. My hope is to find a way to

           We are just outside the Northup house. A CARRIAGE waits
           with a DRIVER. Anne and the children are dressed for
           travel - Anne sporting HER NEW CARRY ALL. The Driver
           loads bags into the carriage.
           For her parting gift, Anne gives her husband a kiss.

           good bye to his wife and children.

           Solomon is now out for a stroll. He passes two men - two
           in particular - who stand outside conversing with MR.
           MOON himself: MERRILL BROWN and ABRAM HAMILTON. Brown
           is about 40, with a countenance indicating shrewdness and
           intelligence. Hamilton is closer to 25, a man of fair
           complexion and light eyes. Both are finely, if perhaps a
           bit garishly, dressed. Hamilton, as Solomon describes
           him, slightly effeminate.
           Moon, spotting Solomon:

           MR. MOON
           Call the Devil's name... There he
           is now. Mr. Northup...! I have

           Mr. Northup, these two gentlemen
           were inquiring about distinguished
           individuals, and I was just this
           very moment telling them that
           Solomon Northup is an expert
           player on the violin.

           remains cool, Hamilton and Brown put up a great show of
           being disappointed as Hamilton counts out what little
           money was collected.

                          HAMILTON
           Not an additional tip from a one
           of them. They expect to be
           entertained for nothing.

           My sincerest apologies, Solomon.
           You were promised opportunity, and
           you were given none.

                          BROWN
           The opportunity is with the
           circus. A two man show poorly
           promoted, what were we to expect?

           Hamilton is placing a spittoon near Solomon's bed, where
           a prone and reeling Solomon lays. Hamilton sits on the
           bed. As he strokes Solomon's sweaty face, Hamilton
           speaks sweetly.

           as well and refreshed as though
           the earth were new again.
           Hamilton lingers a bit too long and a bit too close to
           Solomon for Brown's taste. With more than a bit of

           away from the bed. He crosses to, and BLOWS OUT A
           CANDLE. The room goes dark with a blackness more than
           night. Brown and Hamilton exit. Solomon lays in the

           Solomon stirs, then slowly awakes to his new
           circumstances. He finds himself in a nearly lightless
           room about twelve feet square with walls of solid
           masonry. There is a thick and well-locked door, a small
           window covered with iron bars and a shutter. The only
           furniture is a wood stool and an old fashioned, dirty box
           stove. As Solomon rises he sees that his HANDS are
           CUFFED - the chain running to a bolt in the ground - and
           his LEGS IN IRONS. At first Solomon is incredulous. But
           that emotion is replaced first by fury and then panic.
           He begins to pull on the chains, fight against them. He
           does so with increasing desperation. Solomon flails
           about, the sounds of the steel chains whipping and
           beating against the masonry. He grunts and screams
           without regard as the cuffs and irons bite into his
           flesh, but he cannot pull himself free.
           After several minutes of intense effort, Solomon tires,
           slows, then finally he collapses. And in this collapsed
           state he remains.

           Solomon again awakens. He hears sounds beyond the
           door...footsteps. Eventually the door opens. Enter
           JAMES BURCH - who runs the slave pen - and EBENEZER
           RADBURN who works as a turnkey and overseer.
           As the door opens, this is the first light to seep into
           the otherwise near-black room. The shine is painful to
           Solomon's eyes. With no salutation whatsoever, Burch

           Solomon rises up as best he can. With all the resolve he
           can put together he states what he considers to be fact:

           With confidence Solomon goes to the pocket of his
           trousers. He searches one, then the other, but they are
           empty. He feels quickly about himself, but clearly his
           papers have been lifted. Solomon's confidence shifts,
           but to resolve rather than fear. Papers or none, he will
           not be easily cowed. Still, Burch asserts:

                          BURCH (CONT'D)
           Yah no free man. And yah ain't
           from Saratoga. Yah from Georgia.
           A moment. Not a word spoken among the trio, but Solomon
           and Burch do some serious eye fucking, neither man
           yielding. Burch says again:

                          BURCH (CONT'D)
           Yah ain't a free man. Yah nuthin'
           but a Georgia runaway.
           Burch waits for Solomon to acquiesce. Solomon does not
           in any way. Both men exchange a long and daring stare.
           The two are clearly at an intellectual stand off. Burch,
           leans to Radburn, SAYS SOMETHING WHICH WE CANNOT

           DISTINGUISH.
           Radburn walks off-camera and returns with a pair of
           "instruments:" a PADDLE - the flattened portion, which is
           about the size in circumference of two open hands, and
           bored with a small auger in numerous places. He also
           carries a WHIP. A cat-o-nine tails; a large rope of many
           strands. The strands unraveled and a knot tied at the
           extremity of each. Burch says again:

                          BURCH (CONT'D)
           Yah a runaway nigger from Georgia.
           Solomon stands with a quiet stoicism. He will say
           nothing of the kind.
           As that is the case, Solomon is seized by both men. He is
           pulled over the bench, face downward, shirt still on his
           back. Radburn then STEPS ON HIS CHAINS, holding Solomon
           down in a bent position.
           With no preamble, Burch begins to beat Solomon about the
           back with the paddle. Burch strikes him wordlessly - no
           taunting, no sneering. Solomon screaming against each
           blow. His back immediately SWELLING WITH WELTS AND

           BRUISES.
           This beating continues on and on and on until quite
           literally Burch WEARS HIMSELF OUT with the effort.
           Dripping in sweat and panting:

           Burch regrets hearing this. Not from sympathy, but
           rather because he's nearly too tired to go back to
           beating Solomon. Yet, as if returning to work, Burch
           returns to pummeling Solomon. Burch punctuates the blows

           Yah a slave. Yah a Georgia slave!
           Burch continues to strike, and strike... This time until
           the paddle SNAPS IN HALF. Burch then GRABS THE WHIP.
           Hardly missing a stroke, he whips Solomon relentlessly,
           the flails cutting into Solomon's back. Again, Burch's
           arm tires before Solomon "breaks."

           SOLOMON'S BACK IS NOW TORN OPEN WITH LACERATIONS AND
           OOZING WITH BLOOD. Finally Burch can whip no more. He
           pours sweat and sucks air, leaving himself just enough
           energy to take up his instruments and EXIT. Radburn
           lingers for a moment. He takes the irons off Solomon's
           legs. Opens the window some. As he makes these
           gestures, in a patronizing and confidential manner, one
           wrought with poor sincerity::

           think; what was all the beatin'
           and abuse for? Things end as they
           should, and the violence was for
           naught. So why cause trouble when
           they ain't no cause for it? Be of

           wearing when first kidnapped - and puts on the one
           Radburn brought him. The shirt's ill-fitting and dirty.

           Though a slave, Eliza was a mistress and has - to this
           point - lived well. This is reflected in her airs and
           her speech. The other is a little girl, light in skin

           half sister.
           As she enters the yard Eliza squeals with high delight,
           then breaks into tears of both sorrow and joy. Clearly

           Built it on the sole condition

           added promise in time I would be

           But Master Berry's daughter...she
           always looked at me with an unkind

           she and Emily were flesh of flesh.
           As Master Berry's health failed,
           she gained power in the household.
           Eventually, I was brought to the

           Sardines are laid out to dry in rows, glittering in the 
           day's sun as if like silver pennies. A chain of slaves 
           enter the frame and are led one by one on to the docked 
           vessel. 
           MORE SLAVES - about 15 in all, of various genders and 
           ages - are brought on board. Chief among them is ROBERT 
           who fights viciously with his captors. "With all haste" 
           is shoved down into the hold. 
           Having taken their cargo as far as they care or need to, 
           Burch and Radburn depart. They do so without a word 
           spoken to Solomon or the others. 
           With this new and sizable batch of slaves on board, the 
           crew again CASTS OFF, and the Orleans makes its way

           down and attempts to wake the daughter by caressing her 
           face. 
           Solomon rouses, and looks across to witness the scene. 
           From his vantage point, we see Eliza stand to interrupt 
           the Sailor. The Sailor looks at Eliza, Eliza looks back 
           at him. Knowingly she leads him off into a corner of the 
           hold. 
           As she does so, Eliza passes Robert who jumps up to stand 
           between Eliza and the Sailor. Stretching out a firm hand

           Robert looks down. We follow his gaze to the knife that 
           has already been jabbed unseen between Robert's ribs.

           On the dock itself there is a bustle of activity as goods
           are loaded and unloaded from a various ships. It's a bit
           of controlled chaos as a VARIETY OF LANGUAGES are spoken
           and shouted while slaves are shuttled from the Orleans to
           a holding pen. Solomon, and all the slaves are
           overwhelmed by all that is happening around them.
           Two men - among many - are awaiting the arrival of the
           Orleans. They are JONUS RAY - Clemens Ray's master - and
           DAVIS who is the solicitor of Mr. Ray. They both look
           like they mean business. The moment the gangplank is
           laid, Ray yells for Clemens.
           Clemens, seeing his master, is nearly crazy with delight.
           He is, uncharacteristically beside himself. Ironically,

           Solomon is carted off along with the rest of "Burch's
           stock:" Eliza and her children, John and Solomon.
           As they move off from the port in a make-shift cart, it
           opens up to the frenzic, busy port.
           For the first time Solomon sees true and severe slavery.
           These are not visiting servants, such as Jasper was back
           in Saratoga. These are humans held in strict bondage -
           herded like cattle, chained together as if in a "chain
           gang." Slaves are evident not merely by the color of
           their skin. The residue and accessories of slavery are
           everywhere. Blacks almost universally display scars -

           THICK AND HEAVY DEAD TISSUE FROM LACERATIONS LEFT
           UNTREATED - brands, and are often missing limbs. Blacks
           are held in all types of shackles, from simple chains to
           elaborate bindings, to neck collars that are spiked.
           Some are muzzled or forced to wear bits. One slave is
           attacked by a dog and the slave owner. The dog pulls and
           tears at the slave's clothes. THESE IMAGES SHOULD BE A

           CONSTANT AND CONTINUAL CANVAS TO THE PIECE. EVER

           "Burch's stock:" arrive at Freeman's slave pen. They are
           led in by Freeman and his house slave CAPE - a mulatto.
           The yard is enclosed by plank, standing upright, with
           ends sharpened instead of brick walls as with Burch's.
           Including Burch's group there are about 30 SLAVES in the
           pen.
           Solomon and the others look around and see nothing but
           downtrodden and despondent faces. Three men sit next to
           each other with muzzles and quietly stare back at this
           new batch of arrivals. One attempts to speak, but all
           that comes out is a muffled, unintelligible sound.

           The slaves are in various states of undress, men and
           women alike. They clean themselves, scrubbing with soap
           and water. Women wash their hair. Men shave, skin is
           oiled. Freeman walks among them, inspecting them as they
           primp themselves.

           It's an odd, ironic scene. The slaves are in a large and
           fairly ornate room within Freeman's house. CAPE PLAYS A
           PAINFUL TUNE ON A FIDDLE - background music - as Freeman
           tries to line up A SMALL GROUP OF THE SLAVES, he becomes
           less patient, jittery and nervous, knowing that his
           livelihood is at stake, he wants his slaves to make a
           good impression. Sometimes his patience gets the better
           of him, and his hands move freely in direction of the
           slaves.
           The business has the air of an etiquette class, though
           what Freeman is trying to do is coach the slaves into
           being more "sellable." He works with them in groups of
           five or so.

           Weary of Cape's playing, Solomon moves to Cape. He asks:

           Cape reluctantly hands the fiddle over to Solomon.
           Solomon tunes it a bit, then begins to play. His fingers
           stiff at first, he takes a moment to warm up. But as he
           warms up he is, despite the circumstances, masterful.

           We come in on an odd sort of sight; A JUMBLE OF ACTIVITY.
           CUSTOMERS have come to see Freeman's lot - the room all
           gussied up with flowers. Freeman moves among them,
           displaying them as a rancher would prize chattel.
           Freeman makes the slaves hold their heads up - "look
           smart" as he previously admonished them. They are made
           to walk briskly back and forth while customers feel their
           hands and arms and bodies, turn them about and ask what
           skills they possess. The Customers routinely make the
           slaves open their mouths and show their teeth.
           At times a MALE or FEMALE SLAVE are taken off to the
           side, stripped and inspected more minutely.
           One of them, John, is stripped and inspected.
           Cape, as he's done previously, plays his fiddle.
           A buyer - WILLIAM FORD; a man of middle age, and an
           attractive nature in his tone of voice - consults a list
           he's drawn up and asks of Freeman:

           What is the price for the ones
           Platt and Eliza?

           A thousand for Platt; he is a
           nigger of talent. Seven hundred

           Mister Chapin is the overseer on 
           this plantation. He is

           traverse the Texas road between 
           the forest site and the sawmill in

           that path that gets a little 
           lightfooted, I will remind him

           We are in a wooded area. There is A GANG OF SLAVES
           chopping trees into timber. It is hard, laborious work
           made no more easy by the sweltering heat. Solomon is
           among them as well as Sam.

           It is a sizable work area on the edge of Indian Creek.
           There is much work being done, the slaves primarily
           employed in piling the timber and chopping it into
           lumber. As before, there is little doubt about the
           rigors of the job at hand.
           Working as a carpenter at the work area is JOHN TIBEATS.
           There are also various CUSTOMERS who move about placing
           orders.

           the lawn just beyond the piazza. Mistress Ford is
           present as well. As the slaves listen, Ford reads to
           them Scripture. His tone is of a man trying to preach by
           way of compassion.

                          FORD
           "But as touching the resurrection
           of the dead, have ye not read that
           which was spoken unto you by God,
           saying, I am the God of Abraham,
           and the God of Isaac, and the God
           of Jacob. God is not the God of
           the dead, but of the living. And
           when the multitude heard this,
           they were astonished at his
           doctrine. Then one of them, which
           was a lawyer, asked him a
           question, tempting him, and
           saying, Master, which is the
           great commandment in the law?
           Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt
           love the Lord thy God with all thy
           heart, and with all thy soul, and
           with all thy mind. This is the
           first and great commandment. And
           the second is like unto it, thou
           shalt love thy neighbor as
           thyself. On these two
           commandments hang all the law and
           the prophets."
           Despite the lightness with which Ford speaks and the hope
           in his words, ELIZA SITS OFF TO THE SIDE - SELF-SECLUDED

           A BIT - WEEPING GENTLY.
           We should be able to see in Mistress Ford's eyes that
           Eliza's constant crying is unsettling.

           The slaves have broken for lunch. They snack on smoked
           meat and drink water from gourds. As they lunch Solomon
           reads from Sam's Bible to the other slaves.

           that serveth.
           A white customer - WINSLOW - irate at the sight and sound

           the wagon to a halt. He, and the slaves look up the road
           ahead of them.
           Standing in the middle of the road is a group of
           CHICKASAWS INDIANS. They are in their "usual" dress of
           buckskin breeches and calico hunting shirts of fantastic
           colors, buttoned from belt to chin. They have with them
           DOGS and HORSES. They carry with them the carcass of a
           deer.

           well the group share a smoke on a pipe.
           One of the Chickasaws is playing a tune on an "INDIAN
           FIDDLE." The Chickasaws perform a customary dance;
           trotting after each other, and giving utterance to a
           guttural, sing-song noise.

           waters of Indian Creek. After a few moments, as though a
           thought far greater than relieving himself has come to

           manner. A long moment passes with no sign of Solomon.
           Then, from up river, we see Solomon's raft of lumber
           winding its way. SLAVES CHEER, and Ford literally
           applauds the effort. Tibeats looks pissed. He has just
           been shown up after all.

           As we come into the scene, Ford is presenting Solomon
           with a fiddle. Not as grand as the one he previously
           owned in New York, but a fine instrument none the less.
           It is a gift of thanks for his hard work. Solomon's
           gratitude is easily expressed.

           Following the statement, Solomon's not sure how to react.
           He remains grateful, but the thought of "over the years"
           is just a reminder of the altered state in which he now
           finds himself.

           Goddamn yah! I thought yah knowed
           somethin'!
           Solomon, perhaps inspired by his moment with Eliza, is in
           no mood for Tibeats.

                          SOLOMON
           I did as instructed. If there's
           something wrong, then its wrong
           with your instructions.

           Yah black bastard! Yah goddman
           black bastard!
           In an inconsolable rage, Tibeats runs off to the piazza
           to fetch a whip.
           Solomon looks around. He is alone other than Rachel and
           Mistress Ford who, shocked by that which she witnesses,
           runs out to the field to fetch Chapin. Solomon's
           instinct is to run, but he stands his ground as Tibeats
           marches back whip in hand.

                          TIBEATS (CONT'D)

           Solomon does no such thing.

                          SOLOMON

           With "concentrated vengeance," Tibeats springs for
           Solomon, seizing him by the throat with one hand and

           raising the whip with the other. Before he can strike
           the blow, however, Solomon catches Tibeats by the collar
           of his coat and pulls him in close. Reaching down,
           Solomon grabs Tibeats by the ankle and pushes him back
           with the other hand. Tibeats tumbles to the ground. A
           violent struggle takes place as Solomon puts a foot to
           Tibeats throat, and then in a frenzy of madness snatches
           the whip from Tibeats and begins to strike him with the
           handle again and again and again.

                          TIBEATS
           Yew will not live ta see another
           day, nigger! This is yer last, I
           swear it!
           Solomon ignores the threats, continues to beat Tibeats.
           Blow after blow falling fast and heavy on Tibeats's
           wriggling form. The stiff stock of the whip wraps around
           Tibeats's cringing body until Solomon's arm aches.
           Tibeats's cries of vengeance turn to yelps for help and
           then pleas for mercy:

                          TIBEATS (CONT'D)
           Murder! It's murder! Lord, God,
           help me. God be merciful!
           And then suddenly, Tibeats shrieks-

                          TIBEATS (CONT'D)
           Papa I'm sorry!
           Chapin comes RIDING IN FROM THE FIELD fast and hard.
           Solomon strikes Tibeats a blow or two more, then delivers
           a well-directed kick that sends Tibeats rolling over the
           ground.

                          CHAPIN
           What is the matter?
           Tibeats struggles up and tries to present an air of
           dignity and control while he keeps a demonic eye on

           Mr. Tibeats?
           Tibeats answer is in the grinding of his teeth and the
           shaking of his fist.

                          TIBEATS
           This ain't done by half. I will
           have flesh, and I will have all of
           it.
           Tibeats moves off toward, and then INTO THE HOUSE.
           Chapin follows. A long moment, Solomon stands alone. He
           looks around, not sure what to do; to stay or to flee.
           Anxiety mounts on his features.
           A moment more, and Tibeats EXITS the house. He saddles
           his horse and rides off to beat the devil. Or, worse, to
           fetch him.
           Chapin comes running back out of the house. He is
           visibly excited, and when he speaks he is quite earnest.
           Though he tries to project reasoned emotions he gives off
           an air of impending trouble.

                          CHAPIN
           Do not stir. Do not attempt to
           leave the plantation on any
           account whatever. But if you run
           there is no protecting you.

           Chapin runs off to join Rachel. The two converse at a
           distance from Solomon, then they head off for the log
           kitchen.
           Solomon is now very much alone, and he waits for what is
           to come. AND WE WAIT WITH HIM. And we wait, and we
           continue to wait... Moment by moment, the dread of the
           unexpected mounts.
           Solomon's eyes begin to well. He has beaten a white man,
           and he knows that death awaits him.

           A SLIGHT PRAYER TO THE HEAVENS BEGINS TO FORM IN HIS
           THROAT, but he is too choked up to fully speak it.

           Chapin has now returned to the piazza. He stands and
           watches, but does not move to Solomon.
           Solomon waits, and waits...
           WE HEAR THE SOUND OF DISTANT HOOFS which grow louder and
           louder in the manner of rolling thunder. It's Tibeats.
           He returns with two accomplices; RAMSAY and COOK. They
           carry with them large whips and a coil of rope.

                          TIBEATS
           Tha's the one. Tha's him.
           Dismounting, they move with menace that is tinged with
           perverse pleasure and wordless malevolence. Solomon
           tries to fight back, but he is strong armed and tied by
           TIBEATS - his wrists, and then ankles bound in the same
           manner. In the meantime the other two have slipped a
           cord within Solomon's elbows, running it across his back
           and tying it firmly. Solomon is then dragged toward a
           peach tree. A lynching is in store. The naked horror of
           it intensely palpable.
           Solomon looks toward the piazza, but Chapin is now gone.
           Tears of fear flow down Solomon's cheeks. He is on the
           verge of panic; a man heading toward his own execution,
           he begins to struggle and fight.
           A rope goes around Solomon's neck, then is tossed over
           the branch of the tree. The trio begin to hoist Solomon.
           He gasps and gags as spittle flies from his mouth and the
           life is choked from him.
           With suddenness, Chapin comes from the house brandishing
           a pistol in each hand - Colt Paterson .36 caliber
           "Holster" pistols with 9" barrels. Chapin moves with
           determination toward the lynch mob. He is sharp and
           matter of fact. With the guns in hand, he really doesn't
           need to be much more demonstrative.

           Gentlemen... Whoever moves that
           nigger another foot from where he
           stands is a dead man. I am

           years, and in the absence of
           William Ford, my duty is to
           protect his interests. Ford holds
           a mortgage on Platt of four
           hundred dollars. If you hang him,
           he loses his debt. Until that is

           Ramsay and Cook don't need to be told twice. The pistols
           Chapin's gripping make the situation real clear. Without
           further word, they mount their horses and ride away.
           Tibeats remains, and his anger with him.

           Tibeats mounts up and departs. There is a surreal moment
           as Chapin's not sure what to do about Solomon. He
           chooses to do nothing. Solomon is left dangling by the
           neck from the tree as Chapin calls to Sam in the

           HOURS HAVE PASSED. The sun is now at its apex. The sight
           and smell of the red rose bush is more than vivid as
           Solomon remains tied and dangling exactly where he was
           left. The scene is both tranquil and horrific. Life on
           the plantation continues. The OTHER SLAVES work in the
           field. CHILDREN make their way playfully in the yard.
           It should all underscore the fact that a black, hanging
           even partially from a tree, is nothing unusual in this
           time and space.

           Chapin walks back and forth with the pistols in his
           hands. Clearly he fears Tibeats returning with more and
           better assistance. And yet, he does nothing to alleviate
           Solomon's suffering. He heeds Tibeats words, and as
           though caught up in the middle of nothing more than a
           property dispute, he offers no further aid.
           Solomon's head lolls to one side. He looks toward the
           sun. The bright light flares off the leaves and branches
           of the tree from which Solomon hangs. The glare in
           Solomon's eyes offering him more pain than solace, but he
           cannot help but look upward. As he does, his eyes
           flutter between life and lifelessness...

           very well expire before the day is over.

           is in the foyer of the Ford house. As he gets his
           bearings, he looks around the interior. THE SPACE IS
           HANDSOME, AND WELL DECORATED. It is sharp contrast to
           the bleak surroundings, shacks and dungeons Solomon has
           largely been accustom to during his time of slavery. It
           will be the "first and last time such a sumptuous resting

           Epps reads the Bible to his slaves, eight of them
           altogether. ABRAM; a tall, older slave of about sixty
           years. WILEY, who is forty eight. PHEBE, who is married
           to Wiley. BOB and HENRY who are Phebe's children, EDWARD
           and PATSEY. Patsey is young, just 23 years old...though
           in the era, 23 not as young as in the present day. She
           is the offspring of a "Guinea nigger," brought over to
           Cuba in a slave ship. She nearly brims with unconversant
           sexuality.
           MISTRESS EPPS, Epps's wife, is also present. She sits
           with, holds quite lovingly, some SLAVE CHILDREN. WITH
           THEM SHE IS VERY "MOTHERLY." We also see Epps's overseer
           TREACH. Treach constantly sports a LOADED PISTOL.

           presents a visual purity, like an immaculate expanse of

           seven feet high, each stalk having a great many branches

           sack around their necks that hangs to the ground, the
           mouth of the sack about breast high. Baskets are placed
           at the end of the furrows. Slaves dump their sacks of
           cotton in the baskets, then pick until their sacks are
           again filled.

           the ashes are scraped off. Bacon is fried. As the

           Despite the lateness of the hour, the slaves are up and
           now fully dressed. They take up position in the middle
           of the floor. They wait, poised like actors. Solomon

           the slaves dance. They do so very wearily. The whole of

           Patsey. It should be quite clear that his primary
           motivation for holding dances is so that he may view
           Patsey twirl about the floor.
           This fact is not lost on Mistress Epps. A few moments of
           Epps's lust on display is all that the Mistress can bear.
           Jealousy mounting, she snatches up a CARAFE. With all
           her might she throws it at Patsey. It hits Patsey square
           in the face. TOO THICK TO SHATTER, IT LEAVES HER BLOODY
           AND WRITHING ON THE FLOOR. The dancing, the music stop.
           The slaves, however, react as though it is not the first

           Solomon walks along a well-worn path, shopping bag draped 
           over one shoulder. We see his feet. As the walk slowly 
           gathers pace, Solomon suddenly turns left into dense 
           foliage. His tread is now a full blown sprint, trees 
           flash past as Solomon attacks his way through the woods. 
           The sound of branches cracking underneath. His feet, 
           heartbeat and breath almost deafening. He is desperate. 
           The violence of his advance abruptly stops, there is 
           silence. We see in a clearance a posse of patrollers, 
           preparing for a lynching of two young men. Solomon's 
           eyes meet theirs. The two men look back at Solomon with 
           a look of fear as one of the patrollers checks the noose 
           around their neck. Suddenly the bloodhounds start 
           barking and the patrollers turn in the direction of 
           Solomon. Solomon's whole body shakes with anticipation.

           Sitting on the Grand house's Piazza, Patsey is having tea
           with MISTRESS HARRIET SHAW, WHO IS A BLACK WOMAN. Though
           once a slave, she is now comparatively refined though not
           wholly so. The table where they sit is adorned with
           white linens, and they are attended by a HOUSE NIGGER.
           It makes for a tranquil surreal scene.

           What'n was Epps's concern?

           L'il gossip on the Sabbath be
           fine. All things in moderation.
           Solomon is not sure what to say. He struggles to be as
           diplomatic as possible.

                          SOLOMON
           As you are aware, Master Epps can
           be a man of a hard countenance.
           There are times when it is
           impossible to account for his
           logic. You know he has ill
           feelings toward your husband.

                          MISTRESS SHAW
           He do.

                          SOLOMON
           Master Epps has somehow come to
           believe, as incorrectly as it may
           be, that Master Shaw is... That
           he is something of a lothario and
           an unprincipled man. A misguided
           belief born out of their mutual
           competition as planters, no doubt.

           No doubt...if not born outta truth
           itself.
           The Mistress waves to Shaw. Shaw, unsuspecting of the
           conversation, waves back.

           I'm certain Patsey's well being is
           Master Epps's only concern.

                          MISTRESS SHAW
           Ha! You worry for me? Got no
           cause to worry for my
           sensibilities. I ain't felt the
           end of a lash in 'mo years than I
           cain recall. Ain't worked a
           field, neither. Where one time I
           served, now I got others servin'
           me. The cost to my current
           existence be Massa Shaw
           broadcasting his affections, 'n me
           enjoyin' his pantomime of

           that what it be. A small and
           reasonable price to be paid 'fo
           sure.
           Looking toward Patsey, speaking with great empathy:

           MISTRESS SHAW (CONT'D)
           I knowed what it like to be the
           object of Massa's predilections
           and peculiarities. And I knowed
           they can get expressed with
           kindness or wit violence. A lusty
           visit in the night, or a
           visitation from the whip. And wit
           my experience, if'n I can give
           comfort, then comfort I give. And
           you take comfort, Patsey; the Good
           Lord will manage Epps. In His own
           time the Good Lord will manage dem
           all. Yes, Lordy, there's a day
           comin' that will burn as an oven.
           It comin' as sure as the Lord is
           just. When His will be done...the
           curse on the Pharos is a poor
           example of all that wait 'fo the
           plantation class.
           Mistress Shaw turns her head to the side, catching a
           slave's attention. As she does so, the slave, a YOUNG
           WOMAN, commences to pour tea.
           As if to punctuate her thought, the Mistress takes a sip
           of her tea.

           speedily as he can, which isn't very speedily at all.
           And quickly he tires. Epps is forced to bend over and
           suck air. Solomon maintains his distance, barely
           breathing hard. His breath returned to him, Epps starts
           up the chase again. Solomon runs on out of reach.
           Shortly, Epps again stops, gets his breath... And now in
           what should be quite comical, Epps again runs after
           Solomon. Again, Epps's vigor leaves him before he can
           even get close to the slave.

           Solomon on until he is again out of breath and once more
           drops down. And again offering a treaty:

           I'm all done in, Platt. I have

           but in the name of valor, help yer
           master to his feet.
           Solomon cautiously moves closer to help. Again he is
           attacked by Epps - this time by knife. Sort of. Epps is
           too drunk and tired to fully open the folding blade - and
           chased far around the field by Epps. ALL OF THE

           With the sun yet again high in the sky the slaves are
           working the field picking cotton. As before THEY SING A
           SPIRITUAL, the only thing that distracts them from the
           tedium at hand.
           But there is no distracting from the heat. We see Henry
           begin to falter before it... And eventually collapse
           right in the dirt. Though the other slaves take note,
           none move to help him. None dare.
           From Treach rather matter of factly:

                          TREACH

           Go'won. Git up.
           Unsteadily, Henry lifts himself and goes back to picking
           cotton. He joins in again with the spiritual, as if the
           song is all that can keep him going.

           come looking for. This time there is no escaping it. As

           On top of a wood pile, in the back of the smoke house -
           Epps shoves Patsey. He stops, stands as if gathering his
           manhood, then he's all over Patsey. He is rough and
           clumsy. It looks like something between an awkward rape
           and a virgin attempting his first sexual encounter.
           Patsey does not respond in any way other than to
           continually turn her head from Epps, but otherwise remain
           as still as possible. If there is such a thing, she is
           vicious with her passive aggressiveness.
           Epps's frustration mounts until - as the Mistress Shaw
           had cautioned - he crosses the line from passion to
           violence. He begins slapping Patsey to get a response
           from her. When that fails, he punches her which only
           leads to him taking up his whip and lashing Patsey
           MERCILESSLY. Still, she gives him nothing. Beaten,
           Patsey sits in the dirt among the cotton, Epps deep
           breathing above her. The desire for sex now having left
           him.
           Epps heads from the field. Patsey is left where she is.

           He carries with him a sack filled with the goods from the
           store. As he walks, SOLOMON LOOKS AROUND CASUALLY. When
           he is certain he is alone, he sets down the sack, opens
           it and appropriates A SINGLE SHEET OF THE PAPER which he

           acts as though he's hiding away found gold. In reality
           it's more than that. For Solomon the paper is a first

           his fiddle, to playing it as the slaves are again made to
           dance.
           Mistress Epps brings out a tray of freshly baked

           The slaves, thankful for the rest as much as the food,
           file toward the tray reciting a chorus of "Thank you,

           Slaves are crammed into the shack - LITERALLY ON TOP OF

           up. Packed in like cattle, there is barely room to move
           let alone draw a deep, clean breath. There is a real

           Among them is Solomon who must believe at this point that
           his life has reached its very lowest point. The odds of
           survival are slight, let alone the chance of actually
           ever returning to his family. This clearly weighs on him
           as he struggles to find anything like comfortable space

           ABOUT THIRTY SLAVES are working the field. They are
           divided into THREE GANGS. The first which draw the cane,
           the next lay the cane in the drill, the last then hoe the
           rows after.
           Solomon is among a gang that draws and cuts, and he moves
           with speed and skill. Certainly more so than he
           displayed picking cotton.
           Standing with his overseer, Judge Turner watches.

           As he tries to rest - sleep is nearly impossible -
           Solomon finds himself face to face with a woman, ANNA.
           She is awake. For a few beats she avoids eye contact
           with Solomon. She seems, like Solomon, to be
           unaccustomed to her surroundings and horribly frightened
           by them. Eventually her eyes meet Solomon's. She makes
           no sound, but great apprehension spills from her eyes.
           Whatever's next, whatever horror awaits, she can barely
           stand to face. Fear, proximity... They drive her hand

           SOLOMON'S HAND AND PRESSES IT TO HER BREAST. Solomon
           tries to jerk his hand away, but ANNA HOLDS IT IN PLACE.
           Manipulating Solomon's hand, she begins to massage her
           breast. Solomon takes no real pleasure in the act -
           really, neither does Anna. THERE SHOULD BE A TRUE SENSE

           ANNA IS JUST SO VERY, VERY DESPERATE FOR HUMAN CONTACT,

           FOR THE NEED TO FEEL ALIVE AND LIKE A PERSON RATHER THAN

           AN ANIMAL THAT EMOTIONALLY SHE IS WILLING TO ENGAGE

           SOLOMON.
           The need quickly compounds. Anna presses her lips to
           Solomon's. Eventually, SHE DIRECTS HIS HAND BENEATH HER
           DRESS AND BETWEEN HER LEGS. Solomon, with slightly more
           compassion than a guy making union wages, BEGINS TO
           MANIPULATE ANNA WITH HIS HAND. The act remains more
           perfunctory than passionate.
           We can see Anna moving toward climax and eventual
           release. But more - or substantially less - than joyous
           sex, it is really just a drug-like inoculation against
           reality. But the feeling quickly fades. All that
           remains, as with most chance encounters, is regret.
           And there is shame, too. This is put on display as Anna
           turns away from Solomon. As quickly as it began, it is
           as though the act had not happened at all.

           The berry juice, too free-flowing, is unusable as ink.

           just slaves. A fact confirmed when they step menacingly
           toward Solomon, ONE WITH A SHIV IN HAND.

           -FEBRUARY/MARCH, 1847-
           Alone out on the edge of the Bayou, Solomon is playing a
           low air on his violin WHILE SNACKING ON SCRAPS OF BACON.
           As he plays, something appears in the distance. From the
           edge of the bayou, coming forth like an apparition arisen
           from the earth, is CELESTE. She is a young woman of
           about 19 years of age and far whiter than most blacks.

           "IT REQUIRED CLOSE INSPECTION TO DISTINGUISH IN HER
           FEATURE THE SLIGHTEST TRACE OF AFRICAN BLOOD." Beyond
           that, she is pale and haggard, but still lovely.
           Dressed in a white gown, she emerges from the water.
           Draped on her dress, her period. A line in her skirt.
           It's very visible, but not shocking. A ribbon of red in
           her dress.
           Celeste moves to Solomon without fear or hesitation. As
           Solomon, startled, takes her in, Celeste says quite

                          PLAINLY:

                          CELESTE
           I am hungry. Give me food.

                          CELESTE
           I'm hungry.
           Solomon gives Celeste some of his food. Celeste,
           famished, devours it.

                          SOLOMON
           What is your name?

           dem and Celeste, and dey won't
           mind the devilish orders of the
           overseer.
           Celeste lifts her head from the food on which she gnaws.

                          CELESTE (CONT'D)
           Do you believe me?

                          SOLOMON
           Yes.

           Why?

                          SOLOMON
           There are some whose tracks the
           hounds will refuse to follow.

           Give me more food. I'm starvin'.

           Almost as if compelled, Solomon does as ordered. As she
           eats, Celeste aggrandizes herself:

                          CELESTE (CONT'D)
           Most slaves escape at night. The
           overseers are alert for such
           chicanes. But Celeste tricked dem
           'n alight in the middle of the day
           wit the sun up at its highest.
           The place of my concealment now
           deep in the swamp, not half a mile
           from Massa's plantation, and a
           world apart. A world a tall

           always in Celeste's world, even in
           the brightest day. I will live
           there, and I will live freely.
           The overseers are a cowardly lot.
           Dey will not go where their dogs
           show fear and where it always be
           night. Others will join me in the

           Solomon stealthfully makes his way into the storage shed.
           Dried and smoked meats are hung, and milled corn is
           about. Taking out a handkerchief, Solomon begins to load
           it with food. Not too much. Not so much his thievery
           will be readily noticed, but he does avail himself.

           Solomon plays his violin, but plays it with an anxious
           nature as he waits.
           Then, as before, a figure appears in the distance. It is
           Celeste coming out of the night. She makes her way
           directly to Solomon. With no greeting, she says:

                          CELESTE
           I am hungry.
           Solomon gives Celeste the handkerchief he's filled. She
           opens it, and begins to devour the food. As she eats:

           reaches first muddy ground, then firm footing. Hauling
           himself onto the swamps edge, Solomon finally collapses
           in a drenched, worn heap. His life spared, but Celeste
           never to be seen again.

           -MAY/JUNE, 1847-
           We come up now outside of Master Epps's plantation. Epps
           stands in the drive. He's in surprisingly good spirits
           as Solomon, Uncle Abram, Henry and Bob trudge their way
           wearily toward Epps and his other slaves who are
           gathered.
           The cotton field is in full bloom, the crop fully
           returned.

           Joyous! Joyous indeed!
           Throughout Epps's welcome, Solomon's focus is on Patsey
           who is lined up with the other slaves. SHE IS NOW MORE
           HAGGARD THAN WHEN WE LAST SAW HER. Her face and arms
           display many new scars. It's clear that in the
           intervening years she has quite literally been a whipping
           boy for Epps and the Mistress.

           The slaves are out working on the field. White hands
           appear, picking cotton: ARMSBY. He is wholly unskilled at
           picking cotton, and he puts little effort into the job.
           As we meet him he seems a decent sort if a little short
           on self-motivation. In anachronistic terminology, he'd
           be called a "slacker." He joins in with the slaves,

           Virginia, down into Alabama. I
           could manage easy a hundred slaves

           his own self. Takes him to a

           Solomon and the slaves pick cotton. Armsby is
           conspicuously NOT laboring in the field. As Solomon
           works he is watched by Epps. Watched more than he
           normally is. For a moment it seems it might just be a
           matter of perspective; Solomon's unease over his actions.
           But soon Epps is joined by Armsby. The two men stand and
           talk, their looks locked toward Solomon.
           Whatever it is that is occurring between them continues
           for a long, long moment. But Epps makes no move toward
           Solomon. Solomon continues with his work.

           The slaves are at rest. Gripping his whip Epps enters,
           without so much as a knock at the door. For a moment
           there's curiosity; is he there for a dance, for
           Patsey...?

           Solomon comes out into the dark. Nearly hidden in the
           shadows is a bitter Epps. Despite the lack of light,
           Epps's malevolence is quite clear. His whip attached to
           his hip. As he speaks, he stokes himself with swigs from
           a FLASK.
           Epps puts his arm around Solomon, as if consoling a
           friend, and guides him into the woods.

           whip Patsey. Her back welts, then tears... Patsey
           screams in agony. Solomon strikes again and again...
           After a full thirty lashes Solomon looks to Epps, who is
           not satisfied.

           promised, Patsey's back has been reduced to LITTLE MORE

           painfully loud and angry curses of Epps load the air.
           Patsey by now is terribly lacerated, literally flayed.
           The lash wet with blood which flowed down her sides and
           dropped upon the ground. At length Patsey ceases
           struggling. Her head sinks listlessly on the ground.

           Bass looks at Solomon, holding his gaze for more than a
           prolonged beat.

           My daughter Margaret is possibly
           now 19 and my son Alonzo, 16. I
           miss them so. It would be an
           unspeakable happiness to clasp my
           wife and my family again.
           Bass hands Solomon an end of a long plank of wood and
           looks over his shoulder, as if to camouflage the
           conversation by work. They both lift it toward the
           floorboards. Finally Bass speaks.

           I have always forgone
           relationships and family. I did
           once have a sweetheart who I loved
           deeply.

           immediately hands over.

           But that was a long, long time
           ago. I've been traveling this
           country for the best part of
           twenty years. My freedom is
           everything. The fact that I can
           walk out of here tomorrow gives me
           most pleasure. I see the aching in
           your eyes, the pain of not being
           attached to your loved ones. My
           life doesn't mean much to anyone,

           to a lot of people. What you have
           just said to me scares me, and I
           must say, sir, I am afraid. Not
           just for you, but for me.
           They continue working, fixing the floorboards in unison.
           Solomon, slightly confused.

           We pull back to reveal the two men dwarfed by the

                          SLOW DISSOLVE
           To a now virtually complete, half-painted white gazebo.
           Slaves continue to work on it. As they do so, Bass peels
           away from the structure to have an overview. He beckons
           Solomon toward him, out of earshot from the slaves who
           are continuing to work on the gazebo. As Solomon
           approaches, Bass shouts-

           And bring those markers!
           Solomon gathers a clutch of markers in his hands and

           each other's eyes, we should be able to easily see how
           greatly Bass wanted to be able to help Solomon. Equally,
           we can see the depth of regard Solomon has for Bass. The
           moment is made all the more powerful by the fact neither
           man can openly speak his regret or thanks. A moment
           longer, and then Bass releases his grip and makes his
           way marching toward the gazebo, pointing instructions.
           Solomon is left, markers in hand, alone.

           Solomon sits on a secluded part of the road, fiddle in
           hand. He stares across the expanse. His eyes fixed on
           something that is a million miles away.
           Slowly Solomon tunes his fiddle, turning the tuning peg
           tighter and tighter. As the strings are taut, the sound
           is almost unbearable as Solomon tightens bit by bit, as
           if bones are being cracked one by one. Just beyond the
           breaking point of sound, there is a snap.
           He then repeats the action.
           Solomon holds the neck of the violin. Sliding his thumb
           and forefinger down the neck, he methodically cracks it
           at the base. He carefully snaps the neck and removes it
           from the body, then snaps it in two, placing it on the
           ground.
           He then starts on the body. Heaving it on the ground, it
           falls apart. Methodically he breaks the violin into small
           bits - silencing the instrument with a hushed display of
           violence, rather than aggressive. Seems almost to be, in
           an odd way, respectful.

                          PATSEY
           Platt...
           Disregarding Parker, Solomon crosses over to Patsey.
           Under the circumstances, neither really knows how to
           engage. Finally, suddenly, Patsey throws her arms around
           Solomon and they embrace.
           Epps, now mounted on his horse, witness the encounter.
           Kicking the stirrups hard into the sides of the horse, he
           rides off furiously.
           Calling from the carriage, mindful of Epps:

                          PARKER
           Solomon...if we know what's wise,
           we should depart.
           A moment longer Solomon and Patsey hold each other. They
           separate, Solomon heading back to the carriage. He and
           Parker alight. The Sheriff chides the horses and they

           start up. As they move on, Patsey sinks down to the
           ground, where she remains in a weary and half-reclining
           state, the other slaves around her.
           WE STAY WITH Solomon as he travels further and further
           from the slaves - who are diminished by distance.
           Solomon waves a hand to them, but the carriage rounds a
           bend and a thicket of trees hides them from his eyes
           forever more.

           -MARCH, 1853-
           We now see Solomon in front of a door. A door we have
           seen before at the very beginning of our story. Solomon,
           aged significantly since then, stands nervously,
           swallowing, and adjusting his attire. He breaths in and
           holds his breath. He blows out and closes his eyes. A
           tear falls from his cheek, but this is not the way he
           wants his family to see him. He gathers himself, and
           looks to his right. There stands Mr. Parker. He places
           his hand on Solomon's shoulder. He says gently-

                          PARKER
           Are you ready?
           Solomon swallows and nods.

           INT. NORTHUP HOUSE - LATER

           THE DOOR TO THE ROOM OPENS. Mr. Parker enters, Solomon
           behind. We first see Anne, in her finest attire; the
           Northup children: Alonzo, who is now seventeen and
           Margaret who is now twenty - SHE CARRIES WITH HER A
           BUNDLE. Also present is MARGARET'S HUSBAND. The family
           waits patiently, dutifully...but anxiously.
           Anne rises to greet him, but holds back. All around, the
           body language of the family is stiff and awkward. They
           are, after all - after twelve years - little more than
           familiar strangers.

                          SOLOMON
           I apologize for my appearance. I
           have had a difficult time of
           things these past many years.
           Solomon looks among his family; trying to recall them as
           much as they look to see familiarity within him. To his

           Margaret, tearing, hugs her father. Solomon almost
           breaks, but he keeps himself together. Looking to the

           Margaret rises, she presents her bundle to her father.

           The fact his grandson carries his name, is overwhelming.
           Solomon breaks down. Emotionally, physically... But
           ANNE IS THERE TO CATCH HIM. As she holds him, Solomon
           says to Anne with all his heart:

           Forgive me.

                          ANNE
           There is nothing to forgive.
           The pair, joined now by the whole family, hold on to each
           other for life...and one would think for all the rest of
           their lives.

           eventually dismissed.
           Northup spent the rest of his life working as an
           abolitionist, and with the Underground Railroad.
           Solomon Northup most likely died between 1863 and 1875.
           The exact date, place, and circumstances of his death
           remain unknown.
