          It's.coming, coming, COMING. Desperate, McClane sees that part

          into levering the rifle against the steel.
          Slowly, slowly, sweat breaking out on his forehead, he levers the
          rifle higher and higher, the rifle in turn levering the grid
          upward, an inch at a time finally, it's high enough for him to
          JAM the rifle's bayonet ring into the grid while the cheek notch
          of the stock perches precariously on the lip of the hole.
