1   EXT.   NIGHT.   HOUSING PROJECTS -- MOSCOW                    1

    SMASH CUT

    MOTION -- flat out -- it's us -- we're running -- stumbling
    -- breathing rushed -- blood in the snow...

    We are JASON BOURNE and we're running down an alley...

    Supered below:   MOSCOW

    BLUE LIGHTS -- from the distance -- strobing through the
    night -- rushing toward us -- POLICE CARS -- three of them -
    - SIRENS HOWLING as they bear down -- closer -- faster --
    until they whip past the alley...

    Up against the wall -- BOURNE is hidden in the shadows.

    BOURNE is badly wounded -- shot through the shoulder --
    bruises and broken bones from the final car chase in
    SUPREMACY...

    With a GROAN, he lifts himself up, staggers across a park
    toward a PHARMACY...


4   INT. NIGHT. PHARMACY -- MOSCOW                                4

    ROWS of MEDICINE and FIRST AID supplies, and in the
    background, a DOOR being jimmied...It's BOURNE...The ALARM
    goes off...

    MACRO ON -- MEDICINE BOTTLE

    VICODIN, as BOURNE grabs it...Then PENICILLIN...

    Then SURGICAL SUPPLIES:

    Scalpel...Forceps...Sutures...Cotton gauze...Betadine...

    BOURNE finds a large sink...Rests his gun there...Lays out
    SURGICAL SUPPLIES...Checks out his back in the
    mirror...Opens the capsules of penicillin and pours the
    powder directly into the wound...Begins treating himself...


5   EXT. NIGHT. PHARMACY -- MOSCOW                                5

    A POLICE CAR pulls up to the curb, lights flashing. One
    POLICEMAN goes to the jimmied DOOR. SECOND POLICEMAN sees
    blood and footprints. He motions to his partner to
    follow...


6   INT. NIGHT. PHARMACY BATHROOM -- MOSCOW                       6

    BOURNE finishing up -- splashes water on his face -- he
    seems a man on a mission. He looks up --

                                                                 2


       A MIRROR.

       His face...

                   Welcome to the program...

       POV Bourne walks down a corridor (corridor #1).


6AA    INT. NIGHT PHARMACY -- MOSCOW                                  6AA

       The cops approaching.

       Daniels leading Bourne down the corridor.

                             DISEMBODIED VOICE (V.O.)
                   You'll be saving American lives.

       A black sack is thrown over Bourne's head, then:

       (STOCK) A torrent of quick shots of Bourne's kills: the
       Professor, Jarda, the blonde guy in Paris, Mr. And Mrs.
       Neski...

       And finally. BANG -- Marie hit in the head.      The car off
       the bridge. She sinks away dead...


6A     INT.   NIGHT   PHARMACY -- MOSCOW                              6A

       The POLICE enter the back room, guns drawn.

                             POLICEMAN #1
                   Put your hands on your head and
                   turn around slowly!

       BOURNE snaps out of it, doesn't move. POLICEMAN #1 (older)
       approaches him. When BOURNE doesn't respond to his
       questions, the POLICEMAN starts forward. BOURNE turns and
       in one motion grabs his gun from the sink and disables the
       POLICEMAN.

       BOURNE freezes POLICEMAN #2 with his gun and a look.

                             BOURNE
                        (in Russian)
                   Give me your gun and radio.

       POLICEMAN #2's gun and radio skittle across the floor.

                                                              3


                           BOURNE
                     (in Russian)
                 My argument is not with you.

     BOURNE smashes the radio and takes the gun.

     BOURNE exits...

8C   INT. CIA -- DAY                                              8C

     A workman installs a nameplate that reads:    Ezra Kramer,
     Director, CIA.


8C   INT. KRAMER'S OFFICE -- DAY                                  8C

     Kramer listens to a recording with Landy and Cronin. There
     are unhung pictures and a few other items that indicate he
     has just moved into this job.

                                                          4


Two other senior CIA officials sit in on the meeting.
Kramer looks at a file on Bourne and Abbott.

                    BOURNE (V.O.)
          So we got in the way?   Is that
          why Neski died? Is that why you
          killed Marie?

Kramer glances at a photo of Marie in the file.

                    ABBOTT (V.O.)
          You killed Marie the minute you
          climbed into her car.   The
          minute you entered her life she
          was dead!

Kramer looks at Abbott's official photo.

                    BOURNE (V.O.)
          I told you people to leave me
          alone! I fell off the grid. I
          was half way around the world.

                    ABBOTT (V.O.)
          There's no place it won't catch
          up to you. It's how every story
          ends. It's what you are, Jason.
          A killer! You always will be.

THUMP!

                    CRONIN
          We think that's Bourne hitting
          him on the head and then--

He makes a gun with his hand, i.e. Bourne putting his gun
to Abbott's head.

                       ABBOTT (V.O.)
          Go ahead!     Go on! Do it!

                    BOURNE (V.O.)
          She wouldn't want me to. That's
          the only reason your alive.

The tape clicks off.

                    KRAMER
          Who's "she?"

CRONIN puts a picture of MARIE in front of KRAMER.

                    LANDY
          His girlfriend, Marie. She was
          killed in India three weeks ago.

Kramer looks down at another image.     Abbott dead after his
suicide.

                                                        5


                    KRAMER
          A dirty section chief in league
          with a corrupt Russian
          Billionaire commits suicide when
          confronted by Jason Bourne. You
          couldn't make this stuff up.
              (holds up the photo of
               Abbot dead)
          You watched this happen?

Landy nods.   Kramer shakes his head in disgust at the whole
situation.

                    KRAMER
          Bourne's last confirmed location
          is Moscow, three days ago?

                       LANDY
          Right.

                    KRAMER
          So what does he do now?

                    LANDY
          I think he's looking for
          something he hasn't found.

                       KRAMER
          Like what?     What's he after?

                     LANDY
          I'm not sure. Maybe he hasn't
          gotten his memory back yet.  Not
          all of it.

A look from Kramer...

                    KRAMER
          Pam, what I need to know is, what
          kind of a threat is he to us?

                    LANDY
          If he just wanted to hurt us he
          could have sent this tape to CNN.

                    KRAMER
          Maybe he still will. Maybe he
          gave it to you because he wants
          to throw you in the opposite
          direction of his real plan. I
          don't know. I just know my
          number one rule is "the only way
          to stay safe is to assume the
          worst."   As far as I'm concerned
          Bourne is a serious threat until
          proven otherwise.

       ROSS interviews DANIELS, a TAPE RECORDER on the table
       between them. ROSS shows DANIELS some of the evidence he's
       assembled...WANTED POSTERS of JASON BOURNE.

                                ROSS
                         (with poster)
                     ...This one's three years ago --
                     had half of Interpol after him --
                     disappeared...Turned up in Naples
                     -- Berlin -- Moscow --
                     disappeared again...
                         (Daniels says nothing)
                     The girl he was on he run with --
                     Marie Kreutz -- she turned up
                     dead halfway around the world,
                     from a sniper's bullet...
                         (beat)
                     What connects the dots? Is it
                     Treadstone?

                     Turn off that tape recorder.

24     INT. DAY. MARTIN'S APARTMENT -- PARIS                       24

       The charm of old Paris captured in the workings of an
       elevator operating in a wrought-iron shaft...

                                                          7


A WORK TABLE, covered with sheet music, music paper,
pencils. And, sitting on the upright piano against the
wall, a framed PHOTO of MARIE...

A KNOCK on a door beautifully, heavily lacquered with
centuries of paint...

MARTIN KREUTZ, late 20s, opens the door and finds BOURNE. A
long look between them -- like two lost brothers who
recognize each other -- each has been waiting for this
moment for a long time.


INT. CONTINUOUS. MARTIN'S APARTMENT

Martin looks out the window.

                    MARTIN
          Where is my sister?

                    BOURNE
          She's dead. She was killed.

                    MARTIN
          I knew it was going to end this
          way. It was always going to end
          this way...

                    BOURNE
          I didn't believe that.

                    MARTIN
          Why did she die?

                    BOURNE
          She was shot. A man came for me.

                    MARTIN
          And then you killed him.

Bourne nods.

                      MARTIN
          Now what?

                    BOURNE
          Someone started all this...and
          I'm going to find them.

Bourne looks at him for a beat and leaves.


EXT. SUBWAY -- DAY

Bourne climbs the stairs.

Bourne rounds a corner and stops, sees a bodyguard at a
door up the street hail a car then go back inside.

                                                            8


     Bourne walks up to the door, the bodyguard comes out again.
     Bourne knocks him aside. Grabs the man behind him,
     ELLATRACHE.

                          BOURNE
                    (in French)
                Who started Treadstone?

     The bodyguard comes back, gun out--

                           ELLATRACHE
                    (in French, to
                      bodyguard)
                It's OK!
                    (in French, to Bourne)
                They're still looking for you.
                You are taking a big risk coming
                here.

     Bourne shoves him against the wall, hard.

                          BOURNE
                    (in French)
                Just tell me what I want to know!

                          ELLATRACHE
                    (in French)
                I just provided them weapons.    I
                don't know who started--

                          BOURNE
                    (in French)
                You know something.   Tell me
                where to start looking.

                          ELLATRACHE
                    (in French)
                There's a journalist in London.
                Simon Ross. He seems to know a
                lot about you.   He has a source
                inside the program. Someone
                there from the beginning. What
                should I tell them if they
                contact me?

                          BOURNE
                    (in English)
                They give me the name I want, or
                I burn their entire house down to
                get it.


16   EXT.   DAY. HEATHROW AIRPORT -- LONDON                     16

     ROSS hurries to catch a TAXI as he talks on his cell phone.

                                                             9


                               ROSS
                    ...This is big -- a skein of lies

      As VOSEN steps out of the elevator and into his office, he
      is met by his #2, WILLS.

                               WILLS
                    We tracked the phone. Registered
                    to a London reporter named Simon
                    Ross. He works at the Guardian
                    newspaper.

                                                            10


      They enter a hallway through double doors towards the HUB.

                          VOSEN
                You tracking him?

      As they pass through, colleague hands WILLS a file.

                          WILLS
                Yeah, thanks Mike. We have a
                survey team covering him at
                work...and a sneak and peek's on
                their way to his apartment.

                          VOSEN
                Well, who talked to him? How did
                he find out about Blackbriar?

                          WILLS
                We don't know, we pulled his
                background and ran a cross check
                on any known anomalies, but we've
                come up with nothing. But, I
                think if we follow Ross, we are
                going to be able...

                         VOSEN
                Right. Ross is easy. I want the
                source.

                  I want rendition protocols and I
                  want the asset put on standby,
                  just in case.

                  one.

      ROSS'S information come up on the center screen.

                  Our target is a British national,
                  Simon Ross, a reporter. I want
                  all his phones, his blackberry,
                  his apartment, his car, bank
                  accounts, credit cards, travel
                  patterns...I want to know what
                  he's going to think before he
                  does. Every dirty little secret
                  he has. And most of all, we want
                  the name and real time location
                  of his source.


                  This is NSA priority level 4, any
                  questions?

                  All right, let's get to it.

      BOURNE reads The Guardian. He sees an article written by
      Simon Ross.   Title: "RENEGADE ASSASSIN LOSE IN EUROPE".
      It mentions BOURNE. There is a photo of Marie--

      Marie smiles at him. Marie shot. Marie fades into the
      depths, dead. Bourne burns Marie's stuff


26D   INT. DAY. EUROSTAR                                           26D

      the pain of her loss

      Bourne finds Ross's name on the masthead, then goes to the
      name just below it in the news department.

                           EDITOR

                           ROSS
                 Blackbriar.

                           REPORTER
                 Sorry, a call for you.

                 Why aren't we hearing this?

                           WILLS
                 That's a hard line, Jimmy, why
                 don't we have it?

                            JIMMY
                 We have his line, sir, but he's
                 not on it.

                Sir, subject just arrived at the

      ROSS moves to the entrance.

      Behind him, inside the tube station portico, BOURNE
      arrives.

      Sees ROSS. Sees the two survey teams. MOBILE ONE up the
      stair well and MOBILE TWO at street level.

      Commuters coming up the escalators. BOURNE joins them -
      moving towards Ross.

      Closer.

      Right on him.   ROSS oblivious.   Looking out onto the
      street.

      BOURNE brushes past him and PUTS THE PHONE IN HIS POCKET..

      ROSS feels the contact. Checking himself -- he's okay.
      But now a phone is ringing -- looks around, must be someone
      else.

      But the vibration's coming from his jacket pocket.

      ROSS takes out the phone -- not his -- puzzled.

      ROSS hits "answer."

                                                            17

                Why do you know so much about me?

                           ROSS
                What?

                          BOURNE
                The article. You talked to
                someone from Treadstone. Someone
                there at the beginning.  What's
                his name?

                          ROSS
                I can't tell you that.... Who's
                following me?

                          BOURNE
                Whoever they are it's trouble.

                          ROSS
                Are they Blackbriar?

                          BOURNE
                Blackbriar, what's Blackbriar?

                          ROSS
                I don't know. I heard the name
                this morning for the first time.
                Whatever it is, my source said it
                started with you.

                                                                22


                          BOURNE
                 What? What are you talking
                 about?

                           ROSS
                 Look, just help me get away from
                 these people...and we can talk
                 more...we can--

       ROSS moving fast. Fighting through the crowds of faces.
       Each one a killer in ROSS' tormented mind.

       BOURNE on the periphery looking out across the throng,
       picking out the inconsistencies.

      ROSS spinning round. Dipping left.   BLACK TOP passing in
      the background missing him.

      BOURNE crossing close behind - marshalling the pieces at

                  Change of plan. Stop. Tie your
                  shoelace.

      BOURNE seeing ROSS dip out of view as a group of TOURISTS
      block the CCTV's line of sight.

                  Clear. News kiosk. Straight
                  ahead.

      ROSS on the move. Sweating. Paranoid.

      Seeing a BIN MAN coming toward him -- reaching into his
      trolley.

                            BOURNE
                Negative.

                          ROSS
                He's got a gun.

                            BOURNE
                Negative.    Keep straight ahead.

      But ROSS swerves out of his path as the BIN MAN pulls out --
      a bunch of keys.

      CCTV CAMERAS turn -- ZOOMING IN ON ROSS.

                                                               26


       Suddenly -- CLICK -- PLATFORM 7 displays.

       A wave of commuters flooding away -- sweeping the AGENTS
       back with them towards platform 7.

                           BOURNE (CONT'D)
                 GET IN THE STORE.

       BOURNE'S bought them thirty seconds.


100    INT. TUNNELS ABOVE THE CONCOURSE -- DAY                      100

       PAZ on the move. Earpiece crackling. Through a door. Taking
       a left down another tunnel.

       Opens another security door and moves up some steps.
       Towards a ladder.


100A   EXT. CONCOURSE WATERLOO -- SIMULTANEOUSLY -- DAY           100A

       The AGENTS regrouping. Speaking into their radios.

                           Voice
                 He's in the store -- still moving
                 east.

       ROSS out into the open again. In front of him another STORE
       COMPLEX.

                           BOURNE
                 INSIDE!

       BOURNE searching the concourse. Something bothering him.
       The threat level clicking another notch.


102A/B INT. MAINTENANCE AREA-- SIMULTANEOUSLY -- DAY           102A/B

       PAZ heads up some stairs to a service platform.

       Climbs a ladder.


101    EXT. CONCOURSE -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY                          101

       ROSS into the store complex. To one side is a service
       doorway.

       BOURNE sees the AGENTS approaching. Looks the other way --
       up at the hoardings above.

       Something's not right. Treadstone instinct.

                           BOURNE
                 Service doorway -- Now!

                                                                27


64H    INT. NEW YORK HUB -- SIMULTANEOUS -- DAY                      64H

       An image of Ross as he enters the store complex appears on
       the screen.

                            TECHY 2
                 Store.   Three means of egress.

                           VOSEN
                 Close him down...


105    INT. STORE COMPLEX -- SIMULTANEOUSLY -- DAY                   105

       ROSS through narrow store corridors. Sheer panic now.
       Two of the AGENTS move in after him.

       BOURNE behind them.

       BANG - takes the first out silently.

                           BOURNE
                 Keep moving.

       ROSS moving out to the light as another AGENT follows.

                           BOURNE (CONT'D)
                 Through the store room.

       ROSS travelling through.   The second AGENT right behind as-

       BOURNE steps out from behind the store room door. The dull
       snap of bones as second AGENT falls to the floor.


64H    INT. DAY -- CRI HUB                                           64H

       On a screen VOSEN watches, transfixed, as BOURNE takes out
       all his agents and then grabs ROBB...

                           VOSEN
                 Jesus Christ, that's Jason
                 Bourne.

                           WILLS
                 Maybe he's the source?

                           VOSEN
                 It doesn't matter, the asset now
                 has 2 targets. Take them both
                 out.

       WILLS taps in the order...


102B   INT. MAINTENANCE AREA-- DAY                               102B

       PAZ moves cross a narrow walkway.

                                                                28


       Now he's behind a mechanical 'tri-panel' hoarding. The kind
       that displays a different advert every 15 seconds. He waits
       for the change and then---

       -- A huge field of vision across the concourse stretching
       out down below him- a sniper's heaven.

       PAZ pulling open the motor-casing from the side panel, goes
       to work on it.

       Slowing the rotation. Rearranging the large triangular
       prisms to give him just the right time-gap to pull the
       trigger- and just enough cover to disappear.

       He takes out rifle parts from his rucksack. Starts to
       assemble them.


102C   INT. BEHIND THRESHERS (BEHIND THE SILVER METAL DOOR)        102C

                              BOURNE
                    I'm going to get you to safety
                    but you have to stay calm do
                    exactly what I say.

                              ROSS
                        (fear-induced autopilot)
                    Sure, okay.

                              BOURNE
                    No, listen to me: Exactly what I
                    say this time. Understand?

       Ross snaps to focus.     Looks Bourne in the eye.

                              ROSS
                    Yes.

                              BOURNE
                    Stay here while I look for an
                    escape.

       Ross nods.


102B   INT. MAINTENANCE AREA                                       102B

       PAZ puts together the rifle.


103    INT. WATERLOO STATION                                         103

       BOURNE exits from the silver door behind Threshers.    He
       stays on the phone with Ross.

       Hidden from the view of the CCTV cameras by the thick
       crowd, Bourne sees the approaching agents abruptly pulling
       back.

                                                                     29


                            ROSS (PHONE V.O.) (CONT'D)
                  I can see the entrance from here
                  I can make it out--

                            BOURNE
                  No, stay behind that door.


64H   INT. HUB                                                            64H

      CCTV view of the silver door behind Threshers that ROSS is
      behind (not Bourne). Wills is on phone.

                            WILLS
                  There. That silver door.
                  Bourne's behind that door?

                               TECH
                  Confirmed.

                            WILLS
                  Okay, pull the agents back and
                  give Bourne's location to the
                  asset.


107   INT. MAINTENANCE AREA                                               107

      On his cell phone Paz receives a text indicating Bourne's
      location. Paz finds the silver door and aims his rifle at
      it.

      SCOPE POV

      A shape barely visible moving behind the window.           (It's
      Ross but Paz and the Hub think it's Bourne.


111   INT. BEHIND THRESHERS /         WATERLOO CONCOURSE-- DAY            111

      INTERCUTTING BETWEEN ROSS AND BOURNE:

      Bourne spots the agents pulling back per Wills' orders.

                            ROSS (INTO PHONE)
                  If I run now I can make it--

                             BOURNE (INTO PHONE
                  No.   Something's not right.


107   INT. MAINTENANCE AREA                                               107

      Paz awaiting his shot--

                                                               30


       SCOPE POV

       The door comes open slightly, but from this angle Paz
       doesn't have a clean shot at his target (who he thinks is
       Bourne).


111    INT. CONCOURSE -- WATERLOO                                   111

       Bourne searches the rafters, looking for any threats from
       above.

                             ROSS (TEL. V.O.)
                   I'm going to go for it, okay?

                             BOURNE
                   Don't move until I tell you.

       Bourne is distracted by the last of the agents
       disappearing. Something is definitely wrong--

                             ROSS
                   I'm going to go for it.

                             BOURNE
                   No, No not now.

       Ross suddenly sprints out from behind the door--


110A   SCOPE POV                                                110A

       Paz sees the shape emerge--


110A   INT. MAINTENANCE AREA -- DAY                             110A

       PAZ fires--


111    INT. WATERLOO -- SERIES OF ANGLES                            111

       But it's Ross, not Bourne. Ross is hit by Paz's shot.    He
       falls, inches from the silver door, dead. Blood has
       splattered on the door.


110A   INT. PAZ'S NEST                                          110A

       Paz snaps his head back to the scope, realizing he's shot
       the wrong person. Then he catches a glimpse of Bourne--

       Bourne ducks behind the gathering crowd, out of Paz's line
       of sight, and goes to the body.

                                                              31

       Vosen and Wills stare at the screen. At the image of Ross,
       dead on the concourse.   The room -- normally full of
       chatter has gone dead silent...

       Vosen puts his head in his hands. This is a monumental
       screw up and everyone here knows it.  He just had the
       wrong man killed....

                            VOSEN
                  Oh...shit...

       Then suddenly Vosen snaps back to focus:

                            VOSEN (CONT'D)
                  Get the asset out of there ...

                            WILLS
                  What about Bourne?

       On the HUB MONITORS we see Police moving in... Vosen
       doesn't need to see anymore.

                            VOSEN
                  Get him out of there - NOW!


111    INT. WATERLOO -- DAY                                        111

       Bourne feels Ross' body for something.

       Paz is frustrated by the order. He's itching to get another
       shot off at Bourne, but after a beat, packs up quickly, as
       ordered.


111    INT. WATERLOO -- DAY                                        111

111A   INT. DAY. WATERLOO STATION                               111A

       On the screens and in real life, the aftermath of the hit.
       PARAMEDICS try helplessly to deal with ROSS -- killed
       instantly by the head shot meant for BOURNE...POLICE arrive
       and seal off the crime scene...

                                                                32


113    EXT. CONCOURSE WATERLOO -- SIMULTANEOUSLY -- DAY              113

       BOURNE on the move. Fast --

       Past platforms. On his way up to the Tri Panel.

       Up stairs. On to a walkway.   To his right he sees a figure
       disappearing...

       PAZ.

       BOURNE hammers down the walk - way in pursuit.


114    EXT. PLATFORM AREA -- DAY                                     114

       BOURNE tailing PAZ down on to a parallel platform. PAZ
       dipping down into the underground entrance.


115/116 INT. TUBE STATION -- WATERLOO -- DAY                 115/116

       PAZ moving deliberately through the evening rush hour--
       blending in...

       BOURNE in pursuit. Chasing on instinct.

       There...A glimpse of PAZ at the bottom of an escalator.

       BOURNE fights past people.

       PAZ disappears into the crowd.

       BOURNE rushes to catch him. Rounding a corner...

       A long walkway -- at the end, two staircases lead to
       different tube lines. BOURNE hesitates-- measures the
       choice.

       The sound of a train fills the station--

       BOURNE -- Fast downstairs.

       Watches-- just as PAZ gets onto the car at another door.

       BOURNE lunges to get on the train...But the doors close...

       BOURNE'S POV

       Watching PAZ from the platform as he SAGS down onto a seat,
       nauseated, his skin clammy, his head pounding...He takes
       out the PILLS and dry-swallows them...Looks up...

       CLOSE ON -- BOURNE

       Watching PAZ...As if he's looking in the MIRROR at his old
       self...The self before THE BOURNE IDENTITY...

                                                                33


       CLOSE ON -- PAZ

       He looks straight ahead, just another commuter...

       BACK ON -- BOURNE

       Watching PAZ, as the train pulls away...Then BOURNE is
       immediately in motion...

       DANIELS watches news of ROSS murder on TV. DANIELS panics,
       opens his safe, packs up papers, takes Blackbriar FILE.
       Sets alarm. Leaves.


120C   EXT. NIGHT. INTERNET CAFE -- LONDON.                      120C

       BOURNE sits at a computer, the ROSS notebook open in front
       of him. He pages through it, finding names, places, "HOW
       DID THIS ALL START?" -- and Blackbriar.   He Googles
       "Sewell and Marbury"-- finds Paris, Berlin, Madrid. BOURNE
       continues to search and finds receipt from Madrid.

       BOURNE leaves.

123A   INT. DAY.   POSH HOTEL -- NEW YORK CITY                   123A

       Vosen's sitting.

                             VOSEN
                       (to waiter)
                   Sparkling. And a "Heart-Healthy"
                   omelet with goat cheese and
                   peppers.

       Landy arrives.

                                                     34


                    VOSEN
          You're late. Traffic?

                    WAITER
              (handing her the menu)
          Ma'am?

                    LANDY
          Nothing for me.

Vosen looks at her, surprised.

                    VOSEN
          I'm buying.

She shakes her head, no. She sits, without taking her coat
off. She's not staying long.

                    VOSEN
          When the Director called, it was
          suggested we bring you on--

                     LANDY
          Suggested?
              (beat)
          Are you sure it was just a
          suggestion?

                    VOSEN
          Funny how different things look
          depending on where you sit. I
          look at this as doing a favor for
          you. Giving you an opportunity
          to complete some unfinished
          business.

                     LANDY
          Meaning?

                    VOSEN
          Jason Bourne.

                    LANDY
          Bourne's finished.

                     VOSEN
          Really?

                    LANDY
          It was finished the moment I
          realized I was chasing him for
          something he didn't do.   The
          case is closed.

                     VOSEN
          So what do you make of this?
              (handing her
               surveillance photos of
               Bourne in Paris)
          French intel picked up Bourne
          meeting Pierre Elattrache on
          Tuesday. He threatened to burn
          our house down if you didn't tell
          him who started Treadstone.
          That's a big problem, wouldn't
          you agree?

                    LANDY
          This doesn't feel like Bourne to
          me.

                    VOSEN
          Why's it so hard for you to
          believe?

                     LANDY
          Probably because it's coming from
          you, Noah.

                    VOSEN
          Lets try and be adults okay? We
          all thought he was done, off the
          grid. But Bourne's back. Maybe
          he's a threat. We both want the
          same thing here.

                    LANDY
          So what happened at Waterloo?

                    VOSEN
          We have a leak. Bourne showed up
          in our surveillance. We had very
          little time to react.

                    LANDY
          And the reporter ended up dead?

                    VOSEN
          Bourne saw us coming.

Landy looks at him, suspicious.

                    LANDY
          So what was he doing?

                    VOSEN?
          We don't know. But just the fact
          that he was there means he's up
          to something, don't you think?
          Maybe he's the source?

                                                                  36


                               LANDY
                     The real question is how you
                     managed to get in a fire fight in
                     the middle of a public train
                     station.

                               VOSEN
                     Don't second guess an operation
                     from an armchair, Pam. It's not
                     fair.

                               LANDY
                     I'm going to the office now.
                     I'll make my own introductions.

       Off VOSEN...


125    EXT.   DAY.    ATOCHA TRAIN STATION -- MADRID                    125

       AN AVE train pulling into the vast station. BOURNE stepping
       out, walking up the platform.

       Moving out through the station...


125A   INT. DAY -- CRI HUB                                          125A

       TWO NEW TECHS plus the three we met before.       All watching
       VOSEN lead LANDY and CRONIN into the room.

                               WILLS
                     This is Pamela Landy. She's
                     gonna be quarterbacking our
                     search effort. I think what we
                     oughta do, just to get started,
                     let's go around the room, say who
                     you are and what your spec is.

       LANDY stepping in before this gets going --

                               LANDY
                     Let's do names later.
                     (she's got the floor)
                     What's Bourne's last fixed
                     position?
                     (impatient)
                     Anybody.

                   You have an Echelon package?

                                TECH#1
                   Yes.

                             LANDY
                   Why isn't it on?

                             TECH#1
                   We were waiting.

                              LANDY
                   For what?
                       (no takers)
                   You're nine hours behind the
                   toughest target you've ever
                   tracked. I want everyone to sit
                   down, strap in, and turn on all
                   you've got.
                       (beat)
                   That would mean now.

       That lights it.    They're moving.

                                LANDY (CONT'D)
                   Thank you.

       VOSEN watches...

                             LANDY (CONT'D)
                   I want everything you've got on
                   Ross on screen one.

       LANDY watches as the screen lights up with ROSS
       information...


125B   EXT. DAY.   SEWELL AND MARBURY -- MADRID                125B

       Bourne arrives, begins to recon the area.

       He goes to the front door finds "Sewell and Marbury" and
       rings the bell. No answer. Two cops come around a corner.

       Bourne sees them, notes the side of the building and
       leaves.

                                                       38


125E   INT. DAY.   CRI HUB -- NEW YORK CITY             125E

                              TECH#1
                   Sir, we just hacked Ross's email
                   account at the Guardian and found
                   a round trip ticket to Turin,
                   yesterday. 0800 arrival, 12:05
                   departure.

                             LANDY
                   I think we can be pretty certain
                   that Bourne's not your source
                   then?

                             VOSEN
                   How?

                             LANDY
                   Ross's call to his editor, where
                   he said he just met the source on
                   Blackbriar, took place just after
                   his flight landed. His met his
                   source in Turin.

                             VOSEN
                   So?

                             LANDY
                   So, what, Bourne met Ross for
                   breakfast and then, at noon the
                   same day Bourne calls Ross to
                   demand a meet at Waterloo?

                             CRONIN
                       (Needling Wills)
                   Maybe they were even on the same
                   flight?

                             VOSEN
                   Cross check the secure cell phone
                   usage of everyone with Blackbriar
                   SCI clearance against all calls
                   in and out of Turin during the
                   morning Ross was there

       TECHNICIANS start pounding keyboards.

                             LANDY
                   The guy you're after is a CIA
                   operative with clearance above
                   Top Secret.   He was committing
                   treason by talking to Ross.   Do
                   you really think, while doing
                   that, he used a cell phone he
                   knows we can track?

                             TECH 3 (JIMMY)
                   Zero results on the cross check.

                                                       39


VOSEN stares daggers at her.

                    WILLS
          Do you have a better idea?

                    LANDY
          Yeah, I'd look at all the people
          whose cell phones were switched
          off the entire period Ross was in
          Turin.

                    WILLS
          Do it Jimmy.

TECHNICIANS start tapping.

                    LANDY
              (looks at Cronin)
          I mean if your people use their
          cell phones as much as mine do,
          the list should be pretty small

                    TECHNICIAN 3 JIMMY
          Three names: Tom Brewster, Jack
          Boulin, Neal Daniels.

The names display on the screen:   Tom Brewster, Jack Boulin
Neal Daniels.

The HUB employees can't help but be impressed by LANDY.
WILLS and VOSEN notice their response.

                    LANDY
          Now check everything in Ross's
          apartment against those names.
          Look for common patterns, look
          for -

                    CRONIN
          Initials .....Bring that up on
          main.

LANDY turns.   CRONIN is leaning down in front of a
computer screen.   Point to something for the tech --- who
puts it on the big screen, blown up.

In a set of handwritten notes by ROSS it says "per
N.D."next to several scrawls.

                    LANDY
          Neal Daniels.   He's Station
          Chief in Madrid now, isn't he?

                    WILLS
          Jesus Christ.

                                                                40


                            VOSEN
                  Call the RSO at the Embassy and
                  have them take Daniels into
                  custody if he's there.   If he's
                  not, get a grab team to the
                  Calle Norte safe house. Send
                  them in heavy and tell them we'll
                  assist with entry.

                            LANDY
                  "Heavy?" Daniels isn't--

                            VOSEN
                  I'm worried about Bourne. If he's
                  not Ross's source, then he must
                  be after Ross's source -- just
                  like us.

       Off LANDY...


125F   EXT.   MADRID STREETS -- NIGHT                             125F

       BOURNE in a TAXI turning a corner into a narrow street.
       The rain has slowed, but the streets are still quiet.

       BOURNE gets out and walks past the SEWELL and MARBURY front
       door, picks the lock and gains entry.


126B   INT.   SEWELL AND MARBURY. -- NIGHT                        126B

       BOURNE up the stairs.   Finds the office.    Jimmies the door.
       Disables the alarm.

       All the signs of a hurried exit. A half filled cup of
       coffee -- cigarette burned down in an ashtray but not
       snubbed out -- a light left on -- files and documents, some
       shredded, some not.

       Vosen paces back and forth. The hub is MUCH quieter than
       it was in the Waterloo scenes.

                            TECH 1. (LUCY)
                  Parque Vasquez is clean. No sign

127B   INT.   SEWELL AND MARBURY -- NIGHT                       127B

       BOURNE checks the office.   Soon he finds a photo of
       Daniels with Albert Hirsch.


FB3    EXT. HOSPITAL ANNEX -- OVERCAST DAY -- FLASHBACK            FB3

       Bourne arrives at a nondescript steel door with two CCTV

127B   INT. SEWELL AND MARBURY -- NIGHT                         127B

       The flashback overwhelms Bourne.

FB3C   INT. TANK ROOM -- FLASHBACK                              FB3C

       Bourne is dragged into a room with a large water tank. His
       hands have been bound behind his back, the sack's
       drawstring pulled tight, and he has been weighted down.
       Bourne is shoved into the water.


FB3D   UNDERWATER SHOT -- FLASHBACK                             FB3D

       Bourne falls into the water. SPLASH. He starts to sink.
       The wet sack allows us to see the outlines of his face.
       Also POVs as Bourne sinks.

                                                                  42


FB3E   SERIES OF SHOTS FROM ABOVE AND BELOW WATER --FLASHBACK      FB3E

       Bourne struggles wildly at first. Tries to get out of his
       restraints. But to no avail. SRD men watch him from the
       edge of the tank. Perhaps also on monitors.
       Expressionless.


FB3F   UNDERWATER SHOT - FLASHBACK                                 FB3F

       Bourne fights every human instinct to draw a breath.    Also
       shot from Bourne's POV:

                           HIRSCH (FILTERED, EERIE)
                 You're going to drown. There is
                 nothing you can do to prevent
                 this. Stop struggling and accept
                 it.


       Finally Bourne can't hold his breath for an instant longer.
       His mouth opens. Water rushes in. He convulses, begins to
       drown...


FB3G   INT. TANK ROOM -- FLASHBACK                                 FB3G

       Bourne's body goes limp.   SRD men watch.   No reaction.

       BOURNE comes out of the FLASHBACK. As he staggers across
       the room, he notices a car arriving on the monitor...


127C   EXT. STREET                                                 127C

127B   INT. SEWELL AND MARBURY                                     127B

       Bourne snaps out of it and sees the car on a security
       monitor.

       HAMMOND AND KILEY enter the building.

                                 HAMMOND

       BOURNE listens from his hiding spot.

       they've done it before...

                                                                  44

       KILEY gestures to a light moving under a door.

       Kiley crouching...leaning in...hand on the knob, and --

       Pulls the closet DOOR OPEN --

       Nothing. Sink, dishes. a small kitchen.         And... on the
       stove...a tea kettle and a spoon...

       Which is the last thing they'll remember, because...

       BOURNE -- coming around the corner fast -- full stop and --

       BOURNE lays out HAMMOND... KILEY turns to find BOURNE --
       who takes him out too.

       Then it stops.

       BOURNE yanks the headsets.       Closes the PHONE.

       The hub scrambles to answer that...       Landy paces in the
       background. Suspicious of Vosen...

                                                             45

                    How long?
                        (beat, loud, to the

136    INT. NIGHT.    MADRID SAFEHOUSE                             136

       ON A SECURITY MONITOR -- BOURNE sees another figure moving
       up the stairs...Checking his watch, reloading his gun.
       Twisting into the path to shoot as the door opens,
       hesitating because-

       It's NICKY.

       A beat -- long unbroken.

                              BOURNE
                    What are you doing here?

                              NICKY
                    I was posted here after Berlin.

                              BOURNE
                    Where's Daniels?

       The office PHONE goes. Bourne waving her to it.   She picks
       it up. He hits the speaker phone.


127H   INT. HUB                                                127H

                              NICKY (V.O.)
                    Hello.

                              VOSEN
                    Who is this?

                              NICKY (V.O.)
                    This is Nicky Parsons. Who's
                    this?

       Landy reacts to her voice...

       Both Vosen and Landy strongly suspect Bourne is there and
       listening...

       Vosen reads her "Duress Challenge" identity check off the
       screen. It reads:

       Challenge:    "Sparrow"

       Response if Under Duress:       "Ruby"

       Response if Normal:    "Everest"

                                                      46


                     VOSEN
          Nicky, I need to do an ID
          challenge first. Code in:
          "Sparrow."

Vosen looks at the screen to check her response...

                    NICKY
          Response: "Everest".

                    VOSEN
          Nicky, this is Noah Vosen. How
          long have you been on site?

                    NICKY (V.O.)
          I just walked in.

                    VOSEN
          We have two officers on site.
          Are you in contact with them?

                    NICKY (V.O.)
          They're down. Unconscious, but
          alive.

                    VOSEN
          Is there any sign of Daniels?

                    NICKY (V.O.)
          No.

                    LANDY
          Nicky, this is Pam Landy. We
          have reason to believe there is a
          connection between Neal Daniels
          and Jason Bourne.

                    NICKY (V.O.)
          Bourne, are you still looking for
          Bourne? I thought the case was
          closed.

                    LANDY
          No, some people are convinced
          he's still a threat. I disagree
          but to find out I need to talk to
          him.

VOSEN seething because LANDY has interrupted him...

                    VOSEN
          Hold on Nicky.

Vosen hits the mute button.

                    VOSEN
          What are you doing? You know
          Bourne's probably listening.

                                                              47


        Landy doesn't answer.    Vosen to Wills:

                             VOSEN
                   How long till back up arrives.

        Wills holds up three fingers.      Vosen unmutes.

                             VOSEN (CONT'D)
                       (into microphone again)
                   Listen, Nicky. I want you to
                   stay put and secure the premises.
                   It could be an hour until another
                   team arrives.

        LANDY piercing VOSEN with a look...

        BOURNE continues to hold the gun in her face -- NICKY is
        very calm considering the predicament she is in.

                               NICKY
                   Okay.

        DIAL TONE as the line gets closed at the other end.

                             NICKY
                   They know you're here.

                             BOURNE
                   How long do I have?

                   My car's outside.    I know where
                   Daniels is.

        BOURNE lowers his gun, grabs the phone and dials "1-1-2"

                                                             48

       BOURNE answers her in perfect Spanish with a perfect Madrid
       accent, but worked up, like a civilian would be...

                            BOURNE (SUBTITLE)
                  334 Calle Norte. I hear gunfire.
                  And men shouting. I think
                  they're Americans --

       BOURNE pushes the phone off the desk -- fires four shots
       into the ceiling -- calmly moves Nicky towards the back
       door...

                  just took out two more of my men.
                  Not to mention his ultimatum to
                  Ellatrache?

                            LANDY
                  The only way this has a happy
                  ending, Noah, is if we find a way
                  to bring Bourne in voluntarily.

                            VOSEN
                  He wants revenge, Pam. The only
                  realistic way to deal with this
                  is to eliminate the threat.

       BOURNE and NICKY rapidly descend.

                            BOURNE
                  Okay, where is Daniels headed?

                            NICKY
                  8 o'clock this morning, he wired
                  $100,000. to a numbered bank
                  account in Tangier.

                            BOURNE
                  Okay, Tangier is about 300 miles
                  away, we can make the morning
                  ferry.

                            NICKY
                  And then what?

                                                                   49

        Bourne and Nicky exit on to the street.     Suddenly they hear
        tires squealing nearby.

                             NICKY
                   They're coming.

        They continue to walk down the street towards Nicky's car.

        Vosen and Landy are watching this live.


        As they cross the street two MADRID POLICE CARS come around
        the corner the wrong way and screech to a stop.

        Vosen reacts...

        BOURNE and NICKY continue around a corner -- they get in
        her VW GOLF and drive away...

                 We lost Bourne.

                           KRAMER
                 You still think he's after
                 Daniels?

                           VOSEN
                 Yeah. Nicky's just the means.
                 But if we find Daniels, we'll
                 find Bourne.

                           KRAMER
                 Daniels knows way too much.
                 Daniels knows everything. We
                 can't let them meet.

                           VOSEN
                 I'll take care of it.

R145   INT. NIGHT. TRUCK STOP -- SPAIN                            R145

       BOURNE and NICKY sit over coffee.    A long silence...then:

                           NICKY
                 What are you after, Jason?   Why
                 are you looking for Daniels?

                           BOURNE
                 Do you know who this is?

       Bourne puts the photo of Daniels and Hirsch on the table
       between them.    She looks at the photo, points.

                           NICKY
                 That's Daniels.
                     (points at Hirsch)
                 I don't know who that is.

                           BOURNE
                 I have to get back to the
                 beginning...or I'll never be free
                 of this.

                              NICKY
                 Who is he?

                                                                 51


                              BOURNE
                   I think he started Treadstone.    I
                   remember meeting him.   I
                   remember the first day...
                       (beat)
                   Daniels brought me to him.

       Nicky looks back at him....not sure what to say.

                             NICKY
                   What happened?

                             BOURNE
                   An initiation...I guess...


FB3B   FLASHBACK                                                     FB3B

       QUICK FLASH: Bourne, head in sack, is held underwater,
       struggling desperately for breath--


R145   INT. NIGHT. TRUCK STOP -- SPAIN                               R145

       Bourne comes out of the flashback.      Nicky is looking at
       him....

                             NICKY
                   Jason...that wasn't some one-off
                   initiation. Daniels said they
                   did that to you over and over
                   again.   That's how they...

       She doesn't finish.    And Bourne doesn't ask her to.     Just
       a long pause.

                             BOURNE
                   Why are you helping me?

                             NICKY
                   It was difficult for me...with
                   you.

       BOURNE looks up.    Another long pause...

                             NICKY (CONT'D)
                   You really don't remember
                   anything?

                             BOURNE
                   No.

       NICKY'S face.

       Two SPANISH COPS enter the cafe.

                             BOURNE (CONT'D)
                   We should move.

                                                            52

                    Noah Vosen.

       Then he puts his thumb into a print reader. The safe door
       pops open. He pulls out a file marked "Top Secret."

       CRONIN makes his way down the hallway.

       LANDY works at her desk.       CRONIN enters...

                              CRONIN
                    They tracked Daniels' passport to
                    a hotel in Tangier. They're
                    holding up a bank transfer he
                    made to keep him in place while
                    they move an asset in from
                    Casablanca.

       Off LANDY.    This just keeps getting worse...


145C   INT. VOSEN'S OFFICE                                    145C

       Landy enters without knocking.

                              LANDY
                    Since when do you have
                    authorization for lethal action
                    against Daniels?

                              VOSEN
                    Since he cleaned out a Blackbriar
                    safe and fled to Morocco!

                              LANDY
                    So grab him--

                              VOSEN
                    I don't have the people on the
                    ground to do that and I'm not
                    going to risk that file falling
                    into the wrong hands.

                              LANDY
                    What's going on?    What's Daniels
                    got?

                                                            53


                          VOSEN
                What's he got? He ran all of
                Blackbriar's operations in
                Southern Europe and North Africa.

                          LANDY
                I think the world's well aware we
                have a rendition and lethal
                action capability at this point,
                Noah.

                          VOSEN
                For Christ's sake, Pam, he's got
                our entire playbook. Names,
                dates, ghost sites, how we train
                our assets.....

                          LANDY
                You still don't have the
                authority to kill him.

                          VOSEN
                Oh, yes I do, Pam.

      Vosen holds up the file we saw him pull out of his safe.
      It is labeled "Blackbriar: Lethal Action Protocol."

                           VOSEN
                That's what makes us special. No
                red tape. No more getting
                badguys in our sights and then
                watching them escape while we
                wait for some bureaucrat to issue
                the order.

      Landy opens up the file. Sees the words "instantaneous
      lethal action is authorized when..."

                          LANDY
                You just decide? No oversight.
                No checks and balances.

                           VOSEN
                Come on, Pam, you've seen the raw
                intel. You know how real the
                threat is.    We can't afford to
                have our hands tied like that
                anymore.

       TIGHT ON COMPUTER SCREEN: DESH'S ICON IS MOVING AGAIN

                            TECH
                  Sir, the asset is on the move, in
                  route to subject.


148H   INT. HUB - DAY                                               148H

                            TECH #1
                  Sir, the asset is back on course.

       VOSEN looks up.

                             WILLS
                  Sir, we have an unauthorized
                  breach. Someone with active
                  system knowledge has penetrated
                  out protocols. Information was
                  passed to the asset at 14.11.
                      (beat)
                  The trace is confirmed and valid.
                  It comes from a computer
                  belonging to Nicky Parsons.

       VOSEN looks over at Landy....his wheels turning.   A series
       of cuts between them.

                            VOSEN
                  Where did the course deviation
                  occur?

                            TECH (LUCY)
                  South to Rue Belgique.
                  Stationery at Place de France.

                            VOSEN
                  That's where Parson's is.

       He pauses, deciding what course to take.    Landy watches.

                                                     59


                    VOSEN
          When we're finished with Daniels
          send the asset after her. We
          find Parsons, we find Bourne.

                    LANDY (OVERLAPPING)
              (going to Vosen, firm)
          Noah, what are you doing?

                     VOSEN
          Not now.

                     LANDY
          Now.   I want to know what's going
          on.

                     VOSEN
          Not now.

                    LANDY
          I'm asking on what basis you're
          continuing this operation.

                    VOSEN
          On the basis that Nicky Parsons
          has compromised a covert
          operation. She is up to her neck
          in it.

                    LANDY
          This is about Daniels, not Nicky!

                    VOSEN
          She has betrayed us!

                    LANDY
          You don't know the circumstances!

                    VOSEN
          She's in league with Jason Bourne
          for Chrissake!

                    LANDY
          You don't have the authority to
          kill her or Bourne!

                    VOSEN
          Yes, I do Pam, it's right here
          and it's legal.

VOSEN slams a document on the desk.   INSERT SHOT:
"Blackbriar: Lethal Action Protocol."

                    LANDY
          She's one of our own.   You start
          down this path...where does it
          end?!

                                                                  60


                               VOSEN
                     It ends when we've won.

       LANDY turns and storms out...

                               VOSEN
                     Notify the asset of the
                     additional target.

                                 BRYAN
                     Yes, sir.

164A   EXT. DAY. TANGIER                                              164A

       As he rides his VESPA, DESH receives additional target
       information..Pictures of BOURNE and NICKY.

       DESH glances in his rearview mirror -- spots BOURNE.

                     Have the bank release the funds.

       A TECH calls DANIELS.


167    INT. DAY. VELASQUEZ HOTEL                                       167

       Daniels leaves.


168    EXT. DAY.     TANGIER STREET                                    168

       DESH parks the motorbike and walks around the corner,
       BOURNE follows.

       DANIELS' car coming down the street.     BOURNE stops and sees
       the car -- realizes the danger.

       BOURNE turns back to see DESH with the detonator in his
       hand.

       BOURNE locks eyes with DESH.      Before BOURNE can react --
       DESH detonates.

       BOOM! DANIELS is DEAD.

                                                         61


BOURNE is thrown across the street by the blast.     He lays
MOTIONLESS.

DESH POV. He looks back to see BOURNE not moving, lying in
the street.

DESH gets on his motorbike and heads off to kill NICKY.


EXT.   PETIT SOCCO -- CONTINUOUS                               *

NICKY still at that café waiting. Taking out her phone-        *

BOURNE speaking in Spanish - fishing for his papers.         *
Looking back up the street. Forming a plan. Checking his     *

No time for this.                                            *

BOURNE breaks away. Through the crowds into the traffic.     *
Police whistles- shouting. Confusion.                        *

The chase is on.                                             *

Three policemen turning into his path. No choice. BOURNE     *
taking them down. Sprinting out across the road.             *

A KID and his moped. Caught up in the police dragnet.        *
BOURNE leaping on the bike - kick-starting it.               *

Away into traffic as two squad cars turn and make chase.     *

BOURNE weaving through traffic. One hand on the bike the     *
other on the cell, desperately trying to call NICKY.         *

But now, at least he's got a dial tone.                      *

Really spooked now- looking around. Time to move.            *

Dismantling the phone instinctively - scattering it's        *
components.                                                  *

BOURNE choosing his exit.                                     *

Up ahead- a narrow alleyway - taking it.                      *

The squad cars crunching to a halt, behind him.               *

BOURNE parking up. Seeing the crowded streets. Looking up     *

BOURNE into a riad. Through a courtyard - up more stairs -    *
up a ladder. Out onto the rooftops. Scanning the skyline.     *
A beat. Has he misjudged?                                     *

No, there in the distance at the top of a narrow street-      *
NICKY walking slowly and behind DESH. Moving quickly.         *



BOURNE tailing him - trying to close the gap. Dipping down    *
through another riad - through an alley. Up more stairs.      *
Back up onto another roof. He's gained a few metres on        *
DESH.                                                         *

Desh goes up to the rooftops now. Bourne has him in sight -      *
DESH is prepping his gun with a silencer.                        *

DESH speeding up. BOURNE sees NICKY down below amongst the       *
crowds. In Desh's sights.                                        *

BOURNE knows he has to gain more ground.                         *

CABLE CAM shot - Two trained assassins leaping across the        *
narrow streets - silently effortlessly -- the cops down          *

unfolding above them.                                            *

BOURNE nearly on terms with him - then --                        *

DESH dipping down again into the street below.       Avoiding    *
the police -- he melts into the crowds.                          *

STEADYCAM SHOT - following BOURNE as he heads downstairs.        *
More stairs. Through a corridor then a courtyard -               *
bursting out of a door into the street -                         *

A police checkpoint. Right in his path.     Bourne forced to     *
dog leg and take another route.                                  *

BOURNE'S lost him- for the moment.                               *

Suddenly stopping - seeing DESH - knows instantly that he        *

NICKY looking to the rooftops -- taking the advantage.      Up   *
some steps -- into a riad.                                       *

Desh tracking her.                                               *

Anticipates her next move. Aiming to cut her off.                *


EXT.   RIAD ROOFTOP                                              *

NICKY up steps.    Out onto the rooftops.   Looking for a path   *
across them.                                                     *

Scrabbling across the roof of this crumbling riad.    Knows      *
she can't go back down.                                          *

She makes it across to the next building.                        *

Where Desh is...                                                 *


EXT.   ANOTHER ROOFTOP -- CONTINUOUS                             *

BOURNE up high.    Seeing NICKY on that other roof.              *

He can't get across to her.    Moving fast now.                  *

Down steps.   Into the riad courtyard.                           *


INT. RIAD                                                        *

BOURNE entering the hallway.                                     *

Moving up the stairs.   Towards Nicky.                           *

And towards Desh.                                                *

Meanwhile NICKY moving down. Looking out into the                *
courtyard below. The sound of POLICE getting nearer.             *

BOURNE hearing the POLICE too as he moves up onto a              *
landing.                                                         *

                                                                 *

BOURNE into a main room - something stirring on a couch - a      *
girl and her little sister having a siesta.                      *

In another room two small boys fast asleep.    TV playing.       *
One wakes.                                                       *

A noise on the stairs above. Quickly arranging a mirror -        *
getting line of sight - Bourne dipping into a corner.            *

It's NICKY.                                                      *

She gives him a look -- DESH is in here somewhere.               *

                                                         66


The door goes below them.   The noise of Police entering the   *
Riad.                                                          *

NICKY signalling to BOURNE - this way.                         *

They climb narrow stairs to the next floor.                    *

Down below Police begin searching rooms. Waking the            *
sleeping family. Shouting, crying. Commotion.                  *


INT./EXT. -- NARROW STAIRWELL                                  *

BOURNE and NICKY creeping up the steps.                        *

Then - suddenly NICKY spinning round as two silenced           *
bullets speed past her - And DESH bursting out of a landing    *
toilet.                                                        *

On to Bourne.                                                  *

Full on Treadstone fighting in the narrow stairwell.           *

Crashing into a tiny disused lift cage- silent constrained-    *
vicious.                                                       *

Downstairs a young POLICEMAN hears the noise- heading for      *
the lift.                                                      *

NICKY seeing the handle turn. Thinking quickly.   She sends    *
the lift up to the next floor.                                 *

The POLICEMAN stepping back from the door -- directing the     *
other cops out to the courtyard.                               *

People are spilling out into the atrium.   It's pandemonium.   *


EXT.   ROOFTOP -- CONTINUOUS                                   *

Bourne and Desh spill out of the elevator and onto the         *
roof.                                                          *

BOURNE kicking the gun - spinning across the floor - he and    *
DESH facing each other.                                        *

DESH with BOURNE - straight over the edge.                     *

DESH still on top - just.                                      *

A brutal exchange. Matching each other's moves like            *
shadows.                                                       *

Relentless. Rolling - falling onto another roof level.         *

And another.                                                   *

                                                                 67


       The two men tiring now. DESH grabbing for the bag.     The            *
       pills. BOURNE kicking them away.                                      *

       BOURNE has the upper hand now.      DESH'S reaction's slowing.        *
       No longer the match he was.                                           *

       BOURNE drags him to the ground.     He's finished.   Bourne's         *
       won.                                                                  *

       DESH- shivering -- convulsing.                                        *

       In the struggle, BOURNE strangles Desh.

194    BOURNE and NICKY hide DESH's body.                              194

                             BOURNE
                   Alright, we need to be dead.    You
                   need to code that in.

       NICKY CODES into DESH'S PDA -- BOTH OBJECTIVES
       ACHIEVED...In the CRI HUB the message comes up...VOSEN and
       LANDY believe NICKY and BOURNE are both DEAD...


196A   INT. DAY. HUB -- CRI -- NEW YORK                             196A

       The code from DESH remains on screen -- BOTH OBJECTIVES
       ACHIEVED -- like an EPITAPH for BOURNE and NICKY...VOSEN
       packs his briefcase. Turns to WILLS.

                             VOSEN
                   I want to be sure. Have the
                   station chief in Rabat confirm
                   the deaths and do a sub-rosa
                   check...And keep and eye on
                   Landy.

       Off WILLS...


197A   INT. DAY.   LANDY'S OFFICE -- DAY                            197A

       Cronin enters.

                             CRONIN
                   The hub just got word Bourne and
                   Nicky are dead.

       Landy looks at him.

                                LANDY
                   Confirmed?

                                CRONIN
                   Not yet.

       Landy looks away...thinking.      Wheels turning.

                                                                  68


                             LANDY
                   Get me a copy of Bourne's
                   personnel file.


195A    EXT. DUSK. PENSIONE                                        195A

        Bourne and Nicky enter.


198A    INT. DUSK PENSIONE -- WASHROOM -- TANGIER                  198A

        BOURNE scrubs the blood from his hands.    REVEAL Nicky
        watching him from the bedroom.


197     INT. DUSK. LANDY'S OFFICE (LONELY LANDY)                       197

        Landy sits at her desk reviewing files on Treadstone. Open
        on her desk we see the file she will be looking at in the
        Supremacy phone call.

        The way she examines the papers we get the sense she thinks
        something is missing, some piece, some file.


198A    INT. DUSK. PENSIONE -- WASHROOM                            198A

        Bourne scrubbing the blood from his hands. Nicky comes in,
        touches his shoulder. There's a tenderness to it, a re-
        assurance. For a moment it looks like Bourne might
        react...but the moment passes....


197     INT. DUSK. LANDY'S OFFICE (LONELY LANDY)                       197

        Landy opens a new file.   Bourne's operations.


198A    INT. DUSK. PENSIONE -- WASHROOM                            198A

        Bourne is toweling off.

                             BOURNE
                   I can see all their faces. But I
                   can't remember any names....


197     INT. DUSK. LANDY'S OFFICE (LONELY LANDY)                       197

        Landy looks at Bourne's kills. The faces Bourne remembers.
        But there names are here, and who they were, why they were
        killed.


198AC   INT.   NIGHT.   PENSIONE -- BEDROOM/SITTING ROOM          198AC

        Bourne and Nicky sitting together.

                                                                  69


                            BOURNE
                  I was starting to remember who
                  they were...in India...with
                  Marie.

       A beat.

                             NICKY
                  It's just going to lead to more
                  killing, Jason. Are you sure you
                  want that?

       Bourne takes her words in.    But who he is is eating him
       alive from the inside...

                            BOURNE
                  I've killed people and I've tried
                  to apologize for what I've done,
                  for what I am. None of it makes
                  it better...

       Another moment passes between them...then:

                            BOURNE
                  They're going to come for you
                  again. You are going to have to
                  run now.

       She gets up.


198    INT. BATHROOM                                                   198

       Nicky dies her hair BLACK.    Starts cutting it shorter.


199    EXT.   NIGHT.   TANGIER BUS STATION                             199

       Bourne walks with a now dark-haired Nicky. They exchange
       looks for a long beat. She turns towards the bus.

                            BOURNE
                  It gets easier.


197    INT. LANDY'S OFFICE. NIGHT                                      197

       Landy finds a denotation in Bourne's file that he was
       "recruited to Treadstone by Neal Daniels."   Further down
       the   page it says "Bourne was inducted into Treadstone at
       the Special Research Department facility at 415 E 71st,
       New York, NY."    Then "Facility closed by order of
       Director, June 2002."

198C   INT. TANGIER MORGUE                                         198C

       Bourne looks at the tattered remains of Daniels' body and
       belongings.

                                                              70


        He goes through his briefcase and finds a nearly destroyed
        piece of paper with "Noah Vosen - Director of Operations -
        CRI" written on it. Bourne slips the morgue attendant a
        bribe.


198DA   INT. VOSEN'S OFFICE -- DAY                                198DA

        Vosen is shaving.

                            WILLS
                  Station chief in Rabat just
                  called, they found a body.
                  Bourne?

                               VOSEN
                  Desh.


198DB   INT. AIRPLANE -- DAY                                      198DB

        On final approach to JFK. Bourne looks out the window to
        see the Verizano Narrows bridge.   And beyond it,
        Manhattan.   Bourne is coming home.


A202    EXT. NEW YORK                                             A202

        Establishes skyline.


200     INT. LANDY'S OFFICE. DAY                                   200

                            CRONIN
                  Pam, You need to see this.

        Landy follows CRONIN into--


201     INT. CRONIN'S OFFICE -- DAY                                201

        BOURNE'S PASSPORT is displayed on the computer monitor.

                            CRONIN (CONT'D)
                  This passport just cleared
                  Immigration at JFK ten minutes
                  ago. It's an early Treadstone
                  identity registered to Jason
                  Bourne but he never used it and
                  it never went to the grid.
                  Bourne's alive.

                            LANDY
                  They don't know.

                            CRONIN
                  No, if they knew Vosen wouldn't
                  be in his office right now.

                                                             71


202    INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL                                      202

       Bourne moves through the airport.

                           LANDY (O.S.)
                 It's a hell of a risk.

                           CRONIN (O.S.)
                 Yeah. Maybe Bourne wants us to
                 know, just like Naples, maybe
                 he's communicating.


201    INT. CRONIN'S OFFICE                                       201

                           CRONIN
                 Maybe he's trying to communicate
                 with you.

                           LANDY
                 Maybe we should communicate back.
                 Because I think I know what
                 Bourne's looking for.


202    SERIES OF SHOTS                                            202

       Bourne over the 59th Street Bridge -- arrives at CRI --
       goes into the adjacent building --


202A   INT. OFFICE BUILDING ACROSS FROM CRI -- DAY               202A

       Bourne uses his monocular to zoom in on a file Vosen is
       looking at -- he sees the word "Blackbriar." Vosen puts
       the file back in the safe.


203    INT. DAY. LANDY'S OFFICE -- CRI -- NEW YORK                203

204    INT. UNDEFINED SPACE                                       204

                           BOURNE
                 I hear you're still looking for
                 me.


203    INT. LANDY'S OFFICE                                        203

       LANDY puts down her pencil.   CRONIN watches.

                                                            72


                             LANDY
                Bourne?


206   INT. VOSEN'S OFFICE                                        206

      His phone rings.    He picks it up.

                          WILLS (TEL. V.O.)
                Get in here! Bourne called
                Landy!

      Vosen jumps up, sprints toward the hub--


203   INT. LANDY'S OFFICE -- DAY                                 203

                          LANDY
                I guess I owe you an apology.


207   INT. HUB -- BACK ROOM                                      207

      Vosen rushes in--

                          BOURNE (V.O.)
                Is that official?

                          VOSEN (OVERLAPPING)
                Are we triangulating?!

                           LANDY (V.O.)
                No. Off the record. You know
                how it is.

                             BACK ROOM TECH (OVERLAPPING)
                Trying--

                             BOURNE (V.O.)
                Good-bye.


203   INT. LANDY'S OFFICE                                        203

                             LANDY
                Wait.     Wait.

      She opens a file on her desk.


204   INT. UNDEFINED SPACE                                       204

      Bourne listening--

                          LANDY
                David Webb. That's your real
                name.

207   INT. HUB -- BACK ROOM                              207

                           VOSEN
                 Why the hell did she give him
                 that?

                           LANDY (V.O.)
                 You were born 4/15/71 in Nixa,
                 Missouri.


203   INT. LANDY'S OFFICE                                203

                            LANDY
                 Why don't you come in, and we'll
                 talk about it?
                     (beat)
                 Bourne?


204   INT. UNDEFINED SPACE                               204

                           BOURNE
                 Get some rest, Pam.


207   INT. HUB -- BACK ROOM                              207

                           BOURNE (V.O.)
                 You look tired.

      Vosen realizes--

                           VOSEN
                     (rushing out)
                 He's got line of sight on us!


203   INT. LANDY'S OFFICE                                203

       Landy takes out her gun.   Checks it.

       HIGH ANGLE:   Landy leaves CRI.


207    INT. HUB -- DAY                                             207

       Wills walks over to Vosen. The look in his eye indicates
       that he thinks there's something odd about this:

                            WILLS
                  Landy just left the building.

       Vosen looks at Wills.... A beat, Vosen's suspicion
       building, though he can't quite put his finger on what he
       suspects...

                            VOSEN
                  Check Landy's phone.   Is she
                  using it?


217B   EXT. NYC STREETS -- DAY                                 217B

       Landy receives a text message.

       Vosen leans in to the Hub's back monitoring room.

                             VOSEN
                  Nothing?   No calls since Bourne--
                  ?

                            BACK ROOM TECH
                  Wait a minute. Wait. She just
                  got a text.

                                                                 75

                     What the hell do you mean we

                     you can't read it--
                         (to Wills)
                     Are we on Landy?

                     I want that goddamn text.   We
                     need to get out in front of her!

                     Seconds...

       VOSEN paces anxiously.

                     Got it!

       TECH points at big screen: "Tudor City Pl & 42nd.   Ten
       minutes. Come alone. Come on foot."

                               VOSEN
                     Surround it. Anyone not on Landy
                     goes to Tudor City. Now!

       LANDY walks east toward Tudor City.   She looks around her
       for any signs of surveillance but finds nothing out of the
       ordinary.

       Vosen and AGENTS come running out of the front door.
       Others leave through a side entrance.   They jump in
       sedans.

       Vosen and agents race to Tudor city.   An electronic map on
       the dash.

                           AGENT 3
                 Copy, we're going to take a left
                 at 41st. One block, settle at
                 the corner.

                           VOSEN
                 Get the map up.

                           AGENT 4
                 It's a bad place to pick, it's
                 too exposed.

                           VOSEN
                 He wouldn't have chosen it if he
                 didn't have a reason.

       An agents trails her on foot.   Another parallels her from

       SERIES OF SHOTS: CRI cars arrive, careful to stay several
       blocks from the meet site. They jump out and try to set up
       surreptitious surveillance posts.

                 Okay folks here we go, box at two

       We can't tell where we are or what he's doing.

                           BOURNE (V.O.)
                 This is Jason Bourne.

       VOSEN reels for a beat. Then quickly scans the streets,
       trying to see if he can spot BOURNE.

                           VOSEN
                 How did you get this number?

                           BOURNE (V.O.)
                 You didn't actually think I was
                 coming to Tudor City, did you?

                           VOSEN
                 No, I guess not. But if it's me
                 you want to talk to maybe we can
                 arrange a meet.

                           BOURNE (V.O.)
                 Where are you right now?

                           VOSEN

                               BOURNE (V.O.)
                     I doubt that. If you were in
                     your office--


233    INT. VOSEN'S OFFICE -- DAY                                       233

       REVEAL that BOURNE is inside VOSEN'S office.

                               BOURNE
                     We'd be having this conversation
                     face-to-face.

       BOURNE hangs up. Puts a portable dictaphone up to VOSEN'S

       From the safe, BOURNE scoops out the "TREADSTONE:
       Blackbriar" folder Bourne saw Vosen putting into his safe."

       He flips it open. He scans down the page.         His eye
       stopping at the words "US Citizen."

       He flips to another page -- another photo, and again "US
       Citizen."

       BOURNE shoves the folders in his backpack and leaves.

       CAMERA BEGINS TO CRANE UP...

       BOURNE walks around a corner near CRI. He hears a siren
       turn on a few blocks away. Then another.   He starts to
       run.


240    INT. CRONIN'S CAR -- DAY                                   240

       A SEDAN pulls to a stop as a door comes open. CRONIN'S

240B    INT. CRI CAR -- DAY                                          240B

        The passenger side agent sees BOURNE, points--

        BOURNE cuts to the south side of the road so the passenger-
        side agent doesn't have a shot, while controlling the car
        makes it almost impossible for the driver to fire
        accurately.


240C    EXT. 41 STREET -- DAY                                        240C

        The westbound car cuts sharply and drives up on the
        sidewalk. But Bourne is too fast. He's already past them.
        The passenger side agent jumps out. But he's still got to
        get around the door and then move a few steps to get a bead
        over the hood of his car on Bourne.

        The other CRI car races the wrong way on the street but
        gets immobilized and trapped by the onrushing tunnel
        traffic.

        Bourne races through the tunnel traffic and onto 40th
        street.   He rushes east toward the spaghetti of concrete
        ramps leading into and out of Port Authority.

                                                             82


       He runs across 10th Avenue as a third CRI car screams up
       the street at him.

       jams the accelerator down.   He'll be on top of Bourne --

260    EXT. PORT AUTHORITY -- DAY                                  260

       A New Jersey-bound bus exits the complex and heads around
       the corner of the ramp -- it skids to a stop when it sees
       Bourne and the CRI car giving chase heading right at the
       bus.

       Bourne slides between the side of the bus and concrete
       guard rail.   The driver calls it in--


261    SERIES OF SHOTS                                             261

       Cops and CRI cars close in on Port Authority.   One agent
       jumps out of his car on 8th Avenue and rushes for the
       stairs.

                                                               83

262   EXT. ROOFTOP PARKING LOT -- PORT AUTHORITY                    262

      Bourne races up a set of stairs the rooftop parking lot.
      He surveys every aspect of his environment on the fly
      (which includes his taking a quick peak over the concrete
      railing at the east end of the roof.

      Next Bourne rushes toward the parked cars. Smashes the
      window of one to set off its alarm.   Then a second and a
      third, setting off their alarms.

      The fourth window Bourne smashes in doesn't set off an
      alarm. Bourne pulls the door open and climbs in.

      Inside the car Bourne reaches under the dash and yanks
      handful of wires off the steering column and starts to
      expertly hotwire the car.

      Agents race up stairwells.   Two CRI cars careen up the
      ramp to the passenger parking (a separate ramp to the bus
      ramp we saw Bourne on earlier.) A third CRI car races
      through the parking level just below the roof and up the
      circular ramp to the roof.

      EXT. ROOFTOP PARKING LOT -- PORT AUTHORITY

      Bourne works to hotwire the car.

      A CRI car gets to the roof.   Two agents come from the
      elevator lobby.   The three car alarms distract them. They
      search for Bourne, but can't find him at first...

      Bourne gets the car engine on - but, given the wonders of
      modern anti-theft technology his steering wheel is still
      locked.

                                                                84


      A second CRI car arrives.

      Bourne slams the car into low gear and backs up at high
      speed.

      He smashes into the car across the aisle from him. With a
      sharp metallic snap the wheel in Bourne's car is suddenly
      free, he jams the car into drive pulls out into lane and
      stops.

      Three CRI cars here now. Two head straight for him.   A
      third blocks the exit ramp.

      Bourne checks the rearview and sees two more agents pour
      from the elevator lobby, one carrying the serious firepower
      of an M-4 (an M-16 variant whose bullets can penetrate
      metal and concrete). They move into position to get a bead
      on him.

      Bourne assesses. But he doesn't move. The agents swarm
      toward him. What the hell is he doing? Why is he waiting?


267   INT. VOSEN'S SUV -- DAY                                        267

                We've got him! He's got nowhere
                to run!

                Take him out!


268   EXT. ROOFTOP PARKING LOT -- PORT AUTHORITY                     268

      The agents clear their obstructions and drop their barrels
      toward Bourne--

      But before they can get a bead--

      Bourne slams the car into reverse again.   Petal to the
      metal in reverse--

      The agents open fire.

      Bourne ducks the lead slugs ripping through the windshield.
      But there's no dodging the shower of broken glass.

      As Bourne disappears below the dashboard, the CRI agent
      adjusts his fire into the car's grill.

      Virtually blind, Bourne races the hard-pressed vehicle
      backwards as the agent's fire decimates the car's
      driveline.

      Bourne slips the car into neutral and takes a quick peek
      behind him.

                                                            85


      Steers still speeding but quickly dying car towards a small
      gap between two parked cars at the edge of the parking
      structure.

      Bourne's car splits the gap between the parked cars, hits
      the base of a low angled wall that slams the back of his
      car up and over the wall.

      Bourne is pounded as his car jounces onto the wall, a
      second later the front end seesaws over the top, the sudden
      angle change exposes for an instant the bottom of Bourne's
      car, to the shooters.

      Several rounds rip through the floorboard and tear past
      Bourne's head just before his car drops upside down for 25
      feet and slams onto a row of parked cars.

      The impact rips Bourne from the seat and slams him hard
      against the roof.

      Bourne struggles out of the car, knowing he has only a
      moment before the armed agents will fire down into his over-
      turned car.

                           CRI AGENT
                 Ho-ly shit!

270   EXT. ROOFTOP PARKING LOT -- PORT AUTHORITY                  270

      The CRI agents race to the spot where Bourne's car
      disappeared over the railing and reflexively fire into
      Bourne's car but they're too late! Bourne's already out.
      He disappears from sight under the covered parking
      structure.

        Clearly there is no one down there. Bourne's car jump from

274A    INT/EXT. CIRCULAR RAMP                                    274A

        Two CRI cars race down from the roof to try to get to the
        level Bourne's on.


275     INT./EXT. PARKING GARAGE -- TWO LEVELS BELOW ROOFTOP        275

        Bourne cuts off a guy cruising for a parking space and
        pulls him from his car and races away as the agent from the
        roof lands hard behind him.

        Bourne's race to the exit is cut off as a 3rd CRI sedan
        slides into view and it's occupants open fire on Bourne in
        a head on charge.

        The just stolen vehicle takes heavy fire as Bourne reacts
        instantaneously; thumbing on the cruise control,
        shouldering his door open, and slamming the gas pedal to
        the floor as he dives out of the car.

        The agents react as Bourne's sedan torpedoes them head on.
        Hit hard they're taken out of the fight as metal collapses,
        glass shatters, and airbags explode.

        Bourne tumbles to a stop at the rear of a parked car as his
        car implodes against the oncoming agents.

                                                       87


Instantly Bourne is on his feet, moving between the parked
cars to engage another CRI sedan traveling parallel to the
course of the wrecked one.

The agents in this sedan are distracted by the still
echoing crash and are caught off-guard as Bourne steps out
and points his gun at the driver.

The driver ducks and floors his gas pedal in a desperate
effort to save his own life. As the sedan suddenly
accelerates, Bourne deliberately shifts his aim to the
sedan's front tire and fires.

The tire explodes and the car suddenly veers left and slams
into a parked car, pitching the driver violently against
the unyielding interior of the sedan.

An instant later Bourne rips the radio off the dazed
drivers belt just before he cold cocks him with it.

With the wreck still echoing through the garage Bourne has
to deal with the arrival of the first NYPD sedan.

Bourne takes on the persona of an alarmed witness as the on
edge cop climbs out of his car but Bourne's performance is
cut short as the agent running from his drop from the roof,
arrives and opens fire.

The police officer goes down in the hail of gunfire as
Bourne turns and expertly drops the gunman with a single
shot.

The increasing volume of squealing tires alerts Bourne to a
new threat, he pulls the officer into some cover and grabs
the officer's radio.

                   BOURNE
          10-13. Shots fired. Officer
          down. Port Authority parking
          lot. Level four.

Bourne rips a piece of his sweater off and ties a makeshift
tourniquet for the officer.   Then he hands the cop his
radio back.

                    BOURNE (CONT'D)
          Stay out of sight until one of
          your own arrive.

Bourne disappears.

We pick him up as he jumps into the cops car and guns the
engine and heads for the exits.

CRI agents are confused for a second -- until they pick up
the NYPD car exiting Port Authority on one of the ramps.
But that's all the time Bourne needs--

                                                               88

277    EXT. CROSSTOWN STREET -- DAY                                 277

       Bourne turns on his lights and siren and speeds east,
       followed closely by a CRI sedan.

       As cars yield to Bourne's siren a taxi tries to jump into
       Bourne's wake but a CRI sedan punches the taxi back to the
       right. It ricochets off several parked cars before
       regaining control.

281    EXT. CROSSTOWN STREET -- DAY                                 281

       Bourne struggles to keep his over-matched vehicle ahead of
       the more powerful CRI Sedan which tries to spin Bourne out
       by hitting his bumper.

       Bourne tacks right quickly and barely avoids a stopped car.
       The CRI sedan flanking Bourne's slams into the rear of that
       car, spinning it 180 degrees into the path of the trailing
       CRI sedan which destroys itself in the resulting collision
       and blocks the path of the other CRI sedan.


282    INT. BOURNE'S CAR -- DAY                                     282

       Bourne is home free. He looks around and spots a sign that
       indicates a right turn and says "To Holland Tunnel / US
       95." Bourne turns right--

       Suddenly the window next to his head explodes as two more
       shots rip through his door to tear a jagged wound into the
       top of Bourne's leg.

       REVEAL Paz, his SUV racing along the curb lane. As
       Bourne's car crosses in front of a small car stopped at the
       intersection Paz swerves his car into that car and punches
       it into the side of Bourne's car.

       Bourne's car is knocked spinning, Paz keeps charging
       forward and slams into the back of Bourne's car. With his
       front tires spinning wildly Bourne fights to straighten his
       car as another CRI sedan appears and tries to box Bourne's
       car by sliding into his path.


283    OMITTED                                                      283

284    EXT. MANHATTAN STREET -- DAY                                  284

       Bourne just manages to punch his car into the right rear of
       the CRI Sedan and race down the Avenue with Paz and the
       slightly damaged sedan in pursuit.

       Paz gains on him and Bourne is forced to swerve violently
       to deny Paz the kill shot he is all too capable of.

       Just ahead of Bourne, two government SUVs slide into the
       intersection completely blocking his path.

       Bourne instantly spins his car 180 degrees and continues
       on, barreling into the roadblock backwards.

       As Bourne's car plows through the SUV's he whips the wheel
       and his car spins through a reverse 180 as Paz and the
       other sedan race through the wreckage in Bourne's wake.

       Paz and the CRI sedan are all over Bourne as he slides a
       right hand turn onto South St. as Paz and the CRI sedan
       overwhelm Bourne's battered vehicle.


284A   OMITTED                                                    284A


287    INT. BOURNE'S CAR -- DAY                                      287

       On his police radio, Bourne singles out an NYPD officer
       (call sign Alpha-2503) racing toward the intersection just
       ahead.

       Bourne slows, then speeds up quickly to time it right:

       The CRI car almost hits his bumper, then has to accelerate
       through the upcoming intersection. As he does, the cop car
       Bourne was listening to on the radio slams broadside into
       the CRI sedan drafting the bumper of the mangled cop car.

       Swerving wildly Paz avoids the pileup and slams his heavy
       SUV into the back of Bourne's car, pushing him into the
       oncoming traffic.

       Several cars swerve left and right as Paz pushes Bourne
       sideways onto the ramped end of a K-Rail dividing the
       street ahead.

       The nearly upended car grinds down the K-Rail until the
       rear of Bourne's car strikes an obstruction which punches
       it back into the lane as it slams against the front of
       Paz's SUV, knocking the SUV sideways, into a row of parked
       cars.

       Bourne's car hits parked cars on the other side of the
       road.

       SMOKE and STEAM -- SIRENS -- CHAOS

       THE CAMERA FINDS

       DR. HIRSCH, 70, is, put simply, not a man to be trifled
       with. He's a 45 year CIA veteran. One of the great brains
       in the Agency's history, but also a man who knows how to
       wield power silently, invisibly, and to tremendous effect.

       There's a wistfulness in the way he says it. But also the

                   4/15/71 isn't much of a code. My
                   guess is Vosen's already on his

                   David... Come in with me. It's

323    INT. LOBBY -- LATE AFTERNOON                                  323

       Landy runs across the lobby.


323    EXT. FIRST AVENUE -- LATE AFTERNOON                           323

       Vosen's SUV careens to a stop behind a bunch of traffic.
       Still a half block from the entry door but it's close
       enough--


322    INT. CORRRIDOR                                                322

       Bourne rushes down a nondescript corridor--


325    INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY -- LATE AFTERNOON                         325

       Vosen and CRI agents rush into the lobby.

                                                                   96


                             VOSEN
                       (to a group of six
                        agents)
                   I'll find Landy. You get to the
                   training wing and get Bourne!

       A security guard comes over.

                             VOSEN
                   Do you know who I am?
                       (the guard nods)
                   Where's your security room?


324    INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR                                           324

       Landy looks around. Finds an open office. She pushes open
       the door and runs to the fax machine. She starts faxing
       the Blackbriar documents Bourne took from Vosen's safe.


324A   INT. SECURITY ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON                         324A

       Vosen enters.

                             VOSEN
                   I want to see all your footage
                   for the last three minutes.


322    INT. SRD TRAINING WING (OLD BUILDING OF HOSPITAL) -- LATE 322
       AFTERNOON

       Bourne stares down the corridor from his dreams, the
       corridor Daniels lead him down in his flashback.

       We see Bourne go into--


FBA3   FLASHBACK                                                    FBA3

       That first day, Bourne's POV being led down this corridor
       by Daniels.


322    BACK TO SCENE                                                    322

       Bourne moves down the corridor.


322    INT. SRD TRAINING WING (OLD BUILDING OF HOSPITAL) -- LATE 322
       AFTERNOON

       Bourne reaches the end of the hall.       He looks around
       "flashback style" --

                                                                97


FBB3   FLASHBACK                                                 FBB3

       Bourne was standing at this door....


331    INT. OFFICE -- LATE AFTERNOON                                 331

       Vosen enters the room.    The last pages have been faxed...

                             LANDY
                   You better get a good lawyer.

       She exits...


322    BACK TO SCENE                                                 322

       Then spins, gun up--

       Hirsch is there, halfway down the corridor behind him.

                             HIRSCH
                   Put the gun down. I wouldn't be
                   here if I didn't want to talk.

                              BOURNE
                   I've spent three years running.
                   Three years trying to find out
                   who I was.

       Hirsch moves toward Bourne, completely unfazed by the gun.

                             HIRSCH
                   You still don't have it all back,
                   do you? You haven't filled in
                   all the pieces?

                             BOURNE
                   Let's start with the moment you
                   found out I wouldn't execute
                   Wombosi. The amnesia wasn't the
                   issue, it was the fact that I
                   didn't pull the trigger....

                             HIRSCH
                   One lapse meant your conditioning
                   had failed.

       Bourne grabs Hirsch and slams him against the wall

                             BOURNE
                   It was always you, behind
                   Conklin, behind Abbott.... They
                   were just following orders.

       Bourne grabs Hirsch and pushes him to the wall.   Searches
       him for weapons.

                                                             98


                             HIRSCH
                       (completely calm)
                   I'm unarmed, Jason.

                             BOURNE
                       (shoving Hirsch hard
                        against the wall)
                   "David." I'm David Webb.

       CLOSE ON Bourne's face--

                             HIRSCH
                   You were David Webb, but not
                   anymore.


322    INT. SRD TRAINING WING CORRIDOR -- LATE AFERNOON           322

       Bourne stands with Hirsch.

                              BOURNE
                   Why me?   Why did you pick me?

       A beat...

                               HIRSCH
                   You really don't remember, do
                   you?
                        (beat)
                   You picked us, Jason.

                             BOURNE
                   What does that mean?

                             HIRSCH
                   You volunteered.

       Hirsch uses his free hand to hit the keypad on the wall.
       The "room in use" sign lights up.

       Bourne looks up "flashback style"--


FBA1   FLASHBACK                                                  FBA1

       Bourne remembers that keypad, that "room in use" sign from
       the first day...


322    INT. ROOM WHERE BOURNE FIRST MET HIRSCH                    322

       Bourne and Hirsch enter...

                             HIRSCH
                   You volunteered right here....
                   You didn't even blink, Jason.
                   You just handed me these...

                                                             99


       Hirsch removes a pair of dog tags from his jacket pocket.
       Holds them out to Bourne.

       Bourne takes the dog tags.        Stares at them.

       INSERT of the dog tags:

       Webb, David

FB9    FLASHBACK                                                   FB9

       Bourne hands over his dog tags....


                              HIRSCH (CONT'D)
                    Has everything been explained to
                    you.

                                BOURNE
                    Yes, sir.

322    PRESENT DAY                                                 322

                              HIRSCH
                    You were a soldier ready to serve
                    his country. Just like thousands
                    of others, except you were a
                    prodigy with languages...and a
                    perfect shot.

FBB3   FLASHBACK                                               FBB3

                              HIRSCH (CONT'D)
                    Your missions will save American
                    lives.


322    PRESENT DAY                                                 322

                              BOURNE
                    You said I'd be saving American
                    lives. Instead you just turned me
                    into a killer.

       Bourne raises the gun to Hirsch.

                              HIRSCH
                    You could have left at any time.
                    And you knew exactly what it
                    meant for you if you chose to
                    stay.

                                                               100

                              HIRSCH
                    When we're finished with you,
                    you'll no longer be David Webb.

                              BOURNE
                    I'll be whoever you need me to
                    be, sir.


322    PRESENT DAY                                                   322

                              HIRSCH
                    Stop running from the truth,
                    Jason. You chose to come here!
                    You chose to stay! And no matter
                    how much you want to forget
                    it...eventually you're going to
                    have to face how you chose, right
                    there, to become Jason Bourne!



FB10   FLASHBACK:                                                 FB10

       Bourne sitting in a chair, looking terrible.     Hirsch looks
       at him from behind the desk...

                              HIRSCH (CONT'D)
                    You haven't slept for a long time
                    have you David? Have you made a
                    decision? This can't go on, you
                    know. You have to decide.

                                 BOURNE
                    Who is he?

                              HIRSCH
                    We've been through that.

                              BOURNE
                    What did he do?

                               HIRSCH
                    It doesn't matter.
                        (beat)
                    You came to us. You volunteered.
                    You said you'd do anything it
                    takes to save American lives.
                    You're not a liar are you? Or too
                    weak to see this through? This is
                    it. Let go of David Webb. Will
                    you give yourself to this
                    program?

                                                             101


      Bourne looks down, a gun in his hand. He gets to his feet
      swiftly and fires the pistol several times into a hooded
      figure. The man slumps over.

      Bourne stares at what he's done.

                          HIRSCH (CONT'D)
                You're no longer David Webb.
                From now on you'll be known as
                Jason Bourne. Welcome to the
                program.

      Daniels pulls the hood off the figure to show that he is
      dead.

      Just then Kramer walks through the door.

                          KRAMER
                He's ready. Send him to
                Operations.


322   PRESENT                                                      322

      And now, in real time, Bourne comes out of the flashback.
      He stares back at Hirsch....

                          HIRSCH
                Do you remember now?

      Bourne lowers the gun.

                          BOURNE
                I remember. I remember
                everything.

                          HIRSCH
                You can't outrun what you did,
                Jason. You made yourself into
                who you are.

                          BOURNE
                I'm done running.  That's why
                I'm here. To end you, to shut
                this down. I'm no longer Jason
                Bourne.

                          HIRSCH
                So now you're going to kill me?

                          BOURNE
                No. You don't deserve the star
                they give you on the wall at
                Langley.

      Just then Bourne spins -- agents arrive at the door.    It's
      locked.

                                                            102


322   INT. HALLWAY                                                322

      The agents fire at the door handle to get it open.


322   INT. ROOM WHERE BOURNE FIRST MET HIRSCH                     322

      Bourne looks out a window.   Sees the layout of a roof
      several stories below. Then he turns and shoots out the
      room's mirrored observation window. Bourne dives through
      it just as agents rush in and open fire at him.


      SERIES OF SHOTS

      Bourne races through corridors, loosing the CRI agents.


352   EXT. ROOF -- NIGHT                                          352

      Bourne runs out onto the roof. Rushes across it to look
      over the edge.   It's a straight drop to the FDR -- 12
      stories down.

      He races to another ledge -- the East River below him. But
      he has to clear a 10 foot supporting wall at the base of
      the building to hit the water.   He backs up to get a
      running leap.

      As he does, he turns and sees Paz, who is holding a gun on
      him.

                             PAZ
                   Why didn't you take the shot?

      Bourne looks at him.

                             BOURNE
                   Do you even know why you're
                   trying to kill me? Look at what
                   they make you give.

      Bourne turns and runs off the roof.

      Paz fires into the air...

      FOLLOW Bourne as he drops fourteen stories into the
      freezing river--

      MULTIPLE ANGLES -- Bourne goes into the river...


352   UNDERWATER                                                  352

      Bourne in a dead man's float...as his clothes soak through
      he begins to sink....

                                                            103


      PULL BACK...farther and farther from Bourne's dead still
      sinking....as OVERLAPPING, INTERWEAVING VOICE OVERS begin:

                   Assassination program code-named
                   "Blackbriar" was exposed by a
                   former assassin named David Webb--
                   -

                             ANCHOR 3 (V.O.)
                   Program reportedly targeting US
                   Citizens in some cases...

                             ANCHOR 4 (V.O.)
                   CIA Director Ezra Kramer produced
                   explosive documents for the
                   Senate Committee indicating
                   "Blackbriar" was authorized at
                   the highest levels of government.


356   INT. BAR -- URUGUAY -- SUNSET                               356

      Nicky goes to the bar of at a low end tourist bar with
      several other customers.   She stands there, eyes fixed on
      a TV behind the bar:

                             ANCHOR 5 (V.O., CONT'D)
                   Webb, who was known inside the
                   intelligence community, as "Jason
                   Bourne" jumped from the
                   fourteenth floor of the CIA
                   facility where he was trained in
                   New York into the East River
                   below.   While experts say it
                   would be nearly impossible to
                   survive the fall, despite two
                   weeks of efforts, his body has
                   still not been recovered.

      PUSH in on the smile that develops on Nicky's face.   As we
      CUE the Moby "Extreme Ways" sting---


352   UNDERWATER                                                  352

      Bourne's body sinking toward the bottom...when all of a
      sudden it comes to life -- arms together, legs kick
      powerfully--

      And Bourne swims away...
