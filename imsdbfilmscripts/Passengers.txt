          EXT. INTERSTELLAR SPACE

          A million suns shine in the dark.
          A STARSHIP cuts through the night: a gleaming white cruiser.
          Galleries of windows. Flying decks and observation domes.
          On the hull: EXCELSIOR - A HomeStead Company Starship.
          The ship flashes through a nebula. Space-dust sparkles as it
          whips over the hull, betraying the ship's dizzying speed.
          The nebula boils in the ship's wake. The Excelsior rockets
          on, spotless and beautiful as a daydream.

                         

          INT. STARSHIP EXCELSIOR - GRAND CONCOURSE

          A wide plaza. Its lofty atrium cuts through seven decks,
          creating tiers of promenades framing a vast skylight.
          The promenades are empty. Chairs unoccupied. Beetle-like
          robots vacuum the carpets and wax the floors.

          Lounge furniture and star-filled windows. Completely

          Endless corridors lined with vertical glass tubes. Inside
          each tube stands a PASSENGER. Eyes closed in sleep. If
          they're breathing you can't tell by looking.
          They sleep on their feet, leaning against padded supports.
          Straps secure them in place; sensors adhere to their skin.
          They wear shorts and tank tops with HomeStead Company logos.
          We survey their faces. No children, no senior citizens. Men
          and women of every ethnicity in the prime of their lives.
          We settle on one man. JIM PRESTON, 38. Sound asleep. A small

          A deep BOOM. Echoes roll down the corridors.
          Lights wink on in Jim's hibernation pod. Machinery hums to
          life. Instruments beep and chitter.
          Medical data fills the pod's screen. Jim's temperature rises.
          His heart begins to beat. He takes a breath.
          Jim opens his eyes.
          Groggy, blinking, seeing nothing.
          The backrest behind him converts into a recliner, lowering
          him into a seated position.
          The sensors on his skin drop off and snake back into the
          pod's machinery.
          A video screen descends before Jim's eyes.
          ONSCREEN - A beautiful stewardess appears, beaming at the

                    Hi. I'm Jim Preston. I'm a passenger
                    on the Excelsior. Something went
                    wrong with my hibernation pod and I
                    woke up too soon. Ninety years too
                    soon. I can't get back to sleep.
                    Nobody else is awake.
                        (with growing panic)
                    If I don't figure something out, I'm
                    going to die of old age before we get
                    to Homestead II. So help me out here.
                        (takes a deep breath)
                    I'll keep trying to fix this. Maybe I
                    missed something simple. But I could
                    use a hand. Thanks.

                         GRAND CONCOURSE
          Jim crosses the Concourse like a sleepwalker in his robe and
          slippers. He looks shell-shocked.
          He comes to the Concourse Bar: the fanciest watering hole on
          the ship. Black leather stools along a marble bartop.
          Jim touches the bartop...and a MAN swings up behind the bar -
          as if mounted on a hinge. A handsome fellow in a bartender's
          uniform - his hair and skin eerily perfect. This is ARTHUR.
          Jim jumps out of his skin.

                    afternoon. Are you drinking or not?
          He produces a cloth and polishes the bartop. In a startling
          movement, he glides the length of the bar, polishing all the
          way, and glides back as if on roller skates.
          Jim steps up on the footrail and peers behind the bar.
          Arthur's body stops at the waist. He's mounted on rails,
          built into the bar.

          beside him. The Hibernation Systems manual lies open.
          Jim tinkers with the electronics inside his pod.
          The pod hums to life. Its data screen flickers with
          information. Mysterious WHIRS and THUNKS.
          The canopy opens.
          Elated, Jim bounces to his feet. Strips off his shirt and
          scrambles in. The canopy closes over him.
          He assumes the position, his back against the backrest,
          waiting for the pod to put him to sleep.
          Nothing happens. He pokes at the ports where the sensors and
          intravenous lines used to protrude. Shakes the machine.
          He gives up. It's not working.
          But now he's trapped inside the pod.
          He pushes at the canopy, but it's locked shut. He pounds on
          the glass with no effect. Finally he loses it, shouting and
          stamping, hammering and raging - all muffled behind glass.
          Exhausted, he sinks to the floor of the pod, staring out at
          his tools and his manual, his discarded shirt.
          Then he notices the emergency release handle down by the

          INT. CREW HIBERNATION FACILITY DOOR - MORNING

          Jim works on the door with an industrial LASER CUTTER. Sparks
          fly. He's drenched in sweat. Mussed and unshaven.
          He lifts the goggles and inspects the door. The laser cutter
          has barely marked the surface.
          The door's a mess. Its switch hangs on wires. There are pry
          marks around the latch. Gouges around the window. Failed
          drill holes. Dents left by an axe.
          But the door stands firm.
          Jim lets the laser cutter fall. It joins a scrapyard of tools
          on the floor: sledgehammer, jackhammer, drill, crowbar, axe.

          CONCOURSE BAR - DAY
          Arthur stands behind the bar polishing glasses. Jim sits,
          sweaty and grimy, a whiskey in front of him.
          His speech is soft around the edges. He's had a few.

                    snap your fingers and be wherever you
                    wanted to be. Back on Earth, or on

                    I'll bet even if you got your wish,
                    you'd still feel this way. Not in the
                    right place. Supposed to be somewhere
                    else. That's not a crisis, it's the
                    human condition.
          Jim takes a moment to consider that.

                    can't get so wrapped up in where
                    you'd rather be that you forget to
                    make the most of where you are.

                    Arthur. Say you were trapped on a
                    desert island, and you had the power
                    to wish somebody there with you. You
                    wouldn't be alone anymore, but you'd
                    be stranding another person on the
                    island. Would you make the wish?

                    I don't know. I've never been on an
                    island.

                    Okay. Say you figured out how to do
                    something that would make your life a
                    hundred times better. But it's wrong,
                    and there's no taking it back. How
                    wrong would it have to be to stop
                    you? I mean, what if it made your
                    life a thousand times better? How do
                    you do the math?

          EXT. STARSHIP EXCELSIOR

          The ship forges through space, its lit windows shining.
          Jim paces back and forth on a promenade, a tiny figure
          dwarfed by the mighty ship and the tapestry of stars.

                         

          DECK TWO - HALL OF FAITH - DAY
          Jim passes under a sign reading "Hall of Faith," into a
          circular walk.
          There's a small fountain in the middle of the circle. Around
          the edges, doors labeled: BUDDHISM, JUDAISM, HINDUISM,

          CHRISTIANITY, ISLAM, OTHER FAITHS.
          Jim walks the circle, looking through the doorways: a cross,
          a Buddha, an abstract sculpture in the "Other Faiths" chapel.
          He continues around the circle and out into the ship.

          Jim opens a door marked "Starboard E.V.A. Room - No
          Passengers Beyond This Point!"
          The E.V.A. Room is dominated by an airlock. Spacesuits in
          racks. Tools, tethers, shuttle docking rings.
          Jim goes to the airlock. Opens the inner door.
          A BUZZER sounds a warning.

                                                                       33.

                         

                         
          He steps into the airlock. The door closes behind him.
          Jim looks at the red lever that opens the outer door. He
          grips the lever. Looks thoughtfully out at the stars.

                         

          EXT. STARSHIP EXCELSIOR - STARBOARD AIRLOCK

          The airlock outer door opens with a blast of air. Jim emerges
          from the airlock - wearing a SPACE SUIT.
          He plants his feet on the hull and walks up the side of the
          ship on magnetic boots.

          Jim stands, face uplifted. The cosmos reflected in his visor.
          Raises his arms. Imploring the heavens for an answer.
          But no answer comes. His lifted arms fall.

          Jim exits his cabin in his coveralls, carrying his toolbox.
          He finds a squadron of housekeeping robots waiting outside.
          He taps the "PLEASE SERVICE" button beside his door.
          The robots zoom inside with squeals of joy.

                         

          HIBERNATION BAY - AURORA'S POD
          Jim stands in front of Aurora: toolbox in one hand, the
          technical manual in the other. He's breathing hard.
          He sets the toolbox down. Opens the manual. It's densely
          annotated in Jim's handwriting.
          He opens the pod's cover panel and goes to work, following
          the steps in his manual. His hands shake.
          He starts to close a final contact.
          Stops.
          Gets to his feet. Stands looking at Aurora.
          Quickly he kneels and completes the circuit. Pulls his hands
          away as if the metal had burned him.

                     Okay.
          Aurora's pod hums. Medical data flows across its screen. Her
          vital signs re-start. Her pale skin flushes with color.
          Jim beats a retreat.

          Aurora's perfect lips part. She takes a shallow breath - and
          then a deep one. Her chest rises and falls.
          Her thighs shift as she bends her knees. The sensors on her
          body drop off and withdraw into the pod.
          She opens her eyes. They're beautiful.
          Her pod's backrest flexes, scooping up her knees as it
          becomes a seat. A video screen drops in front of her.

          He splashes water on his face. Stares into the mirror.

          DECK TWO - VIRTUAL MUSEUM - EVENING
          Jim and Aurora walk through the museum's white rooms. The
          walls display a Jackson Pollock collection.
          Aurora goes to the control podium. Scrolls through the menu,
          covers her eyes and chooses blind.
          The wall panels fill with Heironymous Bosch paintings -
          medieval visions of Hell. She winces and chooses again. A
          somber collection of portraits by Dutch masters. She frowns.
          Jim steps to her side and makes a selection.
          The walls fill with abstract landscapes - stark plains and
          oceans, with lonely figures isolated in the vastness.
          The images pull Jim and Aurora in: they stand before a dark
          seascape.
          Without thinking she reaches out and tucks her hand in the
          crook of his elbow.

          Underwater she smiles.

                    The starship's designers gave the
                    ship a daily rhythm. The light is
                    warm in the morning, bright during
                    the day, cool at night. We need those
                    changes. But I miss other rhythms.
                    There are no holidays here. Every day
                    is a day of leisure. There are no
                    seasons. The sky never changes.
          A mechanical whir distracts her. She looks down.
          Jim's pet robot looks up at her with binocular eyes. It
          carries a note in a clip on its back. Aurora pulls it free.
          A handwritten invitation from Jim. It reads:

          The doorbell rings. She answers it.

          back into frame and tackles him. They tumble to the deck.

          Jim and Aurora lie in Jim's imperial bed, glistening with
          sweat and breathing hard. She lays her head on his shoulder,
          her eyes far away and wistful.

                                               JIM

          Through the window, Jim and Aurora lie together in the

          We pull out, the window dwindling, as the Excelsior soars
          away from us into the stars.

          VIENNA SUITE - BEDROOM
          The best suite on the ship. One one side of the bedroom,
          Aurora's mementos and possessions. On the other side, Jim's.
          They wake together. She kisses him on the cheek with the ease
          of long habit and heads for the shower. He watches her go.

          Jim kneels at the edge of the pool, in coveralls and work
          boots, a tool belt slung over his shoulder.
          Aurora pulls herself up and kisses him.

          FORWARD OBSERVATION DECK - DAY
          Aurora writes on her sofa, surrounded by electronic slates,
          each displaying a reference book or research paper. On one, a
          map of the Polynesian archipelago.

                    The Polynesians set out into the
                    Pacific Ocean with no destination.
                    Searching for islands. They sailed
                    into the endless sea on faith.

                         

          SUBDECK A - NUMBER EIGHT CARGO HOLD - DAY
          Jim walks among the towering cargo racks. His flashlight
          illuminates machines stacked from floor to ceiling: tractors
          and combines, helicopters and seaplanes.

                              AURORA (V.O.)
                    Some never returned, but others found
                    land, and prospered. What drove them
                    out onto the sea? Curiosity?
                    Tradition? The wish for something
                    better?
          Jim opens cargo containers. He finds ingots of metal,
          computer components, spools of superconducting wire. Raw
          materials for a young world.

                              AURORA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    The urge to move is as primal as
                    hunger or thirst. We run, we drive,
                    we sail, we fly.
          Jim finds a stash of utility golf carts and his eyes light
          up. He unpacks one, starts it up. Drives off into the dark.

          Jim drives his cart into a new bay - and stares in wonder.
          In oversized hibernation pods: cattle, horses, sheep, oxen.
          All asleep. Chickens, ducks and geese in individual cells.

                              AURORA (V.O.)
                    Like seeds, we carry what we need.

                    winds of chance.
          The next aisle holds plants in stasis: saplings in tubes,
          seedlings in individual vials.
          Jim stops in front of a glass case. Rosy light bathes his
          face. He smiles. We don't see why.

          VIENNA SUITE - BEDROOM - EVENING
          Aurora sits with her slate. Eyeing Jim's side of the room.
          Giving in, she begins to explore Jim's possessions: poking
          into the drawers of his nightstand and dresser.
          She opens his closet. Shifting things, she finds a dog-eared
          manual on hibernation pods. She pulls it out.
          There's a bookmark in the pages. She goes to open the book -
          and the bookmark slides into her hand.
          It's the photo strip Jim took during his isolation: Four
          identical shots of his face, bearded and hollow-eyed. The
          melancholy images hit her hard.
          She touches the pictures to make them move: but Jim sits
          immobile. In the fourth image, he sighs heavily.
          Voices in the hall.

          duffel bag in hand.

                    I'm not sure what I'm doing anymore.
                    I was writing a book, and I was
                    keeping a diary. But the book and the
                    diary are running together. I think
                    I'm writing about us.

                    I'm not sure I want to write about
                    this life. I don't even know how to
                    think about it. I live in a palace.
                    But it's also a prison. I'm moving at
                    half the speed of light and I can't
                    go anywhere!
          Jim takes that in.

                    The cargo hold is full of pioneer
                    gear. There's a submarine down there,
                    can you believe it? Ships and
                    airplanes and bulldozers. That's what
                    I wanted, a world still being built.
                    But I'll never see it.
          They sit for a moment in glum contemplation.

          Jim unzips his duffel bag and takes out a bouquet of long-
          stemmed roses. Aurora gasps. Reaches out to touch them.

          The deep RUMBLE is louder. A bloody light fills the sky.
          A STAR looms ahead of the ship: a RED GIANT. The Excelsior
          rockets toward the star.
          The passage takes less than a minute. The Red Giant swells in
          the windows. The ship shudders. The engines howl. Aurora
          falls into Jim's arms. The ship bathed in red light.
          The star fills the skylight, fills the sky itself. A fiery
          surface turbulent with sunspots and mysterious currents. The
          engines howl.
          And then they're past. The star recedes, dwindling as quickly
          as it grew. The engines quiet. The ship's calm restored.

          FORWARD OBSERVATION DECK - DAY
          Aurora paints, wild-eyed and fragile.
          Her brushstrokes are fierce. She slashes at the canvas. As
          she paints she begins to cry, silently. She doesn't stop
          painting. The easel shakes as she works.

          Jim kneels on the Grand Concourse. He's torn a huge hole in
          the carpet to expose the deck plates beneath.
          With his laser cutter he cuts a large rectangular hole. Pries
          the plate up with a crowbar, opening a cavity in the deck.

          Aurora paces in her bathrobe, hair wrapped in a towel.
          She looks at her gallery of snapshots. Touches the pictures
          one by one. The faces begin to move and speak. A cacophony of
          good wishes. Laughter and cheers.
          Finally only one clip still plays. Aurora's mother.

                    an inventory of the spares. I know

          HIBERNATION BAY - AURORA'S POD - DAY
          Gus kneels in front of the pod, examining the mechanism.
          Alone, he doesn't hide his difficulty: sweating and panting.
          Something he finds inside the machine makes him forget his
          symptoms. He stares, astonished.

          from Jim to the pod mechanism and back again.

          slate down beside him.

          want to get into this: he looks away uncomfortably.

                    Only place I ever wanted to be. When
                    I was sixteen I lied about my age and
                    got onto a lunar shuttle crew. A few
                    years later I moved on to planetary
                    ships. Made the Venus run a hundred
                    times, then Jupiter and Saturn. Then
                    the gravity drive came along. Real
                    spaceflight. I did everything I could
                    to get onto an interstellar ship. I
                    was thirty-six years old the first
                    time I saw an alien sun. No going
                    back after that. I've walked on

                    systems.

          Gus pushes himself off his stool. Momentarily shaky, he pulls
          himself together.
          He takes a seat at the grand piano and plays - a fine
          beerhall pianist. Gus touches a switch and lifts his hands:
          the piano keeps playing.
          Gus stands and extends a hand to Aurora. She takes it, and
          Gus sweeps her across the floor.

          Suddenly he SHOUTS, a wordless cry of anger. Pounds on the
          dresser with his fists. Teeth clenched in pain and fury.
          Then he straightens. Stands at attention. Takes a deep
          breath. Pivots on his heel and leaves the room.

          Inside the reactor is a caged sun: an orb of fire hanging in

          Red lights flash. Claxons sound. The door begins to close.
          Jim pulls a HAMMER from his belt and jams it crossways in the
          doorway, propping open the door. The door's motors whine.
          Jim dives inside. Skids to a stop beside Aurora. Pulls her
          loose from the column and shoves her toward the door,
          fighting the wind.
          Aurora scrambles through the doorway. Jim tries to follow -
          but the hammer suddenly bends and springs out of the doorway.
          The door slams: Aurora outside, Jim in the airless room.
          The last of the atmosphere flashes away into space.
          Aurora screams and pounds on the other side of the door. But
          Jim hears only his own thudding heartbeat.
          The last air leaves Jim's lungs in a silent shout, vapor
          whipping away between his teeth.
          He spins. Scans the room desperately.

          He falls ACROSS THE HOLE. Metal fangs inches from his body.
          He strains to avoid being speared or sucked out into space.
          The air jets stop. The wind dies as the air escapes.
          Jim lunges back to the open drawer. Pulls the LASER CUTTER
          from his tool belt and cuts the entire drawer free.

          Jim rides the wind, sliding across the steel deck and
          SLAMMING the steel drawer across the hole in the hull.
          Air screams away through the gaps.
          Jim lunges to an emergency locker and pulls out an epoxy
          foamer - a steel canister like a fire extinguisher. He aims
          it at the hole in the hull and pulls the trigger.
          ORANGE FOAM blasts out, stiffening into a hard plastic. Jim
          buries the steel drawer and the hull breach in foam.
          His eyes flutter closed. Starved of oxygen, he falls limp.

          He's not fast enough. The pod slides up and out of sight.

          INT. CREW HIBERNATION FACILITY

          Jim slams into the facility at a dead run. Scans the crew
          hibernation pods. Picks one and goes to work.
          Aurora enters. Looks at the man inside the hibernation pod: a
          stern fellow with a bristling gray beard.

                                             AURORA

                    The Captain.
          The sounds of the ejection wave come closer. Boom-chak.

          BOOM-CHAK! A crewman's pod vanishes into the ceiling on the
          opposite side. The ejections march down the row.

                                                  AURORA
                       Go go go!
          The wave of ejections reaches the end of the facility and
          marches back on Jim's side.

                                                  JIM
                       Got it!
          The hibernation pod hums to life.
          Inside, the Captain opens his eyes. He stares in astonishment
          at the first thing he sees: Aurora, in her bathing suit and
          shirt, a disheveled angel.

          BOOM-CHAK!
          The pod beside the Captain's shoots out of sight. He sees it.
          Looks at Aurora in alarm. Reaches out, his hand spread flat
          on the glass.
          She reaches back, her hand matching his.
          The Captain's pod rises through the ceiling and vanishes. Jim
          roars in frustration. Aurora leaps back with a cry of horror.

          Jim and Aurora stare out the windows. In the ship's wake,
          five thousand pods glitter like diamonds. The cloud of pods
          dispersing as they watch.
          Stricken, Aurora walks away.
          Jim watches her go, then turns back to the window, looking
          out at the tumbling sparks.

          panel is a sea of green. Only a few red lights remain.
          Aurora enters.

          Aurora's writing couch. Jim and Aurora sit facing each other.
          Aurora gathers her thoughts. Takes a deep breath.

                                             AURORA
                    You know, if it wasn't for you waking
                    me up, I'd be drifting out in space
                    right now with the others. And if
                    you'd never awakened, the whole ship
                    would have been lost while we slept.
          Jim shakes his head at the tangle of it.

                                             AURORA (CONT'D)
                    But no matter how we got here, the
                    fact is that we're here. All I know
                    is, when I have a good idea, you're
                    the person I want to tell. When I
                    wake up in the morning, I wish you
                    were there. When I look at you, I
                    just see Jim. And I miss him.
          Jim looks at her, moved and caught off-guard.

                                             JIM
                    I've missed you too.

                                             AURORA
                    I don't want to be angry anymore. I
                    can't be. We've come through too
                    much. No matter what you've done...
                    the fact is, I love you.
          Jim reaches out and takes her hand. She watches him
          intertwine his fingers with hers.
          Aurora gazes out at the stars - the endless shining sky that
          enfolds them. She looks at Jim and smiles.

          An orange sun rises over green hills. In the foreground the
          roofs of Homestead II's capital city glow in the dawn.
          At the city's edge, timeworn spacecraft sit on their landing
          gear around a grassy landing field.
          Colonists gather. They watch the sky expectantly...
          A new star shines on the horizon.
          The star grows into a white starship gleaming in the sun. The
          Excelsior sweeps over the field with a rumble of engines.
          The ship's hull is scorched and abraded from its cosmic
          crossing. But the lights shine, the engines throb, the
          landing gear receive the weight of the ship.
          The starship's gangway lowers. The doors open.
          CHILDREN run down the gangway. Children of all ages, of all
          races. Twenty of them, thirty. They point at the sun, at the
          clouds, laughing, wide-eyed in wonder.
          We move up the gangway, through the disembarking passengers.
          Behind the children: Teenagers. Adults in smaller numbers as
          they grow older. Finally a handful of gray-haired elders.

          Transformed by the wear and tear of a century's habitation.
          Paths worn into floors, furniture repaired or re-purposed.
          We move past vegetable gardens. Battered sweeper robots water
          the plantings. Window-washers till the soil.
          The OAK TREE towers a hundred feet tall over the Concourse.
          Its branches brush the skylight far above.
          We move past walls decorated with murals and carvings.
          At the Concourse Bar, Arthur is slicing vegetables. His
          timeworn uniform mended by hand.
          At the aft end of the Concourse, a high wall. Here a long
          list of dates is inscribed. The last date is the ship's
          landfall on Homestead II; the first, Jim's awakening. In
          between: an accelerating tally of births, deaths, marriages,
          catastrophes and achievements...a century of shipboard life.
          At the base of the wall we find a table like an altar, where
          a collection of artifacts is displayed:
          The meteor pried from the Excelsior's heart.
          Gus's worn shipcard, his picture still visible.
          A beautiful hand-bound book. In the Blink of an Eye: Our
          Lives Between the Stars, by Aurora Dunn. Beneath these
          printed words, a handwritten dedication: For Jim.
          In the center of it all, in the place of honor: the photo
          strip of Jim and Aurora from their first date.
          They laugh. They clown. She kisses him.
          Aurora looks into the camera's eye.
          Jim looks at Aurora.
