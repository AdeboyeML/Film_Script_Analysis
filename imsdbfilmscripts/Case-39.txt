          Pitch black. We hear FOOTSTEPS sneaking up an old wooden
          staircase. Two people moving as one.
                         
          Topping the stairs, they creep down the hall to the closed
          door that protects us. We can hear them behind it,
          whispering, bickering insanely, one shushing the other.
                         
          The squeak of a door knob slowly turning. The faint click of
          the latch. And the door inches open, throwing a razor-thin
          shaft of light into the darkness where it illuminates a
                         
                         FRIGHTENED EYE
                         
          As a ten-year-old GIRL sits up in bed. Dead tired. Staring
          at the two dark faces peering in at her.
                         
                          GIRL
           I can see you...
                         
          And the door closes, leaving us once more in total darkness.
          We can hear them bickering again as they shuffle away, their
          footsteps descending the stairs, fading into the uneasy
          silence of this old house...
                         
          INT. FIFTH GRADE CLASSROOM, LOS ANGELES - DAY
                         
          A young teacher (DARLA) chalks a lesson on a blackboard in a
          sun-drenched Los Angeles classroom.
                         
                          DARLA
           -- and we know from yesterday that the
           base of a triangle times half the height
           equals the area.
                         
          A girl in the back row raises her hand.

           Lucy's asleep again.
                         
          Darla puts down the chalk and comes up the aisle to where a
          slight, fair-skinned girl in a thrift shop dress sleeps head
          down on her desk. The girl from the opening scene. LUCY
          SHERIDAN. Darla stands over her with obvious concern. Puts
          a finger to her lips to quiet the giggles.
                         
                          DARLA
           Let her sleep.
                         
          She draws the shade. It drops a shadowbox on the sleeping
          girl.

          A former gang member sitting with his wife and troubled eight-
          year-old son. The MARTINEZ FAMILY. A family in crisis.
          Sitting opposite is an LA County social worker. Twenties.
          Attractive but overworked. EMILY.
                         
                          GANG MEMBER
           He would just go off, you know, start
           tearin' the place down. You didn't even
           know why he was doin' it half the time,
           you just got out of his way...

           Diego's learning from you...?
                         
          It's painful for him to hear that. He loves his son, quit
          the streets for him. Overcome by emotion, he nods yes.
                         
                          EMILY
           That really upsets you, doesn't it?
                         
          He wipes his eyes on his tattooed arm.
                         
                          GANG MEMBER
           Yeah. Cuz I mean I don't want him to be
           like me.
                         
          The boy looks at his father, has never seen him cry before.
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
                         
          Outside the conference room, Emily musses the boy's hair.
                         
                          EMILY
           A whole week without skipping school? Is
           that true?
                         
          He smiles, nods. A glimpse of the boy he might have been.
                         
                          EMILY
           That's the last time I make a bet with
           you.
           (to his parents)
           See you guys next week.
                         
          The Martinez family heads down the hall, Diego lagging
          behind. Emily watches with guarded optimism, knowing their
          chances. Then turns to the NEXT FAMILY, welcoming the
                         BELEAGUERED MOTHER:
           3.

          The hurried opening and closing of files reveals PHOTOS of
          abused children. Bruises. Cuts. Broken bones. Emily
          trying to locate a single case amid the stacks and clutter on
          her desk. An angry mother SCREAMING at her on the phone:
                         
                          EMILY
           No one is trying to steal your child,
           they found bruises and cigarette burns --
           Mrs Lynch, I read the medical report --
           well, if you feel you need legal
           representation that's perfectly within
           your rights...
                         
          A flurry of obscenities followed by a dial tone. Emily puts
          the phone down. Sighs wearily.
                         
           WAYNE (O.S.)
           One less Christmas card for Emily.
                         
          Her supervisor WAYNE, forties, gay, leaning in the doorway.

                          EMILY
           No, absolutely not, look at this, Wayne,

           Sorry, Em, we all are.
                         
          He walks off. Emily shoves the new file onto the shelf above
          her desk. Looks at it guiltily. Takes it down again.
          Handwritten on the front: SHERIDAN, LUCY.
                         
          She opens it. A school portrait of ten-year-old Lucy clipped
          to the preliminary report. The sad face draws Emily in.
                         
          EXT. WILSHIRE BLVD - DAY
                         
          An old VOLVO WAGON skirts rush hour traffic on Wilshire.
          Faded red paint. Ski rack on the roof. An ancient
          bumpersticker says Educate.

          IPod jacked into the car stereo playing hip alternative
          MUSIC, Emily leans on an elbow as she drives, not crazy about
          L.A. but at ease with herself.
                         
          EXT. EMILY'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Emily's red Volvo wagon turns in the drive of a single-person
          home she rents in a working-class neighborhood.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Cozy. Her haven. Light colors offset dark hardwood floors.
          Emily comes in, stack of files under her arm. Tired. Long
          day. Drops the files in a chair. Sprinkles some food in a
          fish tank. Referees through the glass.
                         
                          EMILY
           Don't fight. Hey, that's his.
                         
          Turns on the tv. World news. Violence. People suffering.
          Turns it off. Puts on some quiet music. Hits play on her
          answering machine as she flops down barefoot on the sofa with
          a magazine, peeling an orange, decompressing.

                          DOUG'S VOICE
           Exhausted, her career path questionable,
           her faith in mankind shaken, she resisted
           her tendency toward introspection and
           went to have a drink with her friend
           Doug.
                         
          BEEP. Emily gives a tired sigh. Faint smile under it.
                         
          INT. BAR - NIGHT
                         
          Noisy, trendy downtown bar. Professional type on a bar
          stool. Thirties. Handsome. DOUG. He laughs when he sees
          Emily.

                          EMILY
           Be honest. The whole psychology thing,
           it's just about scoring chicks, isn't it?
                         
                          DOUG
           Regrettably, yes.
                         
          They share a laugh. He gestures to the bartender for another
          beer.
                         
                          EMILY

                          DOUG
           That you have a four-year degree and make

           I sit there talking to these families,
           you know, like I'm some expert. My
           family's a train wreck. I mean, I had
           this moment today where I realized I
           might be totally full of it.
                         
                          DOUG
           Everybody's full of it. In the end
           you're a number to call for people who
           don't have anyone else. There's no way
           that's bad.
                         
          Emily nods, appreciates that. Recognizes a girl going by in
          the crowd. A friend from school. Well-dressed. Career-
          oriented. The track Emily might be on if she weren't a
          social worker.

          Emily nods okay. The girl departs. Emily's beer arrives.
          Doug hands it to her.
                         
                          DOUG
           So anyway, I've done some soul searching
           and I just want to say that if a full-on
           relationship feels like too much right
           now, I'd be willing to consider a purely
           physical one.

           I'm sure I would, I just...
                         
          Hard to explain. Doug saves her the trouble.

           don't have anything left.
                         
          Emily nods yeah, leans in closer, the friendly banter giving
          way to a moment of real sincerity.
                         
                          EMILY
           If it were anyone, it'd be you.
                         
          They exchange a look then Doug clinks his glass against hers.
          And as they drink together after a long day, more than
          friends, less than lovers...

          of appetite. Sleeping at school..."
                         
          Her gaze returns to Lucy's photo. Sadly, under her breath:

          EXT. SHERIDAN HOUSE - DAY
                         
          A dark, rundown family home on a once-prosperous cul de sac.
          Emily pulls up. Gets out. Checks that she has the right
          address. Halfway up the walk something stops her dead in her
                         TRACKS -
                         
          A WOMAN'S FACE
                         
          staring at her through one of the lacy white curtains
          upstairs. Ghostly pale. Gone as soon as she sees it. Emily
          stands frozen for a moment. Walks on.
                         
          She reaches to knock on the door and it opens abruptly, the
          security chain snapping taut. A woman's voice growls at her
          from the darkness inside:
                         
                          WOMAN'S VOICE

           spoke on the phone...?
                         
          Peering through the crack is the pallid, bony face from the
          upstairs window. Lucy's mother. MARGARET SHERIDAN.

          The door closes in Emily's face. What the hell? Then we
          hear the chain unlock. It opens again.
           8.
                         
          And we get our first good look at Lucy's mother. Gaunt.
          Pale. Dark rings under her eyes. She steps aside, not
          welcoming Emily in, merely allowing her to enter.
                         
          INT. SHERIDAN HOUSE - DAY
                         
          It's dark, the curtains drawn. Margaret twitches one open in
          begrudging courtesy. The house is tidy but sad, steeped in a
          kind of puritanical gloom. Lucy peers down through the
          upstairs banister, anxious, unsure what's going on. Emily
          sees her, smiles.
                         
                          EMILY
           Come down, I'd like to meet you.
                         
          Lucy hesitates, sensing her mother's disapproval. Comes
          slowly down the stairs. Emily shakes her hand.

          Emily, file in hand, trying to project professionalism in an
          arm chair that tilts to one side. Margaret and Lucy sitting
          opposite on the sofa.

                          EMILY
           Because we've found it's more beneficial

           Not if I don't know where he is.
                         
          Just then we hear a POWER TOOL go on in the basement. Emily,
          sensing the lie, indicates the floor.
                         
                          EMILY

           Would you ask him?
                         
          Margaret weighs Emily's resolve, gives Lucy a cautionary
          glance then exits. We hear her open a door and holler into
          the basement over the noise of the power tool.
                         
           MARGARET (O.S.)

           MARGARET (O.S.)
           That lady's here. From the state. She

          We hear an angry unintelligible reply.

           I already told her, she wants to anyway.
                         
          We hear the power tool get thrown aside. FOOTSTEPS pounding
          up the cellar stairs. Emily's and Lucy's faces reflect the
          same simple fear. Their eyes meet.
                         
                          EMILY
           It'll be okay.
                         
          Lucy not so sure. The FOOTSTEPS are upon them. EDWARD
          SHERIDAN makes his entrance. A menacing man with a gaunt
          face and dark deep-set eyes. Emily holds out her hand.

          Edward forgoes the handshake, his contempt obvious. Sits
          beside Lucy on the sofa. Margaret sits on the other side.
          Lucy tenses, trapped between them. Emily speaks with
          kindness and composure. Hostile encounters part of the job.
                         
                          EMILY
           I'm here today because Lucy's school is
           concerned about changes they're seeing in
           her academic performance. The kinds of
           changes they're seeing are often
           associated with family problems.
                         
          Edward leans over and whispers something caustic in
          Margaret's ear.
                         
                          MARGARET

                          EMILY
           That's just it, many times a family won't
           even know they're having problems until
           it's too late. That's where we come in.
           We help families communicate and learn
           healthier ways of resolving conflict.
                         
          Edward whispers again in Margaret's ear.
                         
                          MARGARET
           Eddie says we don't need your help.
                         
                          EMILY
           Mr Sheridan, is there some reason you
           won't speak to me directly?
                         
          Edward just stares at her.

           won't speak to me directly?
                         
          Margaret nods, gives Edward a look as though for permission.
                         
                          MARGARET
           Eddie doesn't like speakin' out of anger.
                         
          Emily does well to hide her fear. Refusing to be
          intimidated, she engages Edward's stare. A battle of wills.
          But his gaze has a murderous intensity she can't match. She
          looks down, shuffling papers. Battle lost.

           They really are God's miracles. Day she

           other stuff takes care of itself.
                         
          Wayne nods his agreement. Edward puts his arm around Lucy

           Don't tell me you're buying this daddy's

           So they're overcompensating a little.

          Emily walks with Lucy, looking for a way in.
                         
                          EMILY
           I knew someone at school named Lucy, she
           was a writer. Do you ever write? I do
           sometimes, it helps me sort out how I'm
           feeling.
                         
          Lucy doesn't take the bait. She stops for a drink at a water
          fountain. Emily bends for a sip after. Misfires. As she
          wipes her face, embarrassed:
                         
                          EMILY
           Okay, I just shot like a gallon of water
           up my nose. So much for establishing
           trust.
                         
          Lucy smiles, for the first time. It's the opening Emily was
          looking for. Maintaining that precious eye contact,
                         DEEPENING IT:

           They hate me.
                         
          She lowers her head in shame, tears rolling down.
                         
                          EMILY
           I'm sure they don't hate you.
                         
                          LUCY
           They do. I hear them. They go in the
           cellar and talk.
                         
                          EMILY
           What do they talk about?

          Emily's mouth falls open.
                         
                          EMILY
           You've heard them say that?
                         
          Lucy nods. As Emily registers this in quiet horror...
                         
          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
                         
          A tape recorder is running. Emily and Wayne alone with Lucy.
          She's hesitant to speak, naturally distrustful.
                         
                          EMILY
           It's okay. You can tell him. He's on

           going to hurt you?
                         
          Nobody sees what Lucy sees at this moment. Edward glaring in
          at her through the window. Lucy looks at Wayne, shakes her
          head. Wayne looks at Emily, case closed.

          Emily watches in agony as the Sheridan family steps into the
          elevator. Parent on each side, Lucy gives her one last
          pleading look then the elevator doors close and she's gone.

                          EMILY
           She doesn't trust anybody. You think I
           made it up?
                         
                          WAYNE
           I think you'd do just about anything you
           had to do to help a child you thought was
           at risk. Here are the facts, Emily.
           They haven't laid a finger on her that we
           can tell. And we have no proof they
           intend to. Meanwhile on your desk right
           now are thirty-plus cases of actionable
           abuse. What about those?
                         
                          EMILY
           I'm not giving up on her, Wayne.

           Yes, you are, you're leaving this alone.
                         
          A look that says he means it.
                         
                          EMILY
           I hope you can live with a dead child on
           your conscience.

                          (HURT)
           That's a little unfair, don't you think?
           I care about these kids as much as you
           do, but we can't go around yanking them
           out of their homes on a hunch. Parents,
           even bad ones, have rights, that's how
           the laws of this great land are written.
                         
          Emily gives a resigned nod, backing away from him, from the
          job, all of it.
                         
                          EMILY
           So that's it? We let kids get killed
           until they rewrite the goddamn laws?
                         
          She exits before he can answer, doesn't want to hear it.

           letter from Sandy Hutchinson...
                         
          She drops Lucy's file on his desk. Whatever Barron was going
          to say is no longer relevant. Soberly, after a pause:
                         
                          BARRON
           Well, it's sitting in front of me which
           means our good friend Wayne thinks it
           fails to meet the criteria for child
           endangerment and has told you in no
           uncertain terms to leave it alone...?

          Tense beat. The need for privacy now apparent, Barron gets
          up and closes his door. Sits down at his desk again.

                          BARRON
           Sickening as that is, you're a part of
           the system that handles those situations,
           I'm not.

                          BARRON
           Okay. No bullshit. Give me evidence of

          He nods - no kidding, heads off. Emily comes over and sits
          on Lucy's bed. Strokes her hair.

          No frills, purely functional housing. Emily comes up the
          steps with Lucy and knocks. The COORDINATOR answers. A kind
          but beleagured-looking woman of fifty, who is surprised to
          see them.

          Through the windshield Lucy watches Emily on a pay phone
          outside a convenience store. Her back is to us but you can
          see she's arguing with someone, scratching addresses off a
          typed list with a ballpoint.

          Heartbreaking. Emily can't lie. She turns off the engine
          and leans back with a sigh. Lucy's silence is a plea for
          rescue.

          A ten-year-old girl stranded at a convenience store, suitcase

           I know what it feels like to be that age
           and be unwanted. It's terrifying. She
           needs to be with someone she trusts; she
           trusts me. So much of our time is spent
           negotiating red tape, I think if we just
           look at the situation - this one
           situation, this one child - it's clear
           what's best for her.

          They stop in the doorway. A small office in which Emily has
          made space for a bureau and a bed. Professional books and
          backup case files pushed aside on a shelf.

          Beneath the measured tone Emily's pain is revealed, raw and
          untouchable, her entire life a rebellion against it. She
          opens Lucy's suitcase on the bed. Pauses, remembering
          something.

          the ceiling.
                         
          She explores the room, inspecting various personal items -
          aftershave, glasses, hair brush - looking for clues to their
          madness.
                         
          An ALARM CLOCK with a cracked crystal face. She picks it up
          and it GOES OFF in her hand. Gives her a scare. She puts it
          down. Sees something out the bedroom window. Steps closer.
          Parts the curtains.
                         
          In the backyard, by the garden shed, a long rectangular hole
          has been dug. A SHALLOW GRAVE filling with leaves. Edward's
          handiwork. Emily's seen enough, heads for the door.

          old oak bureau perhaps? - has been dragged repeatedly across
          the room.
                         
          Emily comes over and looks behind the door and sees, on the

          screwed hastily, crookedly, into the wood. She closes the

          the door, a wheelless caster bracket leaving another long
          scratch in the hardwood. And it's clear at this point what
          the deadbolts and bureau add up to -

          aside. Opens the deadbolts. And as the door swings open she
          is looking straight down the hall at

           Sometimes when our parents aren't getting
           along it's better if they don't see each
           other for a while, that's what a
           `restraining order' does...

          Emily looks in, waiting with other parents. Lucy sees her in
          the window and sneaks her a little wave. Emily smiles and
          holds up a hand that says, hi, hon. It's clear from these
          gestures how close they've gotten.
                         
           TIME CUT TO:

           It's good, I just wish I thought it was
           me making the difference.

           I went by the house. I think her mom and
           dad were barricading themselves in their
           room at night. How sick is that?
                         
                          DOUG
           Hatred and fear are part of the same
           pathology - oh, but I forgot, you don't
           think they're crazy.

           Okay?
                         
          Lucy nods, apprehensive, but she's ready to face it. Emily
          hugs her.
                         
                          EMILY
           This is your new beginning.
                         
          Lucy gets out. Pauses on the sidewalk.

          Emily draws grim looks as she crosses the common area. A
          pall hanging over the entire department. The first person
          she walks past says:

           Got it.
                         
          She comes past Wayne's office. Empty. A coworker points
          over toward Emily's cubicle - he's there. She goes over.
          Wayne's inside, grave-faced, looking for a file. He finds it
          on the shelf. A photo of eight-year-old DIEGO clipped inside
          the cover. The boy we met earlier.
                         
                          EMILY

           We don't know why yet, but... he killed
           his mother and father last night.

          A police perimeter around a small house in a tough low-income
          neighborhood. Cops and crime scene investigators on the
          scene. Local news media broadcasting live. A couple of news
          choppers hovering overhead.
                         
          Emily pulls up, jumps out of her car. Mike Barron waves off
          the uniformed officer who moves to intercept her as she comes
          up the walkway to the house.

          The master bedroom. A bloodbath.

           An eight-year-old did this? There's no

           Kid was climbing the walls.
                         
          Barron turns to the window and - WHAM! - AN ATTACK DOG HITS
          THE GLASS RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIS FACE. Barron recoils with a
          yelp. Then, embarrassed, eyes the TRIO OF BATTLE-SCARRED PIT
          BULLS prowling the chainlink-fenced backyard.

          sat down next to a pretty stranger who hasn't yet noticed

          He throws the Q-tip in the toilet. Hits the flush lever.
          Watches the hornet spiral away. Gone.
                         
          Stares at the empty bowl. Did I just imagine that?
                         
          Shaken, he turns to the sink. Wedges his head under the tap
          and runs water into his ear.
                         
          Straightens and looks at himself in the mirror, toweling his
          face, trying to impose rational thought on the situation.
          But as the water spills from his ear, down his neck, onto his
          shirt, it brings with it -
                         
          TWO MORE LIVE HORNETS, half drowned.
                         
          With a yelp Doug swipes them from his shirt. Crushes them
          underfoot. Terrified, but clinging to rational thought a
          moment longer, he turns his head sideways to the mirror,
          parts his hair, and sees -

           FUCK!
                         
          Rationality goes out the window. He flails at them with the
          towel. Swats them dead. Picks them up and drops them in the
          toilet. Studies the last one for a moment. Its little legs
          twitching. Drops it in. Flushes.
                         
          A false respite. And a brief one. Because as the FLUSHING
          NOISE FADES he can hear an ominous DEEP BUZZING SOUND RISING.
                         
          It's coming from behind him. He turns to have a look.
          Nothing there. Bare wall.
                         
          But it's strange: the BUZZING IS STILL BEHIND HIM.
                         
          With dawning horror Doug turns and checks his back in the
          mirror, sees

          Whimpering like a child, he undoes the buttons of his shirt,
          taking it off as delicately as possible. Slipping his arms
          gently from the sleeves.
                         
          Holding it by the collar, he takes two quick steps and tosses
          it in the shower. Slams the glass door, seals the crack with
          towels. And watches the hornets fly around in the glass
          enclosure, BUZZING FURIOUSLY, bouncing off the glass.
                         
          But as he backpedals he realizes the FURIOUS BUZZING is too
          close, too loud and too deep, to be coming from the shower
          over there. A sharp pain in his head confirms it. He GROANS
          and brings a hand to his ear as something awful happens
          inside.
                         
          The BUZZING in his right ear spreads to his left - LOUDER,
          ANGRIER, its sources multiplying. Disoriented, he stumbles
          backwards with an AGONIZING SCREAM. Catches sight of himself
          in the mirror, the terror of the moment on his face. This
          can't be happening.
                         
          And now the nightmare takes a devilish turn. Looking at
          himself in the mirror, he sees -
                         
          HORNETS START CRAWLING FROM HIS NOSE. FROM BETWEEN HIS LIPS.
          FROM UNDER HIS EYELIDS. THE BUZZING NOW UNBEARABLY LOUD. AN
          ENTIRE SWARM RAGING INSIDE HIS SKULL, FIGHTING ITS WAY OUT!
                         
          Doug grabs his head in both hands and starts shaking it,
          trying to shake away the madness inside. But the hornets
          keep coming, COUGHED UP IN CLUMPS as he gasps for air.
          They're all over him, stinging his tongue, his eyes.
                         
          He goes berserk and starts SMASHING HIS HEAD against the
          wall, the door, the edge of the sink, anything he can find,
          opening a deep gash in his forehead, smashing it harder and
          harder because the BUZZING WON'T STOP, cracking his skull,
          SCREAMING HYSTERICALLY, pitching his head violently forwards
          and backwards like some demon-possessed heavy metal fanatic.
                         
          It's a grotesque display that ends on a sickening note when,
          with one particularly violent head jerk, he snaps his own
          neck - CRACK!!! He sinks to the floor, head askew,
          astonished look on his face.
                         
          And there he sits, paralyzed, eyes locked on the tv in the
          living room where football highlights play in silence. Fully
          conscious as the hornets fight their way back into his ears,
          nose, and mouth - a pilgrimage back to the mind that bore
          them.

          INT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY
                         
          A CLERK stops in an aisle, hands Emily a DEADBOLT from a
          shelf.
                         
                          HARDWARE CLERK
           That what you're looking for?
                         
                          EMILY
                          (NODS)
           Thanks.
                         
          He walks off. Emily weighs the deadbolt in hand. Puts it
          down and picks up the next larger size. Grabs a second one
          just to be safe. A third for good measure.
                         
          INT. LUCY'S ROOM, EMILY'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          With urgency Emily removes all her backup files from the
          shelf in Lucy's room. Dropping them in banker's boxes.
          Stops on Diego's. Eyes his photo. Drops it in. Grabs the
          office phone, boxes it with the files.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Emily unplugs the phone in the kitchen. Unplugs the one by
          the sofa.
                         
          Opens the closet and tosses the phones inside with the
          banker's boxes she put there. Closes the door. Locks it.
          Hides the key.
                         
          Just then, a FLASHING RED LIGHT draws her gaze to the window -
                         
          A SCHOOL BUS
                         
          stopping at the end of the block. Emily crosses to the
          window, watching as
                         
                         LUCY
                         
          gets off and comes up the sidewalk toward the house. Sensing
          Emily's stare, she stops and meets it. Waves, testing the
          waters. Emily waves back but it's a hollow gesture. Lucy's
          smile fades, knowing this as she continues toward the house.
           69.
                         
                         
          In a sudden panic Emily goes into the kitchen, grabs one of
          the knives. Eyes the blade, forced to contemplate the
          unthinkable - its use as a weapon, self-defense.
                         
          She comes into the living room, holding it. Catches sight of
          herself in the mirror. A jarring image:
                         
          Sweet Emily Jennings with a butcher's knife in her hand.
                         
          The sound of LUCY'S FOOTSTEPS on the front steps breaks the
          spell.
                         
          Emily hides the knife behind the fish tank. No good, you can
          see it through the glass.
                         
          We hear LUCY'S KEY IN THE LOCK.
                         
          Emily grabs the knife. It's in her hand as the door CLICKS
          open, until the last second when she tosses it under a sofa
          pillow.
                         
          Lucy enters. Shy. Innocent. A ten-year-old home from
          school.
                         
                          LUCY
           Hi.
                         
          Emily returns a plastic smile.
                         
                          EMILY
           Hi.
                         
                          LUCY
           You weren't there so I took the bus.
                         
                          EMILY
           Sorry, work - lost track of time.
                         
                          LUCY
           It's okay, I know how busy you are.
                         
          Emily watches unnerved as Lucy crosses to the sofa, to the
          very pillow where she hid the butcher's knife, and sits down
          to untie her shoes. The point of the knife is almost
          touching her leg. If she moves at all, it will cut the skin.
                         
                          LUCY
           Doesn't matter anyway, the bus stops
           right at the end of the street. So I can
           always get home, whether you're there or
           not.
           70.
                         
                         
                          EMILY
           Lucky.
                         
          Lucy nods then pauses and looks at the pillow, or appears to,
          but she is actually looking at the end table.
                         
                          LUCY
           Where's the phone?
                         
                          EMILY
           Oh, it wasn't working...
                         
          Lucy nods oh. Finishes untying her shoes then gets up and
          walks into the kitchen, checks the wall, turns to Emily.
                         
                          LUCY
           Wow. That one, too.
                         
          Emily, caught in a lie, says nothing.
                         
                          LUCY
           Can I have a shower? We had gym today...
                         
          Emily nods. Lucy heads into the bathroom. Pauses at the
          door, back turned.
                         
                          LUCY
           Are they being nice to her?
                         
                          EMILY
           Who?
                         
                          LUCY
           My mother.
                         
          She turns for Emily's reaction.
                         
                          EMILY
           How - how would I know that?
                         
                          LUCY
           I thought you said you were going to see
           her.
                         
                          EMILY
           I never said that.
                         
          Lucy frowns. A bewilderment that seems genuine.
                         
                          LUCY
           Hm. I must have dreamt it.
                         
          Goes into the bathroom. Closes the door.
           71.
                         
                         
          INT. EMILY'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Ear pressed to the bathroom door, Emily listens to the
          RUNNING WATER: Lucy taking a shower.
                         
          She goes to the closet, unlocks it. Grabs one of the phones.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S KITCHEN - DAY
                         
          It sounds like EMILY'S VOICE is coming from the fridge until
          we sweep past it to see her crouching by a phone jack in the
          corner. Whispering.
                         
                          EMILY
           I don't care, Robin, anywhere. Just find
           somewhere that will take her. Tonight.
           I don't want this girl in my house.
                         
          Emily unplugs the phone. And just then hears a SOFT BREATH
          behind her. Oh shit. Slowly turns.
                         
          LUCY IN A BATH ROBE BEHIND HER.
                         
          Hair dripping wet. A chilling stare. How much did she hear?
          Lucy walks out. We hear her bedroom door close.
                         
          Emily crouched in the corner, holding the phone, terrified at
          the thought of what's in store.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          THE HEAD OF A TURNING SCREW - Emily installing a DEADBOLT on
          her door in the middle of the night.
                         
          It's the third lock, the other two already in place. Hands
          trembling, she lines up the last screw. It slips from her
          fingers. ROLLS UNDER THE DOOR.
                         
          She cracks opens the door. Reaches to grab it and lets out a
          SHRIEK, recoiling -
                         
                         FEET
                         
          standing just outside her door.
                         
          LUCY, IN PAJAMAS, HOLDING THE SCREW
                         
          She hands it back to Emily, making no overt acknowledgement
          of it.
                         
                          LUCY
           Good night.
           72.
                         
                         
          She walks down the hallway to her bedroom.
                         
          As soon as Lucy's door closes, Emily closes hers and goes
          back to work, doublespeed. Winds that last screw into the
          wood and then slides-to the heavy bolts.
                         
          CLUNK. CLUNK. CLUNK.
                         
          Scooting backwards, she sits against the bed, wide-eyed with
          terror, screwdriver clutched in her fist like a stabbing
          weapon.
                         
          EXT. OLD STONE CHURCH - DAY
                         
          A bell TOLLS in a steeple.
                         
          Down below, Emily is going against the tide, walking up the
          steps past CHURCHGOERS who are coming down after morning
          mass. Halfway up, she runs into Mike Barron and his wife and
          son. It's awkward, more for her than him.
                         
                          BARRON
           Emily...?
                         
                          EMILY
           Mike.
                         
          EXT. CHURCH PARK - DAY
                         
          Sitting on a bench in a park that occupies the shadow of the
          old stone church, Emily and Mike talk privately. His wife
          pushing his young son on a playground swing.
                         
                          EMILY
           `No such thing as a bad kid, only bad
           parents.' I always believed that. It's
           a lie. Her parents aren't crazy.
                         
                          BARRON
           You wanna end up where they did keep
           talking like this.
           (off her look)
           I'm not judging you. You're grieving for
           Doug and you're still confused about what
           Diego did.
                         
                          EMILY
           Aren't you?
                         
                          BARRON
           Diego grew up in a bad home, he saw
           violence and he repeated it, that's the
           cycle, you know that better than anyone.
           73.
                         
                         
                          EMILY
           Why did she lie about calling him?
                         
                          BARRON
           `Cause she's a liar, that doesn't mean
           she made him do it. Look, let me tell
           you what Lucy is. Lucy is a damaged
           child, a deceitful child, a manipulative
           child. But a damaged, deceitful,
           manipulative child is not a demon. Ask
           my brother-in-law, he's got a couple of
           `em.
                         
          Barron stands from the bench.
                         
                          EMILY
           Mike, you know I'm not crazy. Don't run
           away from something just because it
           scares you.
                         
          His concern edges toward sadness. He indicates the church.
                         
                          BARRON
           I stopped you on the steps. I think
           maybe you oughta go all the way in.
                         
          Walks off to rejoin his wife and son. Emily alone on a bench
          in the shadow of a church.
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GROUP THERAPY - DAY
                         
          The circle of abused children. Lucy among them, a happy
          participant. Nancy filling in for Doug.
                         
          It's EMILY'S POV - as she spies on Lucy through the window,
          second-guessing herself for a moment.
                         
          Session over, Nancy dismisses the group with a smile and
          theatrical applause.
                         
          Emily watches Lucy cross the room. At the coat rack, she
          whispers something to another girl. The veil of Lucy's hair
          partially obscures her profile, but through that veil Emily
          sees something chilling. For a moment, a moment so fleeting
          it might just be a trick of the eyes -
                         
          LUCY'S LIPS APPEAR THICKER, MORE MASCULINE, SPEAKING CAUSTIC
          WORDS THAT HOLD THE OTHER GIRL CAPTIVE.
                         
          Emily draws a sharp inward breath. Lucy, feeling Emily's
          stare now, turns to meet it. Her SWEET INNOCENT GIRL LIPS
          widening into a smile.
           74.
                         
                         
          But Emily knows what she saw. She throws open the door and
          rushes in.
                         
          INT. GROUP THERAPY ROOM - DAY
                         
          Grabs Lucy by the arm and yanks her bodily from the room.
          This, to the amazement of Nancy, the other children -
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GROUP THERAPY - DAY
                         
          - and to the shock of the other PARENTS waiting outside.
          Nancy comes after her in a fury. Runs her down. Erupts.
                         
                          NANCY
           Who do you think you are barging in there
           like that?!
                         
                          EMILY
           I don't want her in group anymore, I
           don't want her around the other kids.
                         
                          NANCY
           Well that's not your decision, is it?!
                         
          Emily opens her mouth to reply, but Lucy beats her to the
          punch.
                         
                          LUCY
           It's okay, Nancy, Emily's been under a
           lot of stress lately, but she's really
           nice to me and I hope I can stay with her
           a really long time.
                         
          Nancy, disarmed by the glowing praise, turns back to Emily.
                         
                          NANCY
           We'll talk about this later.
                         
          Storms off.
                         
                          LUCY
           See you next week, Nancy.
                         
          Nancy doesn't hear, busily reassuring parents, damage
          control. Emily and Lucy arrive at the elevator. Emily hits
          the button.
                         
                          EMILY
           You're never going back there.
                         
                          LUCY
           Why, Emily?
           75.
                         
                         
          Emily says nothing. Lucy keeps asking the same question, in
          the exact same intonation, as Emily ignores her:
                         
                          LUCY
           Why, Emily? Why, Emily? Why, Emily?
                         
          DING. The doors open.
                         
          INT. ELEVATOR - DAY
                         
          Emily and Lucy step in. The door closes. Lucy continuing
          her verbal assault as they start to descend:
                         
                          LUCY
           Why, Emily? Why, Emily?
                         
          Suddenly the ELEVATOR LURCHES TO A VIOLENT STOP. It buckles
          Emily's knees. She is terrified, practically
          hyperventilating.
                         
                          EMILY
           W-w-what's happening - ?!
                         
          Lucy has gotten her attention.
                         
                          LUCY
           Can I go back to group next week?
                         
                          EMILY
           You're never going back there!
                         
          Lucy looks at her as one regards a small dumb animal. Then
          looks up at the ceiling.
                         
                          LUCY
           Are you sure?
                         
          Horror as Emily realizes what she's thinking. We hear the
          first CABLE SNAP above them. In the CREAKING HUSH that
                         FOLLOWS:
                         
                          EMILY
           No...
                         
          The second CABLE SNAPS. The elevator goes into a HELLISH
          FREE FALL.
                         
          The acceleration is dizzying.
                         
          Emily clutches the rail with both hands, SCREAMING as the
          elevator goes cannonballing down the shaft. Lucy indifferent
          as they plummet toward certain death.
           76.
                         
                         
          The floor indicator light races toward L, the car shuddering
          violently, the noise deafening. It's a horrible way to die.
                         
          Emily closes her eyes in anticipation of impact. And in the
          sudden BLACKNESS there's no noise at all. Just a soft,
                         DISTINCT
                         
          DING.
                         
          A breathless pause then Emily opens her eyes. And sees the
          elevator is no longer falling. Never was. The doors glide
          open to the first floor lobby.
                         
          Lucy gives her a quiet look and strolls out. A businessman
          steps into the elevator, watching bewildered as Emily
          releases her white-knuckled grip on the railing and staggers
          out, so badly shaken she can barely stand...
                         
          INT. EMILY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Fish swim languidly in the tank. It's after midnight. We're
          looking down the darkened hall at Emily's closed bedroom
          door.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Emily, in a coat and shoes, packing a suitcase. Snaps it
          quietly shut. Looks over at the barricaded door. Draws a
          tense breath.
                         
          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
                         
          From down the hall we hear the DEADBOLTS SLIDE QUIETLY OPEN.
                         
          The door opens a crack.
                         
          EMILY'S TERRIFIED FACE peers out. Making sure the hall is
          empty.
                         
          She steps out, suitcase in hand.
                         
          Tiptoes down the hall. Quietly as possible as she comes past
          Lucy's door. It's open a crack. The room pitch black
          inside. Emily steps closer, breath held. Peers in through
          the little crack. Sees -
                         
          LUCY ASLEEP IN BED.
                         
          But suddenly her EYES SNAP OPEN. Her face horizontal on the
          pillow.
                         
                          LUCY
           I can see you.
           77.
                         
                         
          Emily backs away. Goes quickly to the front door.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S CAR - NIGHT
                         
          Emily throws the suitcase in the trunk. Slams it shut.
          Comes around to the driver's side door. Jumps in. Closes
          the door. And gets the scare of her life.
                         
          LUCY IS SITTING IN THE PASSENGER SEAT!
                         
          Emily recoils with a SCREAM, throwing her body against the
          window behind her. Lucy sits there, silent, betrayed.
                         
          It's too much for Emily. She breaks down. Buries her face
          in her hands and sobs.
                         
          Lucy, after a moment, takes a brush from Emily's bag and
          starts lovingly brushing her hair.
                         
          Emily slowly lifts her head, resigning herself to this latest
          horror. She sits zombie-like behind the wheel, tears
          streaming as Lucy tugs gently at the snarls, playing mommy.
                         
                          LUCY
           Don't be sad. This is your new
           beginning.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S CUBICLE - DAY
                         
          Unopened mail and new case files piling up. Emily looks
          terrible, phone to ear, getting SCREAMED at, sworn at,
          interrupted every time she tries to speak.
                         
                          EMILY
           Mrs Lynch, I told you - will you let -
           that's not what I said - no, I did not -
           you never sent me the - Mrs Lynch - will
           you let me respond? - will you let me -
           Mrs Lynch - will you let -
                         
          Emily can't take it anymore. She unloads.
                         
                          EMILY
           SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU MISERABLE MISERABLE
           WOMAN BEFORE I GET IN MY CAR AND COME
           OVER THERE AND BEAT YOUR ASS LIKE YOU
           BEAT YOUR SON! I HAVE YOUR ADDRESS!
           THINK ABOUT THAT NEXT TIME YOU CALL AND
           SWEAR AT ME! I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE!
                         
          Slams the phone down. Sits there looking rather dazed.
          Wayne arrives, dazed in a different way, having overheard.
           78.
                         
                         
                          WAYNE
           Um, so, I notice you haven't taken any
           personal days. Come on, you look like
           crap, go home.
                         
          Emily levels a withering stare.
                         
                          EMILY
           I don't want to go home.
                         
          EXT. LOS ANGELES APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
                         
          Emily knocking on a door in an outside hallway. It opens.
          It's the girl from the bar. BECCA. The friend. Not
          expecting her.
                         
                          BECCA
           Emily...
                         
          INT. BECCA'S APARTMENT - DAY
                         
          Emily, disheveled, five days without sleep, doing her best to
          appear rational.
                         
                          EMILY
           I know I haven't been a great friend
           lately, but... do you think maybe I could
           crash here for a couple of nights?
                         
                          BECCA
           Sure, when?
                         
                          EMILY
           Tonight and tomorrow.
                         
          Becca draws air through her teeth, pained by her predicament.
                         
                          BECCA
           Em, any other weekend you know I'd say
           yes, but I just met this guy and he's
           coming over tonight like for the night
           and it might be, you know, kinda weird.
                         
          Emily nods. And there's nothing more to be said.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Stormy night. Heavy rain. High winds. The trees, thrashing
          outside the window, backlit by a streetlight, cast OMINOUS
          SHADOWS on the walls of the bedroom.
                         
          Emily huddles in the corner, wrapped in a blanket, clutching
          the screwdriver.
           79.
                         
                         
          There is a KNOCK on the bedroom door. Emily's EYES JERK WIDE
          OPEN. She looks at the door, but doesn't answer.
                         
          After a moment, Lucy's voice, innocent, afraid -
                         
           LUCY (O.S.)
           Emily...? Can I come in? I'm scared...
                         
          Emily says nothing. Heart racing. There's another KNOCK. A
          little louder.
                         
           LUCY (O.S.)
           Emily? Please? I know you're in there,
           please...?
                         
          Emily says nothing. Lucy starts pounding on the door.
                         
           LUCY (O.S.)
           Please, Emily...
                         
          SILENCE.
                         
          Emily listening, barely breathing. Is that it? Is she gone?
                         
          And then suddenly - WHAM! - WHAM! - WHAM! - the pounding
          turns VIOLENT, practically shaking the door off its hinges.
          Far too violent for a little girl.
                         
          Emily wedges herself into the corner, absolutely petrified.
          There is something very strong and very angry on the other
          side of that door, SHRIEKING in the voice of a child -
                         
           LUCY (O.S.)
           LET ME IN!
                         
          WHAM - WHAM - WHAM - WHAM - WHAM - WHAM!
                         
           LUCY (O.S.)
           LET ME IN!
                         
          WHAM - WHAM - WHAM - WHAM - WHAM - WHAM! The door getting
          absolutely pummeled, looking like it might splinter from the
          force. And it's so intense that it's almost surreal what
          Emily is seeing. Lucy's voice eerily monotone, the words
          coming inhumanly fast like some auctioneer from hell -
                         
           LUCY (O.S.)
           Let me in, let me in, let me in, let me
           in, let me in, let me in, let me in, let
           me in, let me in, let me in...
           80.
                         
                         
          Relentless. Tormenting Emily. Until she can't take it
          anymore. And she SCREAMS as loud as she can, half cursing,
          half begging, the veins standing out in her neck -
                         
                          EMILY
           LEAVE ME ALONE!!!
                         
          And the POUNDING STOPS DEAD. All we hear is the rain
          drumming on the roof. And Emily's QUICK TERRIFIED BREATHS as
          she stares at the door wondering what's next.
                         
          But there's nothing. Just the shadows dancing on the walls.
          It appears the nightmare is over for now.
                         
          But not quite.
                         
          A sudden CLUNK in the closet makes her jump. Her head snaps
          around - what was that? She just stares, unable to breathe
          because whatever she just heard is INSIDE HER ROOM!
                         
          White-knuckled grip on that screwdriver, Emily stands up and
          comes slowly over to the CLOSET DOOR.
                         
          Raises the screwdriver. Ready to stab.

          PITCH BLACK inside.
                         
          A tense pause as she stares into that blackness, then reaches
          a hand into the closet, feeling around for the pull-string.
          Finds it. Gives it a tug. And there, right in front of her,
          is a vision of unspeakable horror:

          She comes at Emily arms flailing, clumsy with rage and
          dementia. Emily leaps aside and Margaret goes careening into
          the furniture, howling and spinning like some crazed Whirling
          Dervish.
                         
          Emily scrambles over the bed. Reaches the door. Fumbles at

          gets the door open. Runs out.

          Margaret lunges for her throat.

          It sinks in the second time. Emily scans the sidewalk, the
          darkened streets outside the bus. Margaret is gone. Was
          never there. The driver opens the door, nods to her - out.

          off down the empty street. Emily stands alone. Rain-soaked.
          Shivering. Staring at her house down the block.

          Successive pages show the same two hands, but leaning forward
          into the inky blackness between them is a FACE, its features
          resolving into murky focus as it approaches the glass. The
          last page is a horrific image. A man screaming in such
          terror that his face appears almost deformed.
                         
          It's DOUG. The night of his death. Like a snapshot from his

                          EMILY
           How... how do I...?
                         
                          EDWARD
           Kill her? In her sleep, assuming you
           can...
                          (THEN; THINKING)
           Tell you what I'd do different. Count
           myself dead at the outset. Accept that
           going in and use it to my advantage.
           That's the one thing I don't think she'd
           see coming, someone giving up their own
           life to take hers.
                         
          As Emily registers this...
                         
          INT. EMILY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Middle of the night, the living room is lit by the eerie glow
          of the fish tank. The filter humming. The fish swimming
          languidly. Suddenly they DISPERSE, spooked by something
          outside the tank.
           87.
                         
                         
          INT. EMILY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          The bureau has been pushed in front of the deadbolted door to
          form a barricade. Emily lies in a fetal position on her bed,
          exhausted but unable to sleep.
                         
          She tenses at the sound of a MUFFLED MALE VOICE in the other
          room. Comes over to the door, trying to listen. Thinks she
          recognizes it.
                         
                          EMILY
           (calls through door)
           Mike...?
                         
          No reply.
                         
          A moment of indecision then Emily tightens her grip on the
          screwdriver and quietly slides open the deadbolts.
                         
          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
                         
          She comes slowly down the hall, following the VOICE to its
          source, stops in the living room doorway, haunted...
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
                         THE TELEVISION
                         
          Edward's psych interview playing to the empty room. He's
          straightjacketed, sedated. Talking directly to the camera.
                         
                          EDWARD
           Where is she now? Some family somewhere?
                         
                          INTERVIEWER
           Why does that concern you, Edward?
                         
                          EDWARD
           `Cause you have to warn them.
                         
          Emily turns off the tv. IMMEDIATELY IT SWITCHES ITSELF BACK
          ON. Emily freezes, realizing the room is not empty.
          Turning, she sees Lucy sitting in the shadows holding the
          remote. Lucy mutes the sound and returns Emily's stare,
          thoughtful, almost empathetic.
                         
                          LUCY
           I like it here. I like you. You want me
           to like you, don't you?
                         
          Emily nods. The room bathed in the tv's flickering blue
          light. Lucy is quiet for a moment. Then, in her innocently
          menacing voice, explains the rules:
           88.
                         
                         
                          LUCY
           You have to do what I say. If I say I
           want to go to group, you have to do it.
           If I say I want a new dress, you have to
           do it. If I say I want ice cream every
           day after school, you have to do it.
           Okay?
                         
          Emily gives a haunted nod, remembering:
                         
          A FLASHCUT of Lucy sitting between Edward and Margaret at the
          Child Services meeting, new dress, ribbon in her hair,
          licking her ice cream with a wicked little smile.
                         
          BACK TO SCENE
                         
          Lucy stares coldly at the television: Margaret speaking with
          the sound off.
                         
                          LUCY
           They did what I said for a while and then
           they stopped and started with the
           secrets. But they weren't really secrets
           I guess...
           (looks at Emily)
           ...because I always knew what they were
           thinking.
                         
          She holds Emily's gaze then looks back at the tv. Margaret's
          image reflected in the pupils of her eerie unblinking eyes.
                         
          INT. MARGARET'S PADDED ROOM, PSYCH HOSPITAL - NIGHT
                         
          Margaret, straps unbuckled, sits on the bed beside a YOUNG
          NURSE who checks her temperature. Done, the Nurse heads out.
                         
                          MARGARET
           Don't leave me.
                         
          Terror in Margaret's voice.
                         
                          YOUNG NURSE
           It's okay, Maggie. I'll check on you
           later.
                         
          The Nurse exits. Locks the door.
                         
          CLICK-KA-THUNK. The sound of doom to Margaret.
                         
          She stands up, looking around, trembling at what's to come.
          Her footsteps sound oddly HOLLOW, METALLIC on the floor.
           89.
                         
                         
          MARGARET'S POV - surveying the room, we see what Margaret's
          hell looks like. It's not a room she's living in...
                         
          AN OLD OVEN
                         
          With dark scorched metal walls. A bolted-down bed to one
          side, perfectly white, like a practical joke.
                         
          We can hear the low HISS of it filling with gas. The faint
          POOF as it ignites beneath her. The first SHIMMERING WAVES
          OF HEAT rising up, singeing her hair.
                         
          Margaret runs screaming to the door, claws at the pane of
          glass like a madwoman. But there is no escape from the hell
          of her own mind. The YOUNG NURSE'S FACE APPEARS there in the
          window, shocked by Margaret's insane rantings.
                         
          INT. PSYCH HOSPITAL CAFETERIA - NIGHT
                         
          Edward, dinner tray in hand, going through the cafeteria line
          with other INSTITUTIONAL PATIENTS.
                         
          He sits down at a table and starts eating, quiet, lost in his
          thoughts. Takes another mouthful of food and suddenly stops
          chewing, noticing something very strange:
                         
          A BALD, MORBIDLY OBESE INMATE SITTING DIRECTLY ACROSS THE
          TABLE IS CUTTING PEAS IN HALF ON HIS PLATE, ABSENTLY, BUT
          WITH AN ALMOST SURGICAL PRECISON, EATING THEM ONE BY ONE OFF
          THE TIP OF HIS KNIFE!!
                         
          He lifts his gaze to Edward. Smiles a knowing, taunting
          smile. Then his WIDE WET MOUTH speaks in a little girl's
                         VOICE:
                         
                          LUCY'S VOICE
           I'm happy you're getting the help you
           need, daddy.
                         
          Edward goes berserk. Launches himself across the table at
          the guy, stabbing him in the neck with his fork. Vicious
          attack. Unprovoked as far as anyone else is concerned. A
          guard rushes over. Edward turns on him, maniacal.
                         
          THE GUARD SHOOTS HIM DEAD.
                         
          As blood pools around Edward's body, some LUNATIC who
          witnessed the event starts to applaud. Others join in. It's
          the most excitement they've seen all year. And as the
          applause spreads through the entire cafeteria...
           90.
                         
                         
          EXT. EMILY'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Emily comes down the steps, past the morning paper on the
          walkway. Stops dead in her tracks. Stunned. Comes back and
          picks it up.
                         
          A SMALL PHOTO OF EDWARD ON THE FRONT PAGE WITH A HEADLINE:
          HOSPITAL PROBES DEATH.
                         
          At the bus stop at the end of the street, Lucy mingles
          happily with other CHILDREN. She meets Emily's gaze down the
          length of the sidewalk. Smiles and waves goodbye as she gets
          on the school bus.
                         
          INT. BARRON'S OFFICE, POLICE STATION - DAY
                         
          Emily drops the newspaper on Barron's desk. The headline
          about Edward speaks for itself.
                         
                          BARRON
           I know...
                         
          It's a different Mike Barron than last we saw. Gone is the
          quiet assurance. Whatever happened rocked him to the core.
          He closes the door for privacy.
                         
                          BARRON
           There's something I want you to hear.
           Came in at two o'clock last night. You
           might wanna sit.
                         
          Emily sits. Barron cues a voicemail message on his phone,
          plays it over the speaker. After a BEEP we hear it. A
          SINISTER MALE VOICE, guttural, taunting, the voice of a
                         DEMON:
                         
           SINISTER MALE VOICE

           `Cause you're soft. Soft, soft, soft...
                         
          DELIRIOUS LAUGHTER followed by a CLICK and a DIAL TONE.
          Emily's mouth gapes. After a moment:
           91.

           phone records. That's what she's been
           using.
                         
          Grim pause. Emily digs through her bag. Reaches the bottom.
          No cell phone. Staring into the bag, voice wavering with
                         EMOTION:

           She's taking me apart, Mike.
                         
          She loses it for a second. Barron sits in front of her on
          the edge of the desk.
                         
                          BARRON

           He told me I have to kill her.
                         
          Barron registers that in silence. Stuns her, and himself, by
          what he says next.
                         
                          BARRON

          Emily looks at him. Disbelief.
                         
                          BARRON
           Whatever it takes.

          a row of parked cars.
                         
          A faint JANGLING SOUND stops him dead in his tracks. He
          turns and scans the garage behind him. It's quiet, eerily
          still.
                         
          He continues onward, but hears the faint JANGLING SOUND again
          a moment later. Spins, trying to place it. There it is
          again. Closer this time. Something moving, hiding, behind
          the rows of cars over there.
           93.
                         
                         
          He bends, trying to get a look under the cars. Can't see
          anything. Unnerved, he moves on, clicks the button on his
          keychain remote. The lights flash on his car fifty yards
          away.
                         
          But as he continues toward it they reveal themselves,
          trodding into view from between the cars, CHOKE-CHAIN COLLARS
          JANGLING around their necks...
                         
          THREE PIT BULLS
                         
          Battle-scarred. Vicious. The dogs from Diego's house. They
          sit down right in front of Barron's car. It's a surreal
          moment, a trio of attack dogs sitting at quiet attention,
          square-jawwed, black-eyed, the kinetic calm before a predator
          strikes.
                         
          Barron draws his gun. Fires a warning shot over their heads.
                         
          BANG!
                         
          Deafeningly loud, it echoes through the garage like a
          thunderclap. But the dogs don't move, just sit there
          staring.
                         
          Barron lowers his gun. It's time to get the hell out of
          here. He backpedals, making no sudden movements, gun still
          trained on the dogs.
                         
          They watch him, eyes livening with excitement, one of their
          back legs twitching in anticipation.
                         
          Barron quickens his step and that's their cue.
                         
          ALL AT ONCE, WITH EXPLOSIVE SPEED, THE DOGS SPRING INTO
          MOTION, VICIOUS AND MUSCLED AND SMELLING BLOOD.
                         
          Barron fires an errant shot and takes off running. But he
          can't match their pace, the deadly trio race along the row of
          police cruisers, closing the gap with ease.
                         
          At the last second Barron jumps the partition. The pit bulls
          crash skull-first into the concrete, but continue their
          pursuit unfazed as Barron takes off up the adjoining ramp.
                         
          He jumps up onto the row of cars and runs across the hoods,
          denting the metal. The dogs jump up behind him, relentless
          in their pursuit.
                         
          Jaws snapping at his heels, Barron takes to the car roofs,
          the pitbulls leaping from car to car behind him.
           94.
                         
                         
          He looks back just in time to see the dogs launch themselves.
          They hit him at chest height, sinking teeth in his flesh.
                         
          Stumbling forward, struggling to keep their jaws from his
          throat, Barron doesn't see what's coming. The last car. The
          edge of the parking garage.
                         
          He's over the edge before he even understands, flailing his
          arms for a handhold that doesn't exist. The ground, far
          below, flies up at him in a rush of acceleration.
                         
          We hear a sickening THUD and find Barron lying face down on
          the pavement below, blood pooling around him. Clinging to
          life, he opens his eyes and sees the TRIO OF PIT BULLS
          SITTING OBEDIENTLY BESIDE HIM, unharmed, watching.
                         
          But from a distance we see there is only Barron. Dying alone
          between the parked cars. No dogs anywhere in sight.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Emily opens the front door, peers in, trying not to make a
          sound.
                         
                          EMILY
           Lucy...?
                         
          No reply. She enters. Sees -
                         
          THE CLOSET DOOR IS OPEN.
                         
          She comes closer.
                         
          EMPTY BANKER BOXES strewn in the hall. SCATTERED PAGES.
                         
          At the far end, the light is on in Lucy's bedroom. The door
          open a crack. A shaft of light spilling out into the
          darkened hallway.
                         
          Emily comes down the hallway past SCATTERED FILE PAGES.
          Preliminary reports. Medical records. Personality
          profiles...
                         
          She opens the door to Lucy's room.
                         
          INT. LUCY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Freezes in the doorway, shocked by what lies before her.
                         
                          EMILY
           Oh my God...
           95.
                         
                         
          Black eyes. Bloody noses. Bruises. Cuts. Burns. PHOTOS
          OF ABUSED CHILDREN COVER THE ENTIRE FLOOR. A collage of
          misery.
                         
          Lucy is nowhere to be seen. Emily comes in and starts
          quickly picking them up.
                         
          Tucked between the file cabinet and the wall is a CORKBOARD.
          Emily pulls it out. It's covered with PHOTOS FROM WORK.
          COWORKERS. HER KIDS. Two of the photos are turned around.
          She flips them over in rapid succession. Diego. Doug.
                         
          She rips all the photos from the board.
                         
          Photos bunched in her hands, she heads for the door, but
          hears something that stops her in her tracks -
                         
          A strange INTERMITTENT BUZZING NOISE
                         
          It lasts two seconds and stops. She turns around, scans the
          room. Puts down the stack of photos. There it is again:
                         
          BZZZZZZZZZZZT. BZZZZZZZZZZZZT.
                         
          Sounds like a housefly trapped against a window, but it's
          bigger, angrier, and appears to be coming from the
                         
                         KNOTTED RUG
                         
          at the foot of Lucy's bed. Emily crosses to it. The BUZZING
          STOPS. She bends. Takes hold of a corner. Peels it slowly
          back to reveal
                         
                         BARE FLOOR
                         
          Weird. Nothing there.
                         
          BZZZZZZZZZZZZZT! BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZT!
                         
          Emily straightens, turns. It's coming from the
                         
                         BED
                         
          As she approaches it the BUZZING INTENSIFIES, louder, more
          agitated.
                         
          Pauses as she gets there, terrified of what she might find,
          the bed BUZZING FURIOUSLY FROM WITHIN. Something is trapped
          under those blankets, waiting for release.
                         
          Emily extends a trembling hand, takes hold of the blankets
          and, slowly, rigid with fear, peels them back to reveal
           96.
                         
                         
                         BARE MATTRESS
                         
          Impossible, because the BUZZING IS LOUDER THAN EVER.
                         
          With a tense swallow Emily realizes it's coming from lower,
          deeper within the bed, between the mattress and the box
          spring.
                         
          She slips her fingers into the crack.
                         
          And slowly lifts the mattress, the BUZZING GROWING
          FRIGHTENINGLY LOUD as its source is exposed, something
          hellish waiting for her as she cranes her neck and look to
          see what lies below -
                         
          HER CELL PHONE
                         
          Vibrating. BZZZZZZZZZT. BZZZZZZZZZZT. On the viewscreen:
          "INCOMING CALL..."
                         
          She picks it up. Stares at it vibrating in her hand.
          Presses the TALK button. Brings it to her ear.
                         
          The LOW STATIC of an open line. Then, a RASPY MALE VOICE:
                         
           MALE VOICE ON PHONE
           Emily...
                         
          Emily flinches.
                         
                          EMILY
           Who is this...?
                         
           MALE VOICE ON PHONE
           It's Wayne, Emily, I just got a call,
           Mike's dead...
                         
          Emily, stunned, barely able to speak.
                         
                          EMILY
           No... he's...
                         
           WAYNE (V.O.)
           They don't know if he fell or what
           happened...
                         
          Emily's phone hand drops to her side in shock. From down
          there, we hear Wayne's voice:
                         
           WAYNE (V.O.)
           Emily? Emily, are you okay...?
                         
          After a moment, she lifts it.
           97.
                         
                         
                          EMILY
           I have to go.
                         
          Hangs up. On the brink of emotional collapse. Her only
          confidante dead.
                         
          Just then she hears BREATHING from behind the open door.
          Someone or something hiding in that dark corner over there.
          She crosses to it. Pulls back the door and there sits
                         
                         LUCY
                         
          quiet, innocent, chin on her knees.
                         
                          EMILY
           What did you do to him?
                         
          Lucy says nothing. Emily grabs her by the arm. Yanks her to
          her feet.
                         
                          EMILY
           WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM?!
                         
          After a moment:
                         
                          LUCY
           He did it to himself.
                         
          WHACK! Emily slaps her. Hard across the face. Knocks her
          to the floor. Lucy sits up, lip split. Tastes the blood
          with her tongue. Hint of a smile. The taste of victory.
                         
                          LUCY
           Europa. Ganymede. Io. Callisto. The
           moons of Jupiter. We got back our
           astronomy tests today.
                         
          It's there on the floor. A++ Well done, Lucy!
                         
          There's a LOUD BEEP in the other room. Lucy gets up and
          walks out. Emily watches as Lucy goes into the kitchen.
          Takes a bag of popcorn from the microwave. Empties it into a
          bowl. Sits down on the living room sofa and clicks on the tv
          remote, watching it like nothing ever happened. Emily walks
          over and pitches the tv onto the floor. The SCREEN SHATTERS.
                         
                          EMILY
           Get out of my house.
                         
          Lucy, unimpressed, expressionless, takes another handful of
          popcorn. Chews it. CRUNCH. CRUNCH. CRUNCH. Emily swats
          the bowl from her hands.
           98.
                         
                         
                          EMILY
           GET OUT!
                         
          Flicking bits of popcorn off herself, Lucy stands up from the
          sofa. Her face catches the light from the hallway. Emily
          shudders at the sight.
                         
          Lucy's features look altered somehow, sharpened. It's
          subtle, but the overall effect is chilling. THE FACE OF A
          LITTLE GIRL LAID OVER THE MUSCULATURE OF SOMETHING MORE
          DEVIOUS AND WICKED.
                         
                          LUCY
           Don't yell at me. My mom and dad used to
           yell at me.
                         
          Emily backs away, mortified, takes off down the hall.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Rushes in. Slams the door. Bolts the deadbolts. CLUNK.
          CLUNK. CLUNK. Moment of panic. Will they hold?
                         
          Slides her bureau in front of the door. Shoves her bed in
          front of the bureau just to be sure.
                         
          In the silence we hear LUCY'S FOOTSTEPS coming down the hall
          toward the door.
                         
          Closer, closer...
                         
          There's nothing else to block the door with. Emily backs
          away, trembling as
                         
          LUCY'S FOOTSTEPS arrive at the door. A tense silence. Then:
                         
           LUCY (O.S.)
           Emily... I'm sorry... I didn't mean to...
                         
          Emily grabs the screwdriver, clutches it in both hands.
                         
           LUCY (O.S.)
           Can I come in so we can talk and work it
           out?
                         
          There's a GENTLE KNOCK on the door. Emily flinches,
          remembering last time.
                         
           LUCY (O.S.)
           Emily...?
                         
                          EMILY
           Stay away from me!
           99.
                         
                         
           LUCY (O.S.)
           Don't be mad. I said I was sorry. I'll
           brush your hair for you.
                         
                          EMILY
           STAY AWAY FROM ME!!
                         
          Silence.
                         
                         THEN:
                         
          WHAM! The door shudders from a MAMMOTH IMPACT. Last time,
          it shook the door, this time it shakes the entire wall.
          Emily recoils, dropping the screwdriver.
                         
          WHAM! CRACKS APPEAR in the door as it bows from the
          tremendous force.
                         
          WHAM!! CRACKS FAN OUT into the plaster around the doorframe.
                         
          WHAM!! Half the SCREWS HOLDING THE HINGES fly from the wall.
                         
          WHAM!! The DEADBOLTS BENDING from the ungodly pummeling.
                         
          WHAM!! The DEADBOLT SCREWS getting yanked from the wood.
                         
          Emily frozen in terror, watching. Whatever's out there is
          coming in.
                         
          WHAM!! One of the DOOR HINGES rips clean from the wall.
                         
          WHAM!! The FIRST DEADBOLT comes flying off.
                         
          WHAM!! The SECOND DOOR HINGE gone.
                         
          WHAM!! ANOTHER DEADBOLT flies off.
                         
          WHAM!! The DOOR SPLITS down the center.
                         
          WHAM!! The THIRD DEADBOLT lands on the floor at Emily's feet
          with a METAL THUD.
                         
          A breathless silence.
                         
          Then the DOOR RATTLES and drops loose from the frame with a
          DEAD WOODEN CLUNK.
                         
          Nothing holding it in place now except the bureau and the
          bed. And now they both start to SLIDE BACKWARDS as whatever
          is on the other side starts pushing its way in.
           100.
                         
                         
          Emily topples a high bookcase against the door and pushes
          back with every ounce of strength she can muster, but it's no
          use. The bureau overturns, CRASHES to the floor. Emily's
          bare feet slide backwards along with the bed.
                         
          And then they stop. The barricade sufficiently breached.
                         
          Emily, in her panic, makes a hasty decision. She hides under
          the bed.
                         
          We HOLD LOW on the open door as LUCY'S FEET step into the
          room, the feet of a child, but the BREATHING we hear sounds
          emphysemic and the VOICE is unquestionably male - harsh,
          guttural, taunting Emily as it comes for her:
                         
           SINISTER MALE VOICE
           Emily...
                         
          Wide-eyed with terror under the bed, she watches those feet
          pick their way over the shattered remnants of the barricade.
                         
           SINISTER MALE VOICE
           Emily... We need to learn healthier ways
           of resolving conflict, Emily.
                         
          The feet step gingerly past the overturned bureau.
                         
           SINISTER MALE VOICE
           ...Most families don't even know they
           have a problem...
                         
          The feet stop at the SCREWDRIVER.
                         
           SINISTER MALE VOICE
           ...until it's too late.
                         
          A HAND reaches down and picks it up, a girl's hand, but the
          fingers as they wrap tightly around the handle look strong
          and sinewy.
                         
          The feet stand motionless for a moment then turn and come
          toward the bed, stopping right in front of EMILY'S HORRIFIED
          FACE.
                         
          A pause and then, still from Emily's POV, we see Lucy lower
          herself onto her knees.
                         
          WHAM!! - with shocking force that hand IMPALES THE
          SCREWDRIVER IN THE WOODEN FLOOR!
                         
          Another pause then both hands come into view, palms flat on
          the hardwood, as she leans her head down.
           101.
                         
                         
          Emily recoiling in anticipation as the face comes into view -
                         
          LUCY'S INNOCENT FACE
                         
          A little girl. With a little girl voice to match.
                         
                          LUCY
                          (PLAYING MOMMY)
           What are you doing, you silly
           pumpkinhead?
                         
          Emily, hyperventilating, stares in shock. Lucy reaches her
          hand in. Emily backs away, wedges herself in the corner.
                         
                          LUCY
                          (PLAYING MOMMY)
           You don't want me to come under there and
           get you, do you?
                         
          Emily, crying now, shakes her head. Lucy, almost
          sympathetic, frowns.
                         
                          LUCY
                          (PLAYING MOMMY)
           I'm going to count to three. One...
                         
                          EMILY
           No...

                          (PLAYING MOMMY)
           Two and three quarters... Three...
                         
          Lucy starts crawling under the bed.
                         
                          LUCY
           Here I come.
                         
          Emily tries to go backwards, but there's nowhere for her to
          go.
                         
          LUCY'S FACE SLIDING CLOSER LIKE THE HEAD OF A SNAKE.
                         
          Trapped, Emily screams.
           102.
                         
                         
                          EMILY
           WHAT DO YOU WANT?!!
                         
          Lucy stops crawling. Folds her arms, sets her chin on them.
          Comfortable here under the bed. Delighting in the question.
                         
                          LUCY
           What you wanted from your mother. I want
           you to love me.
                         
                          EMILY
           Okay... okay, I will, I will, I promise.
                         
          Lucy weighs Emily's surrender for a moment. Then, oddly
                         BRIGHT:
                         
                          LUCY
           Come tuck me in.
                         
                          EMILY
           Okay... I'll be right there.
                         
                          LUCY
           You better come.
                         
          Lucy slithers out and we see her feet scamper from the room.
          Emily puts her head down on the floor and cries, covering her
          mouth with her hands so she won't make a sound.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
                         
          A WHISTLING KETTLE on the stove.
                         
          Emily, still in tears, takes it from the burner. Dumps SIX
          SLEEPING PILLS from the prescription bottle. Crushes them
          with the blunt edge of a knife. Stirs them into a cup of
          Chamomile tea.
                         
          She freezes at a NOISE behind her. Looks tensely over her
          shoulder.
                         
          The fridge.
                         
          She adds sugar, continues stirring.
                         
          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
                         
          We follow the TEA CUP, in Emily's hand, as she comes
          nervously down the hall to Lucy's room. We can see Lucy in
          there, waiting for her in bed. Emily, playing the part,
          dries her eyes and enters.
           103.
                         
                         
          INT. LUCY'S ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Sits down on the bed, hands Lucy the tea.
                         
                          LUCY
           Chamomile.
                         
          Emily nods. The face of a loving mother. Lucy brings the
          cup to her lips, pauses.
                         
                          LUCY
           Maybe you should have it, you look
           stressed.
                         
                          EMILY
           I'll have one later.
                         
          Lucy considers this, nods okay, takes a sip of tea. Emily
          picks up a brush and brushes Lucy's hair.
                         
                          EMILY
           Tomorrow's our new beginning.
                         
                          LUCY
           I'll be good.
                         
                          EMILY
           I know.
                         
          Lucy takes a few more sips and sets the tea cup on the
          bedside table. Emily, tucking her in, gives the cup a
          nervous glance. Did she drink enough?
                         
                          EMILY
           Get some rest.
                         
                          LUCY
           Say it.
                         
                          EMILY
           I love you.
                         
                          LUCY
           Forever and ever?
                         
                          EMILY
           Forever and ever.
                         
          Emily kisses her on the forehead. Lucy looks up at her and
          for a moment she's the little girl Emily met. Innocent,
          angelic, closing her eyes for sleep. They flutter open one
          last time.
           104.
                         
                         
                          LUCY
           Where are you if I need you?
                         
                          EMILY
           Right down the hall.
                         
          Lucy's eyes shut. Emily, brushing her hair, staring at the
          HALF-FULL TEA CUP.
                         
          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
                         
          Lucy asleep in bed. Emily watches from the door, wary,
          expecting Lucy's eyes to snap open any second.
                         
                          EMILY
           Sweetheart...?
                         
          She doesn't move, dead to the world. Or is it a game? Emily
          closes the door. Leans against the wall, shaking,
          contemplating her next move.
                         
          Wedges a chair under the door handle. Time of the essence.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S GARAGE - NIGHT
                         
          Junk-filled. The door lifts to reveal Emily, silhouetted,
          looking in. Amid the clutter is a lawnmower. Beside it, a
          big can of GASOLINE.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Emily stifling sobs as she douses the walls of the house.
          The hallway, the bathroom, the kitchen, all of it.
                         
          TIP OF A MATCH strikes flint, ignites.
                         
          Emily stares at it for a long moment.
                         
          Lets it fall.
                         
          FLAMES SCURRY in a shimmering blue-gold sheet across the
          floor. Climb the walls, the entire house ablaze in a matter
          of seconds.
                         
          Emily sits and watches as the door to Lucy's bedroom is
          engulfed. It's an image straight from hell: A YOUNG WOMAN
          SITTING ON A SOFA IN A HOUSE OF FIRE.
                         
          The fish, frantic in their tank, catch Emily's eye. She goes
          over and grabs the tank.
           105.
                         
                         
          EXT. EMILY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Smoke swirling past her, she exits the house, locking the
          front door behind her. She backs away and watches it burn,
          holding her fish tank, the only thing she saved.
                         
           TIME CUT TO:
                         
          Billowing black smoke. The house fully engulfed as fire
          engines arriving on the scene, sirens wailing. Emily
          watching with neighbors on the sidewalk as the FIREFIGHTERS
          uncoil their hoses.
                         
          The window to Lucy's bedroom is a bright red square, an
          inferno. And as Emily stares at it, disbelieving what she's
          done, the figure of a CHILD appears.
                         
                         LUCY
                         
          Her whole body ablaze. Horrific. She just stands there,
          arms at her sides, burning.
                         
          Just now the FIRE MARSHALL crosses to the onlookers. Hollers
          over the noise and commotion:
                         
                          FIRE MARSHALL
           Everybody get out okay?!
                         
          Emily wavers, not sure what to say. The Fire Marshall sees
          her indecision.
                         
                          FIRE MARSHALL
           This your house?!
           (she nods yes)
           Anybody else inside?!
           (off her hesitation)
           Ma'am...?!
                         
          Emily opens her mouth to reply, but sees something behind her
          that closes her throat.
                         
                         LUCY
                         
          standing on the sidewalk in her pajamas. Unscathed.
                         
                          FIRE MARSHALL
           Anyone else inside?! Yes or no?!
                         
          Emily, in shock, shakes her head no. The Fire Marshall
          rushes off, walkie-talkie squawking. Emily stands frozen as
          Lucy comes through the crowd to her. More dismayed than
          angry.
           106.
                         
                         
                          LUCY
           That was mean.
                         
          She takes Emily's hand. Together they watch the house burn.
          Firelight playing on their faces. The fish bouncing off the
          glass in the tank at Emily's feet.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S CAR - NIGHT
                         
          The blue halflight before dawn. Emily and Lucy sit in the
          Volvo, eyeing the scorched remains of the house. The
          firecrew stowing equipment. Emily puts the car in drive.
                         
          INT. EMILY'S CAR - DAWN
                         
          The FISH FLOATING DEAD at the top of the tank in the back
          seat as Emily drives down the freeway at daybreak. Lucy
          gazing out dreamily at the sunrise.
                         
                          LUCY
           Maybe we can find a hotel with a swimming
           pool.
                         
          Emily says nothing. Lucy turns and looks at her, thoughtful,
          almost empathetic. She draws up her knees and rests her chin
          on top, levels an appraising stare at Emily like the one she
          leveled at Doug.
                         
                          LUCY
           It's sad, isn't it? How it gets passed
           on. How people do to their own kids what
           their parents did to them. That's why
           you got the job...
                         
          Emily turns on the radio, full volume, trying to drown out
          Lucy's voice. Lucy reaches over and turns it off. CLICK.
                         
                          LUCY
           ...To prove to yourself you're not like
           her, that you're not like your mother.
           Because that scares you. Scares you more
           than anything.
                         
          Lucy, in mock sentiment, puts her hand on Emily's.
                         
                          LUCY
           I love you... even if you don't love me.
                         
          Emily looks at her, gutted. But defiant. Turning her gaze
          forward, she tightens her grip on the wheel and calmly,
          resolutely, JAMS THE GAS PEDAL TO THE FLOOR. The
          acceleration pitches Lucy backwards into her seat. She sits
          up, eyes wide, didn't see this coming. A suicide run.
           107.
                         
                         
                          LUCY
           What are you doing? Slow down.
                         
          A tense smile from Lucy. The tables have turned.
                         
                          LUCY
           Did you hear me?
                         
          Emily stares dead ahead, red-lining the tachometer. Lucy
          flits her eyes skyward. IMMEDIATELY IT DARKENS AND STARTS TO
          RAIN. Emily turns on the wipers, speeds on, unfazed.
                         
                          LUCY
           I said slow down!
                         
          Emily ignores her, going eighty now, weaving through SLOWER
          TRAFFIC THAT FLIES TOWARD THEM OUT OF THE GRAY HAZE. Lucy,
          panicking, changes channels like a tv. Innocent child all of
          a sudden.
                         
                          LUCY
           Please, stop, Emily, I'll be good.
                         
          Emily ignores her, beyond apology. And Lucy's face sharpens.
          She points down the road.
                         
                          LUCY
           Look out!
                         
          Through the heavy rain we see -
                         
          A TRACTOR-TRAILER RIG CRASH THROUGH THE DIVIDING MEDIAN AND
          JACKKNIFE, BARRELING AT THEM HEAD-ON!
                         
          Emily goes for the brake, but reconsiders, seeing the truck
          for what it is: a test of faith. She welcomes it. Tightens
          her grip on the wheel and goes full throttle again, right at
          the truck. Lucy shrieks in terror.
                         
                          LUCY

           Yes, it is!
                         
                          EMILY
           Are you scared?!
           108.
                         
                         
          Pedal to the floor. Inviting the head-on collision. You can
          see the BIG RIG DRIVER in the cab, wrestling frantically with
          the steering wheel. Lucy bracing herself, screams -
                         
                          LUCY
           STOP!
                         
          Emily clenches her teeth in anticipation of impact, of death.
                         
          THE CHROME GRILLWORK OF THE TRUCK RUSHES TOWARD THEM IN THAT
          FINAL MOMENT, THE AIR HORN DEAFENINGLY LOUD!
                         
          But the impact never comes. In the blink of an eye the truck
          is gone. Open road in front of them. It's not raining.
          Never was. The wipers SQUEAKING on a dry windshield.
                         
          Lucy sits in silence, her bag of tricks empty. Emily,
          triumphant, turns to her with a vindictive smile, the
          speedometer hitting a hundred.
                         
                          EMILY
           ARE YOU SCARED?!
                         
          She clutches Lucy's wrist.
                         
                          EMILY
           I'M NOT!!
                         
          Emily jerks the car off the road, crashing through the
          guardrail. Trees snapping in half across the hood as they go
          careening through roadside woods and down a steep embankment
                         TOWARD -

          INT. EMILY'S VOLVO - DAY
                         
          Impacts and sinks with frightening speed. Water rushing in
          from all sides. Emily shackles Lucy with her arms as the
          water rises to cover their mouths.
                         
                         UNDERWATER

          LUCY'S LIPS CURL INTO THAT CREEPY MANNISH SMILE.
                         
          As though she anticipated this. Or welcomes it. Or knows
          something Emily does not. And now Emily sees what Lucy sees -
           109.

          A HAND pries open the door and wrestles Lucy from Emily's
          grasp. Pulls her from the car, swimming to the surface with
          her. Emily is left empty-handed, stunned, alone in her
          watery grave.
                         
          SHE DROWNS IN STAGES, EACH ONE DIFFICULT TO WATCH, THE
          INITIAL FRANTIC FLAILINGS, THE HOPELESS PANIC, THE SLOW
          DAWNING OF ACCEPTANCE, THE MUSCLES LOOSENING, ARMS FLOATING
          LIMP, EYES FIXED IN A BLANK STARE.
                         
          And just when her death seems certain, a HAND grabs her by

          her face. Paramedics checking her vitals.
                         
          Loaded into the ambulance, she meets the gaze of Lucy who is
          being attended to by a female PARAMEDIC, who puts her arm
          around Lucy in a maternal gesture, shielding her from the
          sight of Emily as Emily did of the Sheridans.

          Services, another tier of the child welfare system.
                         
                          CASEWORKER
           Going to the thing Saturday?
                         
                          SUPERVISOR
           I don't know.
                         
                          CASEWORKER
           Oh, you should. It'll be fun.
                         
                          SUPERVISOR
           Maybe I will, I don't know. We'll see.

           Bye, Janey.
                         
                          SUPERVISOR
           See you tomorrow.
                         
          The Caseworker exits. The Supervisor comes down the row of
          cubicles dropping files on desks. Alone. After hours. A
          thankless profession.
                         
          It lands on some random desk, amid the usual backlog of mail
          and paperwork. A case file like all the others. The name
          typed on the label:
                         
          SHERIDAN, LUCY.
                         
           FADE OUT.
