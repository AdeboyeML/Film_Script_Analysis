           I think there will be a groundswell

           their most rudimentary needs-- they

           So I was in school but then I
           dropped out because I really wanted
           to work in fashion but it's really
           hard to find a paid internship? So
           I went back to school and now I
           work at Yoga Yurt part time but I'm
           really looking to make money doing
           something I love? But I'm sure the
           universe is looking out for me and
           when the time is right, the right
           thing will come along, you know?

          17 INT. CELESTE'S BEDROOM- NIGHT 17
                         
           Celeste is in bed on the computer. She hears noise from the
           outside. She listens more intently and hears Jesse... and a
           woman, giggling and talking loudly. Then, the studio door
           shuts. Is Yogurt Girl sleeping over? He wouldn't do that.
           Would he?

           Again, with the morning symphony. Celeste drinks coffee, eats
           breakfast, surfs the internet and flips through magazines.
           This time, she's also listening to a song from Riley Banks'
           new album. It's exactly what she thought it would be.
           Overproduced, auto-tuned and meaningless. She nods her head,
           "yeah, I get it." She turns it off.
                         
           Celeste can't stop herself from constantly looking over at
           the studio to see if Yogurt Girl is still in there. Finally,
           a sleeping Jesse stirs for a minute and changes position. He
           is alone. Phew.

          corner at a very obscured aisle with a sign reading "More New
          Releases." Three copies of her book, "Shitegeist" appear in
          the very bottom row, barely visible. She is disappointed.

           you seem more "business-oriented,"
           unlike the iPhone which is for
           teenage girls. You go to yoga

           relationship." She's drunk and this makes her sad. Oh,
           there's a video. It's of Jesse and Veronica. Jesse presents
           Veronica with a cake, she laughs and blows out the candles.
           They kiss. Crushing. Confusing. Her doorbell rings.

           I don't know what I'm doing. Dating

           Senior year of college, we had a

           the champagne of beers, and we

           important in the world, you know,
           Heidegger's influence on hip-hop.
           Or the feminist duality on "Melrose

           Huh?
                         
          Celeste makes the "C and J" hand gesture from the high school
          photo in the opening montage. Jesse makes it back. They
          smile.
                         
           JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           I love you.
                         
          He kisses her on the lips. For the last time. And then, he's
          gone.

           Celeste drives and dials a number on her bluetooth.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Hey. So, you're probably giving
           your card to some girl in yoga
           right now. But if that doesn't work
           out for you...I think I may be
           ready. To beat you in Scrabble.

           Celeste runs in to pay for gas. She is on her Blackberry.
                         
                         
          106 INT. GAS STATION MART 106
                         
           Celeste stands in line with some gum and water. A young man
           blatantly cuts in front of her with a gallon of water. Old
           Celeste returns for a moment.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Excuse me, sir?
                         
           The young man turns around. Celeste realizes she's no longer
           this person. She restrains herself.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Nothing.
                         
           Celeste takes in how she has changed. She smiles a little.
           The young man turns back to her.
                         
                          YOUNG MAN
           Hey, I'm sorry for cutting. My
           dog's in the car and he's really
           thirsty. So, thanks.
                         
                          CELESTE
           No problem.
                         
           She smiles again. The world feels bigger now.
