          EXT. STREET - DAY
                         
          A small kid, TJ FORNEY (13), with a grubby worn cast on his arm,
          rides his BMX really fast down a street. He chases a tow truck
          towing a badly wrecked red Volvo.
                         
          He struggles to keep up. The truck makes a turn. TJ follows,
          turning dangerously in front of oncoming traffic.
                         
          The truck makes another turn. TJ turns with it, running straight
          into the side of a car pulling out of a driveway. He comes off
          his bike and is thrown across the hood. He picks himself up,
          stunned. The driver of the car gets out to see if he's hurt.
                         
          TJ looks down the street to see the tow truck disappearing in
          the distance. He hurries back to his bike. He jumps on and
          continues after the truck.
                         
          TJ gives chase. He gains on the truck. He can see it pull into a
          used car lot ahead - FAIR OAKS CAR CITY.
                         
          EXT. FAIR OAKS CAR CITY - DAY
                         
          TJ arrives at the car lot as the TOW TRUCK DRIVER is lowering
          the car onto the drive. TJ dumps his bike, out of breath.
                         
                          TJ
           This car has to go back.

                          TJ
           This car has to go back to where it
           came from. Put it back on the truck.
                         
           TOW TRUCK DRIVER
           What are you talking about, kid?
                         
          The driver continues working, unhooking the car from the truck.
                         
                          TJ
           Stop unhooking it. There's been a
           mistake.
                         
           TOW TRUCK DRIVER
           I was told to bring it here. That's
           what it says on my work order. Talk to
           that guy if you've got a problem.
                         
          The driver nods in the direction of LARRY TOWERS, who is
          approaching with 17 year-old DUSTIN HOWARD and another man,
          TONY, in dirty overalls.

           It wasn't supposed to go anywhere. It
           needs to go back where it came from.
           The guy who sold it to you made a
           mistake.

           Well, it's his name on the pink slip,

          Tony looks through his papers for the work order. TJ doesn't
          like being ignored. He moves around to the driver's side of the
          wrecked car and wrenches open the bashed-in door. He climbs
          behind the wheel, slams the door shut and locks the door.

          The window is rising. Dustin grabs at TJ. TJ keeps winding the
          window. It gets to the top, trapping Dustin's arm.

          Dustin is stuck. Larry, Bill and Tony laugh. Dustin yells at TJ.
          TJ ignores him, staring straight ahead.
                         
          The men laugh some more. Dustin's humiliation sets in.

          Larry goes around to the passenger's side broken window and
          opens the door. He leans in and easily drags TJ out of the car.

          Up ahead, he can see a small section of unfinished road - a big
          patch of dirt and rocks. He veers up a driveway to avoid it. He
          passes the dirt patch and then comes down off the curb back onto
          the road, trying to keep control of his bike. He hits the road
          and loses his balance. The handlebars twist and he crashes onto
          the road.
                         
          He jumps up and yelps in pain, clutching his elbow. He looks at
          it. It's badly grazed. He yelps again, angry. He picks up a rock
          lying in the street and charges towards an unfinished house. He
          hurls the rock through its front window. Glass crashes down.
                         
          A silent beat passes, and then the front door of the house opens
          and a late-20s, long-greasy-haired, wiry shirtless guy in filthy
          black jeans emerges. He has a baby moustache and a cracked front
          tooth. This is HESHER. He makes a determined line toward TJ.

          hits the deck dragging TJ down with him. Their faces are close
          together. Hesher makes a very serious finger-to-mouth gesture to
          'shhhh'.

          bass guitar and a sleeping bag.
                         
          A car door closes loudly. Hesher peers through the window and
          sees a SECURITY GUARD inspecting TJ's bike in the front yard and
          then making his way toward the house.

           metaphoric function in narrative
           fiction, as they do in life, what

          A little pebble hits TJ's desk. It bounces onto the floor. TJ
          looks around to find where it came from - and then another one
          hits him in the head.
                         
          He looks out the window. Hesher is right outside the window. He
          takes the cap off of a large BLACK MAGIC MARKER. He holds it up
          to his nose and takes a long slow inhale. He exhales slow and
          long, staring hard at TJ.
                         
          TJ looks around confused. Hesher recaps the marker, throws it
          hard at TJ and wanders off. The marker hits TJ, then falls to
          floor near his feet. He reaches for it. Mrs. Elsberry sees this.

          We see that someone has drawn - in BIG BLACK MARKER - a crude
          picture of a body, sitting on a toilet with a big erect penis.
          The picture is drawn on the side of Dustin's Mustang door, so
          his real head lines up with the drawing. It's drawn in
          perspective so it looks like Dustin's head is attached to the
          naked defecating body to outsiders. The words 'SUCK MY COCK'
          have been scrawled beside the picture. Dustin swerves the car
          toward TJ, narrowly missing him. TJ cuts into a large super
          market parking lot, attempting to get away.
                         
          Dustin accelerates ahead of TJ and screeches to a halt in front

          falls off his bike. His bike lands on top of him.
                         
          Dustin jumps out of his car and starts beating TJ in the middle
          of parking lot traffic. TJ struggles just to protect himself,
          cowering on the ground and covering his head. Dustin tries to
          wrestle TJ free of the bike so as to get a clearer shot at him.
          He drags TJ by his T-shirt, ripping it off in the process.

          Hesher shuts the drawer. He's holding a fork.
                         
                          HESHER
           Nope, I'm good.

          Hesher strides across the back lawn in his underwear.
                         
          TJ and Dad step out the door and watch him.
                         
          Hesher reaches a telephone pole and climbs it nimbly like a
          monkey. At the top, he fiddles around with the fork, banging and
          wrenching at the cable box.
                         
          He drops the fork to the ground and begins his descent. Only a
          couple of feet from the ground, he loses his grip and falls,
          crashing down into a thick bush at the base of the pole.

          TJ and Dad stand staring frozen.
                         
          Hesher lifts himself up out of the bushes, brushes himself off
          and heads back to the house.

          the newly acquired channels. He finds porn and drops the remote
          down beside him. He sits back and watches girl-on-girl action.
                         
          TJ and Dad stand just inside the TV room, stunned, watching the
          newly acquired porn.
                         
          Then a LOUD BUZZ marking the end of the wash's cycle sounds from
          the laundry room.
                         
          Hesher gets up off the couch and heads for it.

           eighteen hundred dollars, not
           including taxes, registration, ADM, or
           dealer's fees. On top of that, you'd

           you don't have one of those. You'd
           need valid car insurance. I'm guessing
           you don't have that either. But even
           if you did have these things, I still
           couldn't sell it to you because the

          TJ and Dad sit on beanbags set out in a circle of about 12.
          Eight of these beanbags have people sitting on them - adults and
          a few kids. Some drink tea and coffee from little styrofoam
          cups. The tone is sombre. Dad and TJ look unsure of themselves.

           curled up crying in the corner and the
           mouse ruled that fuckin' cage. And

           used to sit in a little miniature lawn

           had to feed him other mice, but every
           time I dropped another mouse in the

          Dustin moves to stand. Hesher pounces on him, dragging him along
          the ground. He grabs the shears and brings them straight up to
          Dustin's nose. In the same movement, he snaps the shears shut
          and takes the end of Dustin's nose off.
                         
          Dustin squeals in pain and scurries backwards, clutching his
          face, blood leaking between his fingers. TJ stands, stunned.

          TJ rides his bike over a rickety red bridge. He pulls his bike
          up outside the tall wire fence of a big dirty wrecking yard -
          D&S Auto-Wreckers. It's still raining very hard. TJ is soaking
          wet. He sits on his bike, looking at mountains of wrecked cars
          inside.

          TJ stops. He sees his mom's car atop a tall stack of wrecks. He

          base of the stack and begins to climb.
                         
          He clambers slowly up the pile in the rain. It's awkward and
          difficult and more than a little dangerous.

          Grandma.
                         
          In slow motion the three walk. Dad puts his arm around TJ's
          shoulders, TJ puts his arm around Dad's.
                         
          And then a cop car cruises beside them slow. The cops inside
          watch them. Dad looks over. One of the cops smiles.

          The cop car pulls up outside the house. The back door opens and
          Hesher falls out onto the sidewalk, still very drunk. Dad climbs
          out and steps over Hesher helping him to his feet. A cop speaks
          to them from the open window.

          TJ and Dad walks across the garage to the open door. At the
