          BEGIN TITLES - OPENING SEQUENCE MONTAGE
          
            Over black we HEAR the rhythmic sound of machinery. This
          sound will continue throughout the title sequence as other
          sounds fade in and out. We move forward and back in time.
          
          EXT. APARTMENT - DAY
          
          A sparrow flutters in birdseed on a window sill. More birds
          crowd a bird feeder that hangs above.
          
          EXT. SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - DAY
          
          A lone child swings lazily on a swing. Other children tear
          about in a wild game of chase.
          
          INT. LUMBERYARD WAREHOUSE - DAY
          
          CLOSE on a piece of wood as it is fed through a wood chipper.
          
          A man finishes feeding the log into the chipper. He pauses to
          wipe the sweat and grime from his face. He is WALTER, early
          forties, features handsome but hardened by time.
          
          INT. BUS - EARLY MORNING
          
          Walter is silhouetted by the early morning light. He holds a
          duffel bag in his lap and watches out the bus window.
          
          The sun is just rising over the horizon, streaks of pink and
          purple graze the frosted ground. Wilderness gives way to
          frozen farmland.
          
          INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY
          
          Walter stands at a counter, a female officer fingerprints
          each finger.
          
          EXT. LUMBERYARD - DAY
          
          Walter and some other men drop the side of the flatbed truck
          and trees crash to the ground.
          
          
          
          
                                                                    2.
          
          
          
          EXT. BUS STOP - DAY
          
          The bus pulls away, revealing Walter standing alone on the
          sidewalk of a dilapidated neighborhood. He holds his duffle
          bag.
          
          INT. WAREHOUSE - DUSK
          
          The 5 o'clock whistle BLOWS. Workers hustle to get their
          coats and punch out. Walter stands in line, keeping to
          himself. As his turn arrives to punch out he receives a rough
          knock by two guys play-fighting behind him. Walter doesn't
          react, punches out, and exits the door.
          
          Vicki, a tough-looking but striking woman, stands in line a
          little further back watching.
          
          
          EXT./INT. APARTMENT - DAY
          
          A superintendent opens the door to an apartment, then hands
          Walter the keys. Her gaze is cold.
          
          Walter closes the door and turns around. He stands in the
          middle of a prefab/pre-furnished kitchen, living room area.
          Light works its way through the dilapidated blinds.
          
          INT. LUMBERYARD OFFICE - DAY
          
          Walter shakes the boss's hand -- BOB, early thirties,
          strapping and trim, is the manager of the business.
          
          MARY-KAY, the secretary, looks up from her typing and takes
          Walter in. Bob introduces them. She is in her early forties.
          Walter follows Bob from the office, Mary-Kay watches as they
          leave.
          
          INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT
          
          There is a flash as a camera snaps a photo.
          
          Walter is captured in a photograph, standing against a baby-
          blue background.
          
          
                                                                    3.
          
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - DAY
          
          Walter lifts the blinds. The birds flutter away.
          
                                                               CUT TO:
          
          Walter stands under the shower.
          
                                                               CUT TO:
          
          Walter, hair wet and clean shaven, tosses back some pills.
          
          EXT. WAREHOUSE - DUSK
          
          Tires SCREECH as cars tear out of the driveway. Walter stands
          at a bus stop across the street.
          
          As Vicki walks across the lot, a car pulls up next to her and
          men catcall and whistle out the window.
          
          Vicki flicks them off. The men burst into hysterics and peal
          out of the lot. She gets in her Jeep and leaves, tearing by
          the bus stop.
          
           Walter looks after her then turns his collar up against the
          chill. It is late winter. The trees are bare -- black
          silhouettes against the darkening sky.
          
          Walter turns towards the shelter for protection from the
          wind. Filling the kiosk, a clothing advertisement displays a
          young girl striking a seductive pose.
          
          INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY
          
          CLOSE on a police file. A mug shot reveals Walter, many years
          younger. Pages are flipped through giving glimpses of newspaper
          clippings as well as typed documents. Words stand out --
          "Convicted, 1st degree --," "3 counts --," "served --."
          
          A plain clothes officer closes the folder and looks out his
          office window where Walter stands being fingerprinted. This
          is Sergeant LUCAS, mid-fifties, face creased and greying
          hair.
          
          
                                                                    4.
          
          
          
          INT. BUS - DAY
          
          Walter watches out the window as farmland gives way to city.
          Traffic builds, billboards line the highway.
          
          INT. LUMBERYARD WAREHOUSE - DAY
          
          Details of machines cutting the wood.
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - DAY
          
          Walter fills the bird feeder with birdseed.
          
          There is the SOUND of children playing, and Walter looks up.
          
          Walter's POV: Across the way, children play outside of the
          school.
          
          Walter watches then closes his window.
          
          EXT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY
          
          Walter exits the police station and crosses the street.
          
          INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT
          
          CLOSE on fingers typing on a keyboard.
          
          A computer screen shows Walter's image -- the photo just
          taken of him against the blue background. Words appear across
          the screen as they are typed, creating an Internet
          notification page:

          We MOVE in on the photo of Walter till it fills the frame.
          
          FREEZE FRAME. All sound fades out.
          
          The title "THE WOODSMAN" fades in.

          INT. OFFICE - NIGHT
          
          Walter sits in a small windowless office with his coat still
          on. He looks at someone off screen.
          
                                   MAN (0.S.)
                         So. How are you adjusting?
          
                                   WALTER
                         I'm adjusting okay.
          
                                   MAN (O.S.)
                         And your new apartment?
          
                                   WALTER
                         Apartment's okay.
          
                                   MAN (O.S.)
                         Are you taking your medication?
          
                                   WALTER
                         It gives me headaches.
          
                                   MAN (O.S.)
                         But you are taking it?
          
                                   WALTER
                         Yeah.
          
          Across from Walter, sits ROSEN, young, awkward and clearly
          new to the profession, jotting something down in a notepad.
          
                                    ROSEN
                         Good. I'll talk to your physician
                         about the headaches. Maybe he can
                         change the prescription.
          
          Walter doesn't say anything.
          
                                   ROSEN (cont'd)
                         And how's your job?
          
                                   WALTER
                         The job's okay.

                         Do I take "okay" to mean you feel
                         good about working there?
          
                                   WALTER
                         I said the job is okay.
          
                                   ROSEN
                             (smiling)
                         That's right, you did.
                              pause)
                         Have you made any friends there?
          
                                   WALTER
                         I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.
          
                                   ROSEN
                             (pause)
                         You seem a little hostile today.
          
                                   WALTER
                         That was a joke.
          
          Rosen jots something on his notepad. Walter reaches over and
          taps on the notebook.
          
                                   WALTER (cont'd)
                         It's called sarcasm, Dr. Rosen.
          
                                   ROSEN
                         No need to call me doctor. I'm a
                         therapist, not a psychiatrist.
          
                                   WALTER
                         It's all the same.
          
          Rosen looks at Walter for a long moment. Walter avoids his
          gaze.
          
                                   ROSEN
                         Walter, I'd like you to try
                         something for me.
          
                                   WALTER
                         What?

                           I'd like you to keep a journal.
          
                                        WALTER
                           A diary?
          
                                     ROSEN
                           That's right.
          
                                        WALTER
                           No way.
          
                                        ROSEN
                           Why not?
          
                                     WALTER
                           Diaries have sent too many guys to
                           prison.
          
                                     ROSEN
                           I don't understand.
          
                                     WALTER

                           Oh. It never crossed my mind.
          
                                        WALTER
                           Of course.
          
                                     ROSEN
                           It was just an idea.
          
                                        WALTER
                           Bad idea.
          
                                     ROSEN
                           I thought a journal would encourage
                           you to reflect.
          
                                        WALTER
                           Reflect.
          
                                     ROSEN
                           That's right.

                           You think reflection is good.
          
                                     ROSEN
                           It's very good, indeed.
          
                                     WALTER
                           How's that?
          
                                     ROSEN
                           By reflection we can derive a
                           deeper meaning from our experience
                           in life. We gain greater
                           understanding about ourselves that
                           can lead to making better choices
                           in our relationships, our careers,
                           and our goals.
          
          Walter looks at him flatly.
          
                                     WALTER
                           You read that in a book.
          
          Rosen blushes.
          
                                     ROSEN
                           Try it.
          
                                     WALTER
                           No fucking way.
          
                                     ROSEN
                           Then think about it.
          
          Walter is silent.
          
          EXT. PHARMACY, STRIP MALL - NIGHT
          
          The sidewalk is crowded with pedestrians. Walter heads
          towards the pharmacy entrance, but he is abruptly cut off by
          a group of kids zooming by on their scooters and skateboards.
          He pauses for them to pass, watches after them momentarily,
          then proceeds inside.

          INT. PHARMACY - NIGHT
          
          Walter hands a prescription to a MALE PHARMACIST. The
          pharmacist looks at the prescription. He glances at Walter
          then goes over to a FEMALE PHARMACIST working in the back
          area.
          
          She reads the prescription, glances at Walter over her
          bifocals, then back at the prescription. Walter has not
          missed any of this.
          
                                    WALTER
                         There a problem?
          
                                        MALE PHARMACIST
                             problem?
          
          A middle-aged shopper talking on her cell phone nearby looks
          over and pauses in her conversation.
          
                                   WALTER
                         Can you read the prescription?
          
                                        MALE PHARMACIST
                         Yes.
          
                                   WALTER
                         Can you fill the prescription?
          
                                        FEMALE PHARMACIST
                         Yes.
          
                                   WALTER
                         Then I suggest one of you move your
                         ass, because if I don't get my
                         medication I get extremely violent.
          
          The male pharmacist scrambles to fill the prescription.
          
          The shopper gasps. Walter looks at her and smiles. The
          shopper stuffs her items in her cart and quickly leaves.
          
          Walter stifles his grin.

          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
          
          Walter opens the door to his apartment, carrying a grocery
          bag. As he flips on the lights, a metal object is thrown
          across the room. He catches it with one hand. It's a can of
          beer. A man laughs.
          
                                     CARLOS (O.S.)
                           You still think fast.
          
          Carlos sits at the table with a six-pack. Walter sets the bag
          on the table and pops open the can.
          
                                     WALTER
                           Don't need to think fast to handle
                           beer.
          
                                     CARLOS
                            ook some talking to convince your
                           super I was a relative.
          
                                     WALTER
                           I told her all my relatives are
                           good-looking.
          
          Carlos laughs.
          
                                     CARLOS
                           Jesus Christ, man, it's good to see
                           you!
          
          Carlos stands and they awkwardly embrace.
          
                                     CARLOS (cont'd)
                           You look good, damn good,
                           considering you're an old man now!
          
                                     WALTER
                           Seems like the whole world's gotten
                           younger.
          
          There is silence. Carlos sits back down at the table and
          opens another beer.
          
          Walter starts unpacking the groceries.

                                   CARLOS
                         Booming. Lots of building going on.
                         We can't keep up with all the work.
                         In fact, I just hired a few new
                         guys...
          
          Glancing at Walter, he realizes his blunder.
          
                                   CARLOS (cont'd)
                         Just until we catch up.
          
          There is a brief silence as both men drink. Carlos looks at
          Walter.

                           had to prove yourself.
          
          Carlos gets up and walks over to the window. He gazes
          outside.

                           hundred feet of where children
                           congregate. I figure the distance
                           from my window to the school is one
                           hundred and twenty. Make a bet?

          Slowly the SOUND of children fades in and a red ball bounces
          to Walter's feet. He looks in the direction the ball came
          from.
          
          Nothing is there.
          
          Walter looks back down at his feet. The ball is gone. The
          sound of children fades back away and is replaced by a
          rhythmic squeak. Walter looks towards the playground where an
          empty swing sways back and forth in the wind, the chain
          squeaking in its hinges.

          There is a tremendous crash as logs are dropped near the wood
          chipper. Forklifts move and stack wood.
          
          Walter stands at the end of a wood chipper, pushing a long
          piece of wood through. Suddenly above the din of machinery
          there is the sound of raised voices.
          
          Walter looks across the way to see Vicki yelling furiously
          and smacking a GUY around the head with her work gloves. The
          man cowers, protecting his head from the blows. Some other
          men nearby are doubled over in laughter.

          Vicki lies in bed, relaxed, smoking a cigarette. The sheets
          are pulled to her waist.
          
          Walter enters and sits on the side of the bed. He smiles
          shyly at her.
          
                                   WALTER

          Walter looks at her. Vicki laughs and nudges him in the butt
          with her foot.

                           sound off-the-wall, but I like to
                           sleep with a man after we fuck.

                           When I do sleep, I sweat a lot.
                           Usually I get nightmares and wake
                           up screaming.

          Walter stands by the window watching Vicki walk towards her
          Jeep. Something brushes his leg. He looks down to see the red
          ball resting by his foot. He turns to see...
          
          A glimpse of a young girl as she flashes by the door. She is
          twelve years old and wears a white nightgown.
          
          There is the sound of a car HONK, and Walter looks out the
          window to see Vicki pull away.
          
          He looks back toward the girl. There is nothing there.

          Walter rummages through a drawer. From underneath a pile of
          clothes he pulls out a well-worn notebook. Walter leafs
          through the pages. They are filled with writing but towards
          the back the pages are blank.
          
          INT. APARTMENT - DAY
          
          Walter sits next to the window watching birds play at the
          bird feeder. The notebook sits next to him on the windowsill.
          
          There is the SOUND of children playing outside. Walter opens
          the notebook, closes it, then opens it again. He looks up and
          sees his reflection in the window. He starts to write.
          
                                   WALTER (V.O.)
                         I watch the kids arrive at school.

          Continued from previous journal scene. Walter sits at his
          windowsill writing in his journal. There is the sound of
          children arriving to school outside. He looks up.
          
                                   WALTER
                         But for the last few weeks I've
                         noticed someone else watching them.
          
          Walter's POV: The man with the white Volvo stands leaning
          against his car watching a bus load of children arrive. He
          pops M&Ms in his mouth.
          
                                   WALTER (CONT'D) (CONT'D)

                         He talks to the boys, fifth and
                         sixth graders. He goes for the
                         pretty ones, faces like angels.
          
          Walter finishes writing then looks outside.
          
          INT. BUS - MORNING
          
          Walter stands on a crowded bus, staring out the window at the
          landscape rushing by. The bus pulls to a stop. Passengers get
          off, then a group of girls come crashing onto the bus. They
          overflow with energy and giggles.
          
          Walter squeezes back so they can get by, but the bus lurches
          into motion throwing one of the girls into Walter. He helps

          She and her friends burst into laughter and move on past.
          
          Walter watches her move down the aisle then quickly turns
          away, scanning the faces surrounding him. No one looks at
          him.

          Walter sweats heavily as he works. Vicki walks by and glances
          at Walter as she passes. He doesn't notice her.
          
          INT. WAREHOUSE CAFETERIA - DAY
          
          Walter sits at a table eating. Vicki sits down across from
          him. They eat silently. Walter doesn't look up. Vicki blows a
          straw wrapper, hitting Walter in the face.
          
           fter a moment, without glancing up, Walter retaliates. Vicki
          smothers a laugh. Walter cracks a smile.
          
           ary-Kay sits across the room watching the flirtation between
          Vicki and Walter.
          
          INT. WAREHOUSE BATHROOM - DAY
          
          Vicki exits a stall and goes to the sink to wash her hands.
          She's smiling a little smile to herself.
          
          Mary-Kay enters and starts primping in the mirror, fixing her
          hair, putting on lipstick. She watches Vicki in the
          reflection of the mirror.

                         The new man. I'd keep away from
                         him, if I were you.

                         damaged goods -- real damaged

                         Thanks a bunch for the advice.
          
          Mary-Kay smiles, missing Vicki's ironic tone.
          
                                   MARY-KAY
                         Just trying to be helpful.

                         Well, Mary, you're about as helpful
                         as a broken sewer pipe. You do know
                         what runs out of a sewer pipe,
                         don't you?
          
          Mary-Kay's smile withers into a sneer.
          
                                   MARY-KAY
                         Suit yourself.
          
          She drops the lipstick into her bag and exits.
          
          Vicki turns and finishes washing her hands, glancing at
          herself in the mirror.
          
          EXT. WAREHOUSE - LATER
          
          Walter exits the building amidst a group of men. He walks
          towards the bus stop. Vicki hollers to him from her Jeep.
          
                                    VICKI
                         Hey.
          
          Vicki waves him over.
          
          INT. DINER - NIGHT
          
          Vicki sits across from Walter in a booth. She takes a large
          bite from a burger and washes it down with a milk shake.
          
          Walter folds his napkin over his hand to make a little rabbit
          hand puppet. The rabbit nods at Vicki.
          
          She busts out laughing.

          Walter and Vicki play pool. She knocks two balls into a
          corner pocket. She is kicking his ass and visibly enjoying
          it.
          
          Walter hands her a quarter. Vicki kisses him on the cheek and
          goes to line up the next shot.

          Vicki's hair.
          
          INT. WALTER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Vicki and Walter have just finished making love, Vicki on
          top. She lies down on his chest. He strokes her hair, then
          leans his head close and takes a deep breath.
          
          INT. WALTER'S BEDROOM - MORNING
          
          Vicki is woken up by Walter who makes the moaning sounds of
          someone having a nightmare. She turns on her side and watches
          him.
          
          Walter wakes up with a start, then sees Vicki and cuddles
          close. She runs her fingers through his hair and kisses his
          forehead.
          
                                      VICKI

          He closes his eyes again. Vicki looks at him closely.

                         What happened to you?
          
          Walter opens his eyes. Vicki continues to stroke his hair.

           here's a long pause. He rests back down against the pillows.

                         What's the worst thing you ever

                         I mean my best friend since the
                         second grade. Her husband was hot
                         for me and, god, he was cute. She
                         was an international flight
                         attendant, so we would get it on
                         for days, while she was off in some
                         country we couldn't pronounce. Then
                         he told her, the shit. It broke up
                         our friendship, broke up their
                         marriage. Later she had a nervous
                         breakdown, quit her job, then moved
                         in with her sister who she
                         despised.

                           she was twelve. I always asked how

                           The judge had a thing about sex
                           offenders. Later I heard his
                           daughter had been raped. If I
                           hadn't had a good lawyer, it would
                           have been twenty-five to thirty.

          Vicki gets up and pulls on her clothes. She looks at Walter
          who sits motionless on the bed. She leaves.

          Vicki drives fast. Window down. Cigarette gripped between her
          fingers. Tears stream down her face. She comes to a stop
          light and sits completely still, staring ahead without
          blinking. Suddenly cars HONK. She snaps out of her stupor and
          keeps on driving.
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
          
          Walter sits on the couch writing in his journal. The TV is
          on, a baseball game in progress, sound on low. Abruptly,
          Walter throws the journal across the room. Then he lies back
          and stares at the ceiling.
          
          Suddenly, there is a loud THUMP outside of the apartment.
          
          Walter picks up his journal and puts it in a drawer, then
          walks quietly to the door and opens it a crack.

          Carlos enters the apartment and sets a table down in the
          middle of the room. Walter looks at it.

                         It's made from cherry. That's a
                         hard wood.
          
                                   CARLOS
                         It's a nice table.
          
          Walter runs his hand along the surface.

          Carlos sits in a chair.
          
                                   WALTER
                         It's my own design. You won't find
                         another table like it in the world.

                         I'm not afraid. I'm just saying
                         that Carlos has a thing for his
                         daughter, and if he isn't careful

                         day out there, and I was thinking -
          
          Walter wipes his mouth and gets up.
          
                                   WALTER
                         Excuse me. Got another load coming
                         in.
          
          Walter exits. The smile fades from Mary-Kay's face.
          
           icki watches Walter leave.
          
          EXT. WAREHOUSE - DUSK
          
          Walter stands alone at the bus stop.
          
           icki gets in her Jeep and pauses before turning on the
          engine, watching Walter.
          
          He turns his back to the cold wind and her.
          
          Vicki turns on the car and pulls out of the lot, roaring by
          Walter without looking at him.

          Vicki moves around her apartment, cigarette in one hand,
          spray bottle in the other, squirting her plants.

          She prunes dead leaves from one of them, then pauses looking
          at the leaves in her hands.

          She aggressively squirts the little plant with water, then
          pauses, noticing her reflection in the window. She looks at
          herself long and hard.

          There is a knock on the door. Walter walks through the room
          to the door, tucking in his shirt as he walks. He cracks the
          door.
          
          Vicki stands outside. Walter opens the door.

          Walter looks at her.
          
          INT. VICKI'S CAR - A LITTLE LATER
          
          Walter and Vicki drive without saying anything. Slowly the
          city-scape gives way to countryside. Walter looks over at
          Vicki. She stares ahead.
          
          EXT. RESERVOIR - DAY
          
          Walter and Vicki get out of the car which is parked on the
          edge of a reservoir surrounded by a thick pine forest. Vicki
          works her way down to the water's edge. A Great Blue Heron
          skims across the water's surface.
          
          Walter watches her for a moment then follows. He sits down
          near her.
          
           icki lights a cigarette and stares out over the water. After

                         Don't be sorry for me. I did those
                         things. No one else did. I'm
                         dealing with that.

                         My father took me fishing here when
                         I was a kid. He could name every
                         fish in the lake. And for every
                         fish he named, he had a fishing
                         story. I hated fishing, but I loved
                         his stories.

                           place. Cheap five-year-lease. The
                           loan was in the bag. My wife was a
                           hundred percent behind it.
                           Everything was set... Then I got in

          Walter sits at his table, a scrap of wood in his hand. He
          whittles away at the wood. It is the rough outline of a heart
          with wings.
          
           here is a loud KNOCK on the door. Walter gets up. The KNOCK
          comes again, even harder.
          
          Walter goes to the door and opens it. The smiles fades from
          his face.
          
           ergeant Lucas pushes the door open further and walks right
          in. He wears a well-tailored suit.

                            I could say you jumped when I came
                            in. Who are they going to believe?
                            Not you, because you'd be a dead
                            piece of shit.
          
          Beat. Lucas taps Walter onL the forehead and smiles.

                            being a good boy, Walter. Okay?
          
          Walter is silent. Lucas taps him again.
          
                                      LUCAS (cont'd)

                                (flatly)
                            Okay.
          
          Lucas rises, spits his gum in the sink, and leaves.
          
          Walter leans   over squeezing his head tight between his hands.
          The sound of   children fades in and Walter looks up. The girl
          with the red   ball stands across from him in the doorway to
          his bedroom.   She smiles and bounces the ball.
          
          Walter folds over, cradling his head in his arms.
          
          EXT. WALTER'S APT. - DAY
          
          Walter stands alone at his bus stop. As he waits, he sees the
          white Volvo turn a corner and pull up in front of the school.
          
           he bus pulls up to the stop, obscuring Walter's view. He
          quickly gets on and moves to the back, looking for Candy's
          car. It is nowhere in sight, the place where it had parked,
          empty. Walter sits down and stares ahead, numb.
          
          EXT. MALL - DAY
          
          It's a bright Saturday afternoon. A city bus turns into the
          parking lot of a large mall. Passengers exit the bus and pour
          into the mall's entrance. Walter is among them.

          INT. MALL - DAY
          
          Music blares from speakers. Packs of teenagers cruise the
          mall. It is alive with chatter.
          
                                      WALTER (V.O.)
                            I don't know why I did it.
          
          Walter is frequently jostled, as if he has forgotten how to
          navigate crowds.
          
                                      WALTER (V.O.) (cont'd)

          INT. BOOKSTORE - DAY
          
          The bookstore is two floors and vast. Walter looks lost as he
          moves through the crowds.
          
                                                                  UT TO:
          
          Walter rides an escalator. Three girls stand ahead of him.
          The girl closest to him wears a short skirt which flutters
          above Walter's face. He looks up.
          
                                      WALTER (V.O.)
                            She was pretty. Very pretty.
          
           hey reach the next level and Walter watches the girl walk
          away with her friends. Suddenly, the girl looks back. Their
          eyes lock -- briefly. She W
                                    turns the corner.
          
                                      WALTER (V.O.) (cont'd)
                            She gave me a look. If she hadn't
                            given me that look...
          
          Walter pauses, then follows.
          
          The girl separates from her friends and goes down an aisle.
          Walter follows her. She goes down another aisle. He follows.
          
                                                                (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          
          In the middle of the aisle, the girl bends down, looking at
          titles. From the end of the aisle, Walter pretends to be
          looking for a book as he edges closer to her. He's now a few
          feet away. The girl pulls out a book and opens it. Walter
          gazes at the nape of her neck.
          
                                   SALESMAN (O.S.)
                         Can I help you find something?
          
          Walter turns, startled.
          
          Behind the salesman, Walter sees a security guard exit the
          rest room area.
          
                                      WALTER
                         No, I'm --
          
          He turns, the girl is gone. He bolts the other way, through
          the aisles, down the elevator, through the mall as fast as
          possible. The faces are a blur, sound becomes distorted. Then
          we hear --
          
                                   ROSEN (O.S.)
                         Did she know that you were
                         following her?
          
          INT. ROSEN'S OFFICE
          
          Walter sits in Rosen's office.
          
                                   WALTER
                         I don't know.

          Walter is agitated. Rosen calmly writes.

          Rosen stops and looks at Walter.

                         I spend the rest of my life in

                                   ROSEN
                         Is this the first one?
          
                                   WALTER
                         Of course it is! That's why I'm
                         telling you!

                         I want you to calm down.
          
          With effort Walter settles down.
          
                                   ROSEN (cont'd)
                         You followed a girl. One girl.
                         Perhaps you wanted to see what it
                         felt like after so many years.
                         Maybe unconsciously you were
                         testing yourself. You followed her
                         and nothing happened. And here you
                         are talking about it with me. This
                         is positive.
          
          There is a pause. Walter looks down, unconvinced. Rosen
          checks the time.

                           girl, be near a girl, even talk to
                           a girl... and walk away.

          something, he looks up.
          
          A GIRL sits across from Walter. She is about twelve years
          old. She wears glasses and a pair of binoculars hangs around
          her neck. She casually nibbles on food she produces from her
          backpack. She glances at Walter briefly then looks back out
          the window.
          
          Walter turns away.

                           problems.

          Vicki jogs down the stairs and over to her Jeep. She opens
          the door.
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - CONTINUED
          
          Walter pulls the carving he was working on from a drawer and
          looks at it. It's finished.
          
          Vicki reenters holding a plant and sets it loudly on the
          table. Walter looks at her then at the plant.
          
                                   WALTER
                          hat's this?

          She gets herself a beer from the fridge.
          
                                   WALTER
                         I don't need a plant.

                         Everyone needs a plant. This ivy is
                         one tough baby. It's a cutting from
                         one of mine.
          
          Walter seems at a loss. Vicki takes a swig from her beer.

                         Here's the deal. Give it a little
                         water. Go easy on the direct
                         sunlight. And notice it every once
                         in a while. They love it when you
                         look at them, or touch their
                         leaves. Can you handle that?
          
          Walter looks unconvinced.

          Vicki turns. He tosses her the carving.
          
          Vicki catches it and looks at it for a long moment, then at
          Walter.

          There is the usual morning chaos in the locker room. Walter
          opens his locker but stops abruptly.
          
            aped to the inside of his locker is a magazine ad of a young
          girl, joyfully swinging on a swing. Scrawled over the image
          in red marker is a circle with line across it and the words
          "WE'RE WATCHING YOU" written below.

          Walter quickly tears down the picture and looks around. The
          men are all oblivious.

          INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
          
          Walter works at the saw, watching closely every person that
          walks by him. No one pays him any mind.
          
          Bob, the boss, walks into the space and stops to have a few
          words with a worker who points in Walter's direction. Bob
          heads towards Walter.
          
          Walter sees him coming and pauses in his work. Bob walks
          right by to talk to another man working behind Walter.
          
          Walter watches for a moment then continues working.
          
          INT. WAREHOUSE - LATER
          
          Walter exits the mens room and stops to drink from the water
          fountain. Mary-Kay is walking down the hall and pauses.
          
                                   MARY-KAY
                         Hi, Walter. How ya doing?

                         Well, I've got this problem. I
                         promised my sister that I'd baby-
                         sit her little girl tonight while
                         she's on a date. Single mother,
                         right? Her daughter's a cute little
                         thing, about nine or ten. Real
                         entertaining. But once she's
                         asleep, I get soo bored. I'd love
                         to have some company.
          
          She gives Walter a suggestive look.

                           That's not a helpful answer.
          
                                     WALTER
                           That's my answer.
          
          Rosen looks at Walter.
          
                                     ROSEN
                            lose your eyes.

                           What?
          
                                     ROSEN
                           I'd like you to close your eyes.
          
                                       WALTER
                           Why?
          
                                       ROSEN
                           To relax.

                           I'm relaxed.
          
                                     ROSEN
                           Close your eyes and let your mind
                           be blank.
          
                                     WALTER
                           Hey, Rosen, you going to hypnotize
                           me?
          
          Walter laughs.

                           I'm all yours. Do it, Rosen.
          
          Rosen gets up so he's positioned directly in front of Walter.
          
                                     ROSEN
                           When I say the word "girl" what is
                           the earliest image that you can

                           No. When I say the word "pretty,"
                           when I say the word "pleasure,"
                           what is the earliest memory you

                           In your mind, Walter. Take your
                           time.
          
          After a moment, Walter's expression shifts.

          Rosen is excited by this "breakthrough."

                         Anna will be away at camp. The
                         house will be quiet. It's better

                           The important thing is that you and
                           Annette need to talk. She needs to

                           You're a good man, Walter. Okay,
                           you did some wrong things, but
                           inside you're a good, decent man.

                           Maybe I'm not a good man. Maybe

          The waitress interrupts to clear the table, leaning over to
          grab the empty plates. Carlos checks her out.

                           Young girls wearing mini this and
                           mini that. Sometimes when I walk
                           down the street and pass some sexy-
                           looking woman, she makes me feel
                           like I'm bothering her. She stares
                           down like she's afraid to look at
                           me. Why she do that? Why can't she
                           look me in the face?

                           Maybe because you're looking her in
                           the face.

          A look of horror/disgust passes over Carlos's face, and he

          Carlos lets go of Walter roughly and gets up and leaves.

          Vicki stands before Walter who sits on the edge of the bed.
          Both are naked. She kisses him. He turns her around and pulls
          her to his lap.
          
          Walter's hands are on her hips. He moves her body slowly --
          very slowly -- around his lap.
          
          Vicki goes with it, enjoying herself, then tries to turn
          around. Walter holds her still.

          He leans his face into her hair. He takes deep audible
          breaths. Vicki tries to turn again, but he won't let her. She
          is aroused but confused.

                         The match is about to begin. Candy
                         enters the arena looking sweet and
                         trim. He checks out the scene but
                         plays it cool. He's definitely
                         holding back.
                             (Pause)
                         Uh-oh, Candy's eyes have locked
                         onto something. Oh yeah.
          
           railing behind the others is the angel-faced boy. Freeze
          frame.

                         A cherub of a lad has separated
                         from his friends. Candy quickly
                         makes his move. He pats the cherub
                         on his head, ruffles his hair. With
                         his other hand, he offers the boy a
                         bag of M&Ms. Jumbo size.
          
          Che boy tears open the bag.

          Candy points across the street to his white Volvo.
          
                                   WALTER (V.O.) (cont'd)
                         A very risky move by Candy. The boy
                         looks at the car but walks away!
          
          Candy follows the boy. Freeze frame.

          Candy struts around the boy rapping, clapping, snapping his
          fingers.
          
                                   WALTER (V.O.) (cont'd)
                         I have never seen Candy act so
                         cocky.
          
          Candy points to his car again, then dances, seen in slow-
          motion, toward it.

                         The cherub looks at Candy; the
                         cherub looks at the car; the cherub
                         looks for his friends. But his
                         friends are long gone. The cherub
                         is alone. The cherub crosses the
                         street!
          
          Candy opens the car door.

          INT. WALTER'S APT. - DAY
          
          Walter sits staring out the window. The sound of children
          playing.
          
           icki walks into the room and sees Walter sitting by the
          window. She walks up behind him and puts her hands on his
          shoulders.

                           What are you doing?
          
          Walter turns around, startled, brushing her off.
          
                                     WALTER
                           Don't do that.
          
                                      VICKI
                           Do what?
          
                                     WALTER
                           Sneak up behind me like that.
          
                                     VICKI

          Vicki looks at Walter.

                            I need a shower.
          
          He walks back into the bedroom.
          
          A SCHOOL BELL rings and Vicki looks out the window. She sees
          the children running into school. She looks back in the
          direction Walter left.
          
          INT. VICKI'S CAR - DAY
          
          Vicki and Walter ride in the car. Vicki glances at Walter. He
          stares ahead, then leans his head back and closes his eyes...

          INT. BUS - DAY
          
          ... Walter rides, head back, eyes closed. The bus comes to a
          stop and a couple of passengers get on. Walter opens his
          eyes.
          
          The girl with binoculars comes to sit in the seat ahead of
          Walter.
          
          Walter stares at the girl. The bus pulls up to another stop --
          it is Walter's. The doors to the bus open. Walter looks at
          the doors, he does not move. The doors close. He looks back
          at the girl. The bus drives on.
          
          EXT. BUS-STOP - DAY
          
          The bus comes to a stop. The girl gets off amongst a couple
          of passengers. Walter follows.
          
          EXT. PARK - DAY
          
          Walter walks down a path that opens onto a secluded little
          field surrounded by trees.

          The girl stands in the middle of the field looking at the sky
          through her binoculars. She turns slowly, scanning the trees.
          She spots Walter and lowers the binoculars.

                         A little higher.
          
          She points her binoculars up. Walter walks towards her.

                           They're extremely aggressive birds.
                           Plus, their habits are rather
                           filthy.

                           of birds you'll see here. Last week
                           I saw a purple martin. And the week
                           before that, I saw a solitary
                           vireo. That's rare.

          There's a loud KNOCK at the door. Walter looks over in
          surprise. The KNOCK comes again. Walter quickly closes his
          journal and puts it in a drawer. The KNOCK comes again.

                         Sure they do. But outside they've
                         got trees around them. The trees
                         shade them from the sun. Of course,
                         the plants enrich the soil around
                         the trees. One of nature's

                           call Henry, told me about his last
                           victim. Henry says how he's in the
                           bedroom of a seven-year-old cutie
                           named Adele. Her mother's in the
                           living room watching TV. She's got
                           the volume on so damn high he can
                           hear David Letterman's jokes. Henry
                           puts his hand over Adele's mouth
                           and says, "If you scream, little
                           girl, I'll kill your mother." And
                           of course little Adele doesn't
                           scream, doesn't cry, doesn't make a
                           sound. Then he takes her hand and
                           out they go through the front door.

                           I don't know.

                           Sure you do. He cuts open the
                           wolf's stomach, and the girl steps
                           out alive.

                           jumps out of the wolf's guts with
                           hardly a scratch.
                               (pause)
                           Ever see a seven-year-old girl
                           sodomized almost in half?
          
          Walter shakes his head.

                           She looked so small and broken. I
                           saw hardened twenty-year veterans
                           cry. They cried like babies. I was
                           there. Ain't no fucking woodsman in
                           this world.
          
          Lucas takes out a fresh piece of gum and pops it in his
          mouth. Then he rises.

          Lucas stares coldly at Walter, his face red. He looks
          dangerous.

                           scum like you return to the
                           streets. It just means we've got to
                           catch you all over again.
          
          He slaps Walter on the back of the head...

          ... and exits.
          
          Walter rushes to the blinds, drawing them down, then
          scrambles to get his journal from the drawer. He drops to his
          knees, tearing the pages from his journal, tearing them to
          bits.

                           not!
          
          The SOUND of children fades in, and Walter looks up.
          
          In the bedroom doorway is the girl in her white nightgown,
          sitting on the red ball, rocking back and forth, her chin in
          her hands.

          Walter rides the bus. He is unshaven and looks exhausted. He
          is jostled by the crowds but seems oblivious.

          -- the locker room. A hush suddenly falls over the room.
          Walter looks around. No one will meet his eyes. He opens his
          locker and a piece of paper slides out.
          
          It is a Xerox of the police notification information of
          Walter printed from the Internet.
          
          Walter stares at the paper. Suddenly something slams next to
          his head. A piece of metal clangs to the floor. Walter turns
          around.
          
           edro stares at him, surrounded by a number of men.
          
          Vicki stands in front of her locker holding the flyer. She
          looks scared. She glances at the men then walks over to
          Walter.

          He looks up at the trees.
          
          INT. VICKI'S CAR - DAY
          
          Vicki drives, the bag on the passenger seat. She comes to a
          stop light and looks in the rear view mirror.
          
              cop car pulls up behind her.
          
           icki reaches over for the bag and stuffs it under the seat.
          
          The light turns green. Vicki drives slowly. The cop changes
          lanes and passes her. She lets out her breath.
          
          EXT. STREETS MONTAGE - SAME TIME
          
          Vicki slowly drives by a series of parks, schools, malls -
          searching.

          Children abound, playing, running free, getting off of school
          buses, running to meet their parents. There is no sign of
          Walter.
          
          EXT. PARK - DAY
          
          The girl walks into the clearing, wearing her binoculars
          around her neck. She stops when she sees Walter sitting on
          the bench.
          
          Walter continues staring at the trees. She walks over to him.

                            See anything interesting?

                            Not yet.
          
          The girl sits on the bench and pulls a small book from her
          backpack. She starts writing in it.
          
          Walter watches her.          W

                           no people or dogs or ugly crows and
                           pigeons. It's quiet except for the
                           song of these tiny sparrowlike
                           birds. Would you like me to take
                           you there?

                           They could be finches. I don't

                           No.
          
          Her answer has a strange effect on Walter, as if for a moment
          he has lost his balance. Carefully, he sits down and stares
          at his hands.             W
          
                                      WALTER
                           Why not?
          
          She is quiet.
          
                                     WALTER (cont'd)
                           Are you two alone when he asks you?
          
          Still silent.
          
                                     WALTER (cont'd)
                           Does he touch you?
          
          Robin looks through her binoculars.
          
                                     WALTER (cont'd)
                           Does he say strange things?
          
          She scans the trees.
          
                                     WALTER (cont'd)
                           Does he move his legs in a funny
                           way?
          
          Robin drops her head and quietly sobs. Walter looks at her
          but makes no effort to comfort her.
          
                                     WALTER (cont'd)
                           Have you told your mother?
          
          She shakes her head.

                           talk to?
          
          She is quiet.

                           Is there a teacher you like at
                           school?
          
          She nods.

                           Ms. Kramer.
          
                                     WALTER
                           Tell Ms. Kramer what your daddy
                           does.
          
                                      ROBIN
                           I can't.

                           Yes you can, Robin.
          
          Robin in silent.

                           You said you couldn't make the
                           sound of a solitary vireo. But you
                           did. Beautifully. I heard you.
          
                                     ROBIN
                           What will happen if I do?

                           Someone will talk to your daddy.
                           And then he'll stop doing those
                           things... the things you don't
                           like.
          
          Tears come to Robin's eyes again.

                                     WALTER
                           I know because... it's just
                           something I know.

                           Robin, listen to me.
          
          She looks at him. Walter struggles to find the words.
          
                                     WALTER (cont'd)
                           At first he'll be upset... very
                           upset. It's because he'll realize
                           he's been a bad daddy. Then he'll
                           try... He'll try very hard to be a
                           good daddy... People will say
                           stupid, ignorant things about your
                           daddy. That will be hard for you...
                           But one thing I know for sure,
                           he'll always love you... always.
          
          There is a long moment of silence.

                           lap?

                           Go home, Robin.
          
          Robin gets up, goes over to Walter, and hugs him. Walter
          starts to put his arms around her but refrains.
          
                                     ROBIN
                           Bye.
          
          She runs off. Walter looks out, numb.

          
          EXT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
          
          Walter approaches his building. The white Volvo sits parked
          across the street in front of the school. Walter walks a
          couple of more steps when the door to the Volvo opens. Walter
          freezes.
          
          Candy gets out of the car. As he turns, Walter no longer sees
          Candy but himself -- many years younger.

          Walter watches, fear and emotion coursing through his face.
          
          Young Walter leans back in and pulls the front seat forward,
          and a young girl emerges.
          
          Flash to the angel-faced boy getting out of the car. Candy
          pats him on the head.
          
          Walter sees young Walter pat the girl on the head. She runs
          off down the street.
          
          Walter races towards Candy.
          
          Candy tucks his shirt in, puts the seat back, and is about to
          get in the car when Walter calls out --
          
                                   WALTER
                         Hey!
          
          Candy whirls around. Walter smashes him in the face. Candy
          reels backwards hitting the car. Walter attacks Candy full
          force. As he punches flashes of young Walter appear, then
          Candy, then young Walter again.
          
          He pounds and pounds on Candy then finally pulls away.
          
          Candy sputters on the ground.
          
          Walter, breathing hard, stares at Candy. He looks at the
          blood on his hands, which shake uncontrollably. He slowly
          stands up and starts to back away.
          
          Candy rolls over and groans as he tries to raise himself.
          
          Walter turns, tucks his head down, and quickly walks away.

          Walter stands in the living room. He looks down at the floor
          where the journal was and sees that nothing is there. He goes
          to his windows and lowers the blinds.
          
          EXT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          her nail, staring off into space. The phone sits next to her.

          Walter stands in the shower. He turns the water on and lets
          it run over him. Slowly, he begins to sob.
          
          INT. WALTER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Walter stands at the bureau, cleaned up and dressed in fresh
          clothes. He looks up and stares at himself in the mirror. The
          sound of TRAFFIC fades in.
          
          EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT
          
          Walter walks down a city street with boarded up store fronts.
          The sidewalks are wet from a steady drizzle. Cars pass by on
          the wet pavement.
          
          As Walter walks, we intercut with a SERIES OF FLASHBACKS:
          
          A) EXT. SCHOOL - Walter looks at the blood on his hands then
          at Candy moaning on the ground.
          
          B) EXT. PARK - Robin stands in the middle of the field,
          binoculars held to her eyes, scanning the trees.
          C
          
           ) EXTREME CLOSE-UP: Robin lowers the binoculars and stares
          us straight in the eye.
          
          EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT
          
          Walter stands at an intersection. The lights play across his
          face.
          
          FLASHBACK
          
           ) EXT. COP CAR - NIGHT - Walter's face slams against a cop
          car. His hands are cuffed behind him, and he is roughly
          frisked. He tries to look back over his shoulder but his face
          is held down.
          
          E) EXT. PARK - Robin dances in circles in the fields, arms
          stretched out as if she is ready to fly.
          


                                                                   108.
          
          
          
          EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT
          
          A car races by, and Walter walks along a busy street fast.
          The rain falls harder now.
          
          FLASHBACK
          
           ) EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT - Walter gets place in the back of the
          cop car. The cops get in the front seat. Walter looks out the
          window at his house as the car pulls away.
          
          Standing on the front steps, his wife turns away, carrying
          his daughter inside. A cop closes the door behind them.
          
          G) EXT. SCHOOL - Walter pounds and pounds on Candy.
          
          EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT
          
          Walter crosses an old brick bridge that spans a river.
          
          FLASHBACK
          
           ) EXT. PARK - Robin twirls and twirls, then slowly dissolves
          into the girl with the red ball and white nightgown. The girl
          spins and spins, her dress fluttering in the wind. Slowly the
          girl fades away so the field is empty, except for a number of
          small birds fluttering around the ground.
          
          EXT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
          
          Walter stands outside Vicki's door. After a moment he knocks.
          The door opens to show Vicki. She stares at Walter.

          Through the window we see Vicki sit down on the couch, and
          Walter sit on the coffee table, facing her. He starts to talk
          and takes her hand. She pulls it away. He continues to talk
          and takes her hand again, not letting her pull away.
          
          Trucks pass by over the wet pavement, rattling the windows.
          
          EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY
          
          The school is quiet, the playground empty. Swings sway
          listlessly in the breeze.

          The old Chevy pulls into the parking lot.
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - DAY
          
          Walter brings his duffel bag into his living room and sets it
          down next to a clothes hamper. Boxes are scattered about the
          space. There's a KNOCK on the door.
          
                                        WALTER
                           It's open.
          
          The door opens and Lucas enters.
          
          Walter pauses.                L

                           Hi ya, Walter.
          
          Walter automatically sits down in the chair.
          
                                     WALTER
                           What can I do for you, Sergeant
                           Lucas?
          
          Lucas walks over to the window.
          
                                     LUCAS

                           I'll be asking the questions.

                           man was badly beaten across the
                         street. You know anything about
                         that?

                         You said last night. I went to bed
                         pretty early.
          
                                   LUCAS
                         The assault took place at
                         approximately seven thirty.
          
                                   WALTER
                         I went to bed around seven.
          
          Lucas gives him a look.

                         I wasn't feeling well.
          
                                   LUCAS
                         I could take you downtown.
          
                                   WALTER
                         You could. It'd be a waste of your
                         time, though.
          
          Walter starts folding his clothes and placing them in the
          duffle bag.

                           I suppose if you're looking for a
                           male between the ages of thirty and
                           fifty, medium height, medium
                           weight, medium build. Probably not
                           too many men fit that bill.

                           Just give me a straight answer,
                           Walter, cause the irony goes right
                           over my head.
          
          Lucas walks around. Walter folds a shirt.

                           I'd say you're moving.

                           Unfortunately, the victim can't
                           talk. In addition to his other
                           injuries, his jaw is broken.

                           victim. Turns out he's wanted in
                           Pennsylvania. He raped a boy there.

          same pair of socks.

          is low on the horizon. Walter wears a pressed button-down
          shirt. He is clean-shaven and his hair neatly combed. His
          hand fidgets in his lap.

           icki's POV: Walter and a woman stand in the distance near
          the water. The woman looks a few years younger than Walter.
          There is space between them. Walter faces her, but she looks
          out at the water. After a long moment, he reaches to touch
          her arm.
          
          The woman pulls away and yells something at him. Walter's
          head drops.
          
           icki lights another cigarette. She flips on the radio to
          country music, blocking out all sound. She looks back out the
          window.
          
          The woman yells angrily then falls quiet -- staring at
          Walter. After a long moment, she turns and walks back up the
          hill to her car where Carlos waits, leaning against the car.
          Annette gets in the car, slamming the door. Carlos pauses,
          looking at Walter, then gets in the car and turns on the
          engine to leave.
          
          Walter stays standing near the water.

                         I saw my sister.
          
          INT. ROSEN'S OFFICE
          
          Walter sits in his usual seat across from Rosen.
          
                                   WALTER
                         It was hard.
          
          Rosen is silent.
          
                                   WALTER (cont'd)
                         She's still really hurt... and
                         angry. I don't know... if she will
                         ever... forgive me.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                 115.
                                   WALTER(cont'd)
          CONTINUED:
                         I understand that. I do. I just
                         hope... I just want her to...
          
                                   ROSEN
                         Accept you?
          
          Walter nods.
          
                                   ROSEN (cont'd)
                         It's going to take time, Walter.
          
                                   WALTER
                             (to himself)
                         Time.
          
                                   ROSEN
                         How do you feel about that?
          
                                   WALTER
                         I feel... okay.
          
          Walter looks at Rosen who nods. There is a moment of silence
          between them.


          
          THE END
