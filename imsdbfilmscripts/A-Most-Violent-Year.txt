          JANUARY 31, 1981
          Over black we hear the opening of a garage door. The light
          spills in and we see.
                         
                         
          EXT. UPPER MIDDLE CLASS RESIDENTIAL HOUSE, QUEENS NYC -
                         SUNRISE
                         
          Open on ABEL MORALES. It is early morning and still almost
          dark out. He has a rugged yet prosperously-handsome face and
          is in his mid-thirties. He is struggling to get started with
          his morning jog.
                         
                         
          EXT. SHIP GRAVEYARD, STATEN ISLAND NYC - DAY
                         
          It is early morning. A large bulk fuel oil transport truck
          sits idling next to a decrepit old dock. The dock sticks into
          a backwater section of New York harbor that is filled with
          the decaying remains of half-sunken abandoned barges and tug
          boats.
                         
          JULIAN, the young driver of the truck sits and nervously
          scans the horizon. Eventually a large fuel barge appears in
          the distance being pushed by a tug boat. The barge is steered
          past the skeletons of the other sunken ships and makes its
          way to the dock in front of the tanker truck.
                         
          JULIAN gets out of his truck and readies a large connecting
          hose. He looks around nervously. JULIAN steps across the
          broken boards of the dock and struggles to get the hose to
          the barge. He hands it to the BARGE OPERATOR with a nod of
          the head and no words.
                         
          They connect the hose and start a large generator as it
          begins to pump fuel into the truck. They both scan the
          horizon again as the sun begins to come up.
                         
                         
          EXT. MORE INDUSTRIAL QUEENS NEIGHBORHOOD- SAME TIME
                         
          ABEL is still jogging as the light begins to increase. It is
          freezing out. He is a very serious guy. He is not happy that
          he is out of shape. Finally he stops and bends over to catch
          his breath. We have run with him from the nicer part of the
          neighborhood to a rougher section. As he catches his breath
          he stands up and looks around. He is unsure of his feelings.

          INT. ANNA'S DRESSING AREA
          The camera slowly moves in as ANNA sits in a slip at her make
          up table putting on her face for the day ahead. She looks
          into the mirror as if she is putting on a coat of armor.
                         
                         
          INT. DRIVER'S CAB OF A BULK OIL TRANSPORT TRUCK - DAY
                         
          STANDARD HEATING OIL, "We set the Standard" is written in
          logo form on the side of the tank.
                         
          The truck idles in traffic waiting to pay the toll to cross
          the Verrazano bridge that spans the mouth of New York harbor.
                         
          JULIAN, the young driver from the dock, cautiously looks
          around as the traffic inches along. He finally approaches the
          toll booth and pays.
                         
                          JULIAN
           Good morning.
                         
          JULIAN speaks English with a well-sanded accent. Is it
          Central American or Mexican? The female collector gives him a
          smile.
          He heads through the booth, but there is still traffic on the
          other side as the lanes merge together. Just as the traffic
          is about to pick up he looks in his rearview mirror and we
          see TWO GUYS come walking through the traffic and towards the
          cab. Before we know it they are climbing up the cab steps.
                         
          The GUY on the driver's side, LOUIS SERVIDIO, is small and
          very slight but he moves with great speed and strength. He
          shatters the glass side window with his elbow. Unlocks the
          door just as his partner, THUG #2, does the same thing on the
          passenger side, but he is holding a gun. They are not wearing
          masks. It's very brazen.
                         
          Before THUG #2 even asks JULIAN to get out of the cab LOUIS
          SERVIDIO crushes him in the jaw with three swift punches then
          pulls him out of the cab and down onto the roadway.
                         
          LOUIS SERVIDIO pulls the door shut and they drive away with
          the truck leaving JULIAN sitting in the middle of the road
          staring, as blood starts to flow from his jaw.
                         
                         
          INT. PARKING YARD OF STANDARD HEATING OIL- SAME TIME
                         
          Two almost-matching late model Mercedes pull up to a chain-
          link gate with a small sign that says "STANDARD HEATING OIL:
          WE SET THE STANDARD". The DISPATCHER opens the gate.
                          4
                         
                         
          They both pull into reserved parking spaces next to each
          other. ABEL is dressed in a very tasteful custom made suit.
          ABEL's wife ANNA was driving the car behind him. She is a
          beautiful, tall, blonde woman dressed to the nines but with a
          streak in her eye that this is all business. You would not
          want to cross this woman.
                         
                          ABEL
           Ready?
                          ANNA
           Yes.
                         
                          ABEL
           You look very nice.
                         
                          ANNA
           Thank you.
                         
                          ABEL
           You sure?
                         
                          ANNA
           Yes.
                         
          ABEL walks around and opens his trunk. He takes out two large
          empty briefcases.
                         
          He carries the briefcases as they both walk over to a large,
          unmarked, armored van that is idling in the middle of the
          parking lot. Two ARMED GUARDS get out of the van. One is
          holding a clipboard. He walks up to ANNA and ABEL. He hands
          them the clipboard. They look at each other one last time and
          then both sign the document.
                         
          The other GUARD opens up the back of the truck. ABEL hands
          him the briefcases and the guard begins to fill them with
          cash. Lots of cash. ABEL and ANNA stand at the open back of
          the van and just watch. Finally he finishes and hands the now-
          heavy cases to ABEL.
                         
          ABEL picks up the two cases and walks a bit away from the
          truck. He turns to ANNA.
                         
                          ANNA (CONT'D)
           Don't do anything stupid.
                         
                          ABEL
           We don't have any more money so
           what else could I do.
                         
          She gives a small smile. He looks at his watch. They kiss.
                          5
                         
                         
          ABEL turns and begins walking with the cases. He gives a nod
          to the DISPATCHER, who we now see, is in a small gatehouse,
          and he begins to open the front gate.
                         
                         
          EXT. STREET OUTSIDE THE FRONT GATE- SAME TIME
                         
          ABEL walks out through the gate and down the abandoned
          industrial street about 25 yards, then looks to his right. He
          looks down at the cases in his hands, turns, and stands
          looking into the neighboring site.
                         
                         
          EXT. MASSIVE OIL TANK FARM: BROOKLYN NY WATERFRONT - DAY
                         
          ABEL comes walking across the parking lot and sees ANDREW
          WALSH standing in the middle of the dusty parking lot. ANDREW
          is their longtime LAWYER/RIGHT-HAND MAN and is in his mid
          fifties. He is smart but tired. The oversized briefcase in
          his left hand seems to have permanently tilted his posture
          that direction. The large oil-holding tanks loom above them.
          The place is rusting and could use some work.
                         
          As they wait, the setting has the look and choreography of an
          illegal transaction about to go down.
                          ANDREW WALSH
           So how are we this morning?
                         
                          ABEL
           (gives a smile and nod)
                         
                          ANDREW WALSH
           Well I woke up feeling very good
           about this.
                         
                          ABEL
           Really?
                         
          They both take a look at their watches.
                         
                          ABEL (CONT'D)
           You've been telling me not to do
           this for a year.
                         
                          ANDREW WALSH
           Well we are going all in... so now
           I love it.
                         
          Gives him another slight smile. They stand around in awkward
          silence. Finally a late-model Ford Ltd. station wagon pulls
          into the lot.

           Here we go.
          And a group of FIVE HASIDIC JEWS gets out. There are two guys
          in their twenties, two in their fifties, and one in his mid-
          to-late seventies. They all shake each other's hands then
          stand around for a beat.
                         
           ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D)
           Should we head inside?
                         
          INT. SMALL TEMPORARY OFFICE TRAILER - DAY
                         
          The group is now jammed around a folding table inside the
          trailer. ABEL and his lawyer sit at one end facing the rest
          of them. Finally, the senior member of the group, JOSEPH
          MENDELSOHN, eyes up ABEL and leans forward. His accent is
          strong yet you can understand every word.
                         
                          JOSEPH
           So why is it you want this land?
                         
                          ABEL
           I'm sorry?
                          JOSEPH
           It has been difficult for you to
           get me here, no? Over a year?
                         
                          ABEL

                          JOSEPH
           There are many like it around? And
           thanks to all these tests you paid
           for, we now know it is as much of a
           mess below the ground as it is
           above. My people have looked at
           your books, I know this is a lot of
           money for you, so why have you kept
           on us so... just for this ugly and
           polluted little piece of the earth.

           I have been looking over my fence
           at this property for a very long
           time.
                         
                          JOSEPH

           No... I imagine I want it for the
           same reason you did.
                         
                          JOSEPH

           To grow.

           Well, I am in the garment business
           so I appreciate that sentiment. But
           I inherited this land from my
           uncle. Sadly he had no children of
           his own. He was the one that let
           them build these tanks here. So
           this place can do little for me...
           in fact thanks to all those tests
           you've done it may be a liability.
           As you know I offered to lease the
           site to you at a fair price, but
           you were not interested?
                         
                          ABEL
           No.

           Why not?
                         
                          ABEL

           I want you to know this up front. I
           am a very fair man but I believe in
           honoring contracts. You will
           fulfill your end of this contract
           and the property is yours. If you
           can't we will keep your money and
           will sell it to your competitor who
           has been chasing us almost as badly
           as you have. I like you, but know
           that the only reason I am choosing
           you is because of the favorable
           terms of this contract. So this is
           business... and when you sign
           this....

          ABEL turns to ANDREW and gives a slight nod. ANDREW pulls the
          black briefcase onto the table and opens it. It has seven
          hundred thousand dollars in cash in it. He slides it over to
          their side. The old man signs the contract and they shake
          hands.

           Well, it was a hell of a job just
           getting them to this point. It's a
           good day for us. Take a walk
           around. Enjoy it for a second.
                         
          ANDREW gets in his car and drives away. ABEL looks around and
          decides to go for a little walk.

          He heads out towards the tanks and walks among them. They
          tower seven stories above him. As he walks, he is cut off
          like a maze from any other visual input. (Similar to being
          inside a Richard Serra sculpture) Finally he emerges into
          some light and as ABEL looks up the camera reveals his view.
          It's midtown Manhattan in all its glory, just across the East
          River from the site. He stares at the city and we see the
          true depths of his ambition lock on his face. He looks to his
          watch.

          ABEL's car drives into a long driveway through the woods.
          Then an architect-designed, 80's modern house, still under
          construction, appears. He pulls up in front.
                         
          He gets out of the car and stands there looking at the large
          house. He walks into the house and we see more clearly that
          it is nearing completion. It is empty.

          walking in behind him.

          ABEL reaches into his jacket pocket and takes out a thick
          envelope of cash. As he does we see a transformation of his

          ABEL stands, surrounded by massive trees in the thick forest,
          looking across the ridge back at his house. He is a little
          out of breath after climbing the hill but he looks strangely
          comfortable even though he is standing in the woods in a
          suit, tie, and dress shoes. He takes a nice cigar out of his
          pocket, lights it and has a real moment of joy. He looks up
          to the tops of the trees, then back at the new house. He
          exhales a long deep breath. Then we hear a large truck come
          rumbling in the driveway. He hears it. His face shows that he
          knows the sound immediately.

          parked in the driveway. His face shows it probably isn't
          great news.

          ABEL comes down a hallway and then turns through a curtain
          into a treatment area. Sitting on the table is the young
          driver of the truck, JULIAN.
                         
          He has a contraption on his head that is holding his jaw shut
          in place. His eye is black. ABEL goes over and gives him a
          tight hug. But then he ever so slightly checks himself and
          places him back down on the table.
                         
          ABEL looks up and sees ANNA, standing in the corner. She is

           brought him in.

          They stare at each other, then the truck. ABEL then climbs up

          The cop leaves. ABEL is left standing on top of the truck in
          the parking lot alone with his battered truck. He looks down

           around in this city, just trying to
           do their jobs. And I... I have done
           everything you have asked of me.
           It's been two years since you first
           started investigating my company
           and I have spent thousands of
           dollars hiring lawyers for this and
           that to provide you with every
           piece of information your office
           has requested. And I expect that
           you have been asking the same from
           my competitors. So with all this
           information that you have gained...
           We are just asking if you have any
           idea who has been doing this to us?

           although everyone else seems to
           have given up and left this city
           for dead, I haven't. And as you
           know we have been investigating
           industry-wide corruption in your
           business that seems to have been
           going on for years. And the simple
           fact is that the only person who
           could do anything with 8000 gallons
           of heating oil in a matter of
           minutes after stealing a truck is
           someone from within that industry.
           And almost certainly someone with
           local storage capacity. So you're
           right. That means you all are
           stealing from each other. Which is,
           as far as I can tell, just a
           refreshing new take on what you've
           been doing to your customers and
           fellow taxpayers for the last
           fifteen years.

           First, please know that we respect
           the work you are doing to try to

           away in the simplest and most
           economical way possible with the
           limited resources at my disposal.
           It doesn't really matter to us who

           I can't go into specifics at this
           moment but we believe that you and
           your company have broken the law

           prove that. So next week, Monday

          him.
                         
          He gets himself over to the side of the road. We have a
          slight fear it might hit him. But as it passes we see it's a
          large moving truck. There's a second one following right
          behind it.

          As the trucks pass it registers on ABEL's face. He cuts into
          a path in the woods.
                         
          EXT. DRIVEWAY
                         
          ABEL walks up to his house, and we see the moving trucks
          preparing to unload. ANNA gets out of her car with the kids,
          and they run around and check out the house as ANNA directs
          the movers.
          ABEL comes up and stands next to her. They smile a protected
          smile at their new home. ABEL gives her a kiss.
                         
                         
          INT. DINING ROOM OF NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          The whole family sits around the table in candlelight. They
          are eating takeout, but with a mismatch of formal and
          everyday tableware that has been unpacked. There are boxes
          all around them.
                         
                          ANNA
           I know it has been a long road, and
           that not all of you wanted to do
           this, but thank you. For me...
                          ABEL
           A toast.

                          ABEL (CONT'D)
           A toast to our new home. It's as
           beautiful as my wife and daughters
           and as strong as me...(kids laugh)
           May we be happy, prosperous and

          INT. GYMNASIUM GIRLS YOUTH SOCCER GAME - NEXT MORNING
                         
          ABEL is standing watching the game as he waits for his coffee
          to come out of the snack bar. Over his shoulder we hear...
                         
                          PETER FORENTE
           So you made the move?
                         
          ABEL turns and sees PETER FORENTE standing there. He's in his
          mid-forties, very well-dressed, and handsomely bald.
                         
                          ABEL
           Peter... it's official as of

           Sir.
          ABEL picks up his coffee, and they both walk back over to the
          sideline together. Although they are standing a bit off to
          the side from everyone else.
                         
                          PETER FORENTE
           So I heard about your rig getting
           picked off again.
                          ABEL
           Yes.
                         
                          PETER FORENTE
           We should probably get together to
           discuss this and go over some of
           the preventative measures that
           we've been taking. We haven't had
           an incident since November. It
           doesn't do any of us any good to
           have this kind of attention brought
           to us.
                         
          They both stare out at the court for beat.
           PETER FORENTE (CONT'D)
           So I think I may have seen one of
           your new trucks the other day.
                         
          They look at each other.

                          PETER FORENTE
           The driver looked like a member of
           the Hitler Youth. I haven't seen a
           teamster that blond and blue-eyed
           since I was a kid.
                         
                          ABEL
           He's from Ohio. Played football. I
           like my drivers to fit in with the
           neighborhood...

           That's new territory for you, no?

           old clients from in the city.
                         
          PETER gives a bit of a stronger look. Then finally turns back
          towards the field.
                         
                          PETER FORENTE

          INT. GARAGE OF THE NEW HOUSE - DAY
                         
          The garage is filled with boxes. ABEL stands in the middle of
          a few that are partially unpacked. He has set up an old radio
          in the corner of the garage, and it is playing a New York
          Giants football game. ABEL takes an object out of one of the
          boxes and looks at it with significance.
                         
          Coming from the main house we hear the doorbell ring. ABEL'S
          oldest daughter, ANNIE, comes to the door of the garage.
                         
                          ANNIE
           Dad. Mr. Walsh is here.
                         
          ABEL looks around behind ANNIE to see ANDREW standing there.
          He waves him into the garage. The boxes are stacked almost
          to the ceiling around them.

                          ABEL
           It's not set up yet... So I am
           guessing this isn't good news here
           on a Sunday night.
                          ANDREW WALSH
           No... It looks like they are coming
           after us.
                         
                          ABEL
           That describes many people at this
           point.
                         
          Slight smile.

           How bad?
                          ANDREW WALSH
           I still haven't seen it yet. But my
           guy in his office just gave me a
           heads up an hour ago. It's not
           good.

           A couple places?
                         
          This hits ABEL. He thinks for a beat than goes over to the
          door to the house and calls for his wife.

          He is making light of the situation, but as she looks at
          their faces she knows there is a problem.

           We follow standard industry
           practice on every front.
                         
          They all give each other a long look, as this means they have
          been bending the rules in several places, as do all their
          competitors.

                          ANDREW WALSH
           It means we may have some
           accounting exposure where we have
           pushed things a little too far.

           You always told us to push until we
           couldn't push any further. Well, we
           may have hit that line. So we will
           handle it and move on.

           standard industry practices. We
           aren't even sure what this is yet.
           I just wanted to make sure you had
           all the information I do. This is a
           badge of honor, it means we are big
           enough to give a shit about now.
           Don't worry.

          ABEL reaches into his pocket and takes out a remote for the
          automatic garage door opener. As it opens you can see the
          pride in his face as this remote is a fairly high-tech new
          item. They all sit and watch as it opens the whole way then
          stops in silence.

                          ANDREW WALSH
           There is real concern about their
           safety.

           The drivers are feeling
           unprotected.
                          ANNA
           Because they are.
                         
                          ANDREW WALSH
           I just think you should talk to
           them about it. Before it grows into
           something.
                         
                          ABEL
           Okay.

           Good night.
                         
                         
          INT. ABEL AND ANNA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          ABEL is lying in bed, awake. ANNA is as well. He is staring
          at the ceiling. Their dog is lying at the foot of the bed
          asleep as well. Eventually the dog wakes up and looks out
          towards the doorway. He growls ever so lightly. Then he
          stops, listens, and starts growling a little more.
                         
          ANNA looks up ever so slightly.
                         
                          ANNA

          ABEL is now standing up to go look.
                          ABEL
           Quiet... don't worry. It's nothing.
                         
          ANNA tries to go back to sleep.
                         
                         
          INT. HALLWAYS/KID'S ROOMS - NIGHT
          ABEL walks out of the bedroom and slowly heads down the hall
          to his kids' rooms. He looks in each room and the CHILD is
          sleeping soundly with nothing out of place.
                         
                         
          INT. KIDS' ROOMS/HALLWAY- SAME TIME
                         
          As he comes out of the last bedroom back into the hallway he
          sees his dog standing at the top of the stairs looking down
          over the balcony into the living room. The dog is starting to
          quietly growl once again.
                         
          ABEL'S face goes from total comfort that his kids are safe to
          total paranoia. He slowly walks down the hall. He stops off
          in his bedroom closet and grabs a mid-size baseball bat/billy
          club. Now he is heading down the stairs with the club trying
          not to freak himself out.
                         
                         
          INT. OPEN LIVING ROOM/ENTRY HALL/FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
                         
          ABEL walks down the stairs and the dog just stands at the
          top, still growling every now and then. ABEL comes into the
          living room and everything seems perfectly normal. He then
          relaxes and turns towards the dog.
                         
                          ABEL
           Quiet. It's nothing. Come down
           here.
                         
          He snaps his fingers and calls the dog. The dog finally comes
          down the stairs.
                         
          ABEL now heads towards the kitchen in a relaxed state, but
          then the dog starts growling again and looking out the
          windows next to the front door. ABEL comes over, he opens the
          front door but the dog refuses to go out.
                         
                          ABEL (CONT'D)
           Go. Oh come on. Go.
                         
          ABEL thinks he hears something. He clicks on the lights and
          pulls his bat back up into position. He heads outside.
                          35
                         
                         
          EXT. FRONT DOOR TO ABEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          ABEL comes to the end of the front walk and there is nothing.
          The dog has now followed him outside and is slowly heading
          over to a area where a small exterior hallway leads to a side
          entrance. It is dark. The dog starts barking and going crazy.
          ABEL slowly heads over to the covered passageway.
                         
          All hell now breaks lose. A BURGLAR, in all black, comes
          blasting out of the shadows. The dog tries to bite him as he
          goes by. ABEL swings his club and hits BURGLAR square on the
          shoulder but he keeps coming. He knocks ABEL over and runs
          towards the driveway. ABEL is up and chasing after him faster
          than we expect.
                         
                         
          EXT. BASE OF THE RAVINE DEEP IN WOODS- CONTINUOUS
                         
          There is a pretty good moon out so we can see them running
          full throttle through the very thick woods. ABEL is keeping
          up with him and in fact may be gaining on him.
                         
          ABEL is still in his pajamas. He has a rage that has been
          building up inside him for a good two weeks that is now
          pouring out of him in the energy to chase this guy down.
          They come to the top of a small ravine which ABEL seems to
          know from his runs through the woods and ABEL takes a bit of
          an easier/quicker path down.
                         
                         
          EXT. WOODS BEHIND ABEL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          ABEL now cuts him off at an angle and swings the bat at his
          legs. BURGLAR trips and goes flying. ABEL falls as he swings
          at him. They both sit on the ground for a beat. ABEL is
          exhausted. They stare at each other.
                         
          A brief look of panic comes across BURGLAR's face. Then he is
          up again and running off into the woods.
                         
          ABEL gets himself up and chases after him.
                         
                         
          EXT. ROAD NEXT TO THE WOODS - NIGHT
                         
          ABEL comes out of the woods into the middle of the road, and
          in the distance we see BURGLAR run up to a waiting van with
          its lights and engine on. The guy gets into the passenger
          side of the van, and it peels out.
                         
          ABEL is left standing in the middle of the road, barely able
          to breathe and holding the bat.
                          36
                         
                         
          EXT. ABEL FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
          ABEL comes walking back towards his front door. ANNA is
          standing with all the lights on and with the dog sitting next
          to her. She looks at him in shock.
                         
                          ANNA
           Where were you?
                         
                          ABEL
           (looking to the dog)
           A lot of help you were.

           Abel?
                         
          They both look down at his bare feet. He has been in some
          kind of shock and hasn't even noticed that his bare feet are
          cut up to pieces from running in the woods through the ice.
          His feet are bleeding all over the walkway.
                         
                         
          INT. POWDER ROOM OF ABEL AND ANNA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          ANNA is in warrior mode. Any panic in her voice has
          disappeared, and she is speaking with a calm yet deadly
          seriousness. She is cleaning the cuts on his feet and putting
          bandages on them as they talk.
                         
                          ANNA

                          ABEL
           What do you mean, how am I supposed
           to know who it was?
                         
          She gives him a look.
                         
                          ABEL (CONT'D)
           I don't know.
                         
          She gives him another look.
                         
                          ABEL (CONT'D)
           I think it was just some punk,
           looking to rip us off.
                         
                          ANNA

                          ABEL
           Ouch! If they had wanted to send a
           message he could have... and he
           didn't.

           Seems like a message was sent loud
           and clear.
                         
                          ABEL
           Please. Don't get going on this. We
           are a big new house. He probably
           wanted the TV. He didn't have a
           gun, he had nothing. The alarm will
           be in on Monday. It was some kid.
           They aren't coming back.
                         
          She looks at him with considerable concern.
                         
          He leans in and starts kissing her. She holds still at first
          then gives in.
                         
                         
          INT. TRAINING ROOM AT STANDARD HEATING OIL - NEXT MORNING
                         
          ABEL is in a suit but is kneeling and almost lying on his
          back showing three SALES RECRUITS what they should be looking
          for. Another INSTRUCTOR looks on. We see ABEL in his element.
          He is a salesman.
                         
                          ABEL
           What you are looking for here is
           the opening to the burn chamber.
           Now at this point you have not
           tipped your hat in anyway. From the
           minute you walked in the house you
           should have been working to create
           an impression of total
           impartiality. But now...
                         
          He reaches over and opens the small door. A fire is burning
          inside. On cue the instructor hands ABEL a crisp clean white
          handkerchief.
                         
                          ABEL (CONT'D)
           When this door opens you begin to
           close. It must always be spotless.
           If they see you have ever done this
           before it is over.
                         
          He takes it and reaches up into a small exhaust chimney.
                         
                          ABEL (CONT'D)
           Now, you do this and only this...
           You look down at the cloth and
           don't say a word... You just keep
           staring at the cloth and then you
           slowly just start shaking your
           head. Very very slowly and small.

           Don't look up at them. Just at the
           cloth.
          Then ABEL makes a small clicking noise.
                         
                          INSTRUCTOR

                          ABEL
           It means you are close... Then
           after sitting in silence way longer
           than is comfortable, you turn. And
           say "I'd love to run a few numbers
           for you. Is there somewhere more
           comfortable we could sit." They
           will almost always take you to the
           dining room table and will offer
           you something. And whatever it is
           you always take the fancy option.

                          ABEL
           Because, we are never going to be
           the cheapest option, so we have to
           be the best. And they want... no,
           need... to feel that you want the
           best too. That's why our trucks are
           the newest or cleanest, and our
           drivers are approachable.
                         
          Just then the woman who works behind the front desk (STANDARD

           I gotta go, but the final point I
           will make is the hardest one. Once
           you have done the math and shown
           them what we can save them over the
           long haul through proper
           maintenance, you need them to sign.
           And the problem is by hiring you
           that means they are firing someone
           else. And that's never easy. So to
           get them over the line you need to
           close them. So when you show them
           the number look up at them both...
           and just stare at them...
                         
          ABEL begins staring at the recruits. He continues to stare.
                         
                          ABEL (CONT'D)
           You stare longer than you should.
           Because this is not a joke. You
           will only keep this job if you
           close. And that's not funny to you.
           And I am only interested in this
           company growing, and when it isn't
           I don't think it's funny at all.
           These people work very hard for
           their money and these other guys
           are ripping them off, treating them
           poorly, because they don't know...
           so when you look them in the eye
           you have to believe that we are
           better, and we are, but you will
           never do anything as hard as
           staring a person straight in the
           eye and telling the truth.
                         
          ABEL then does exactly that to them. And he holds it for a
          long beat.

          There is a great high/low nature to the way ABEL runs the
          company. While he wears great suits and his trucks are
          impeccable, he does not waste money. So this room where the
          drivers have company meetings is very basic.

          The room is filled with all of the drivers. There is a bit
          of a nervous energy in the room. It quiets as ABEL comes in.
          He stands aside.

          As STANDARD FRONT DESK sees ABEL standing behind her, she
          stops. ABEL walks forward a few steps.
                          ABEL
           Good morning. First off, I picked
           up Julian yesterday and he is back
           home and doing much better. And I
           just wanted to make sure you are
           all aware that we are doing
           everything we can to deal with this
           situation. We are working with law
           enforcement, and they seem to be
           closing in on these guys. But,
           sadly these are the times we are
           living in and we must rise above
           them. So, on that front we have
           these.
          He puts one of the new radios on the dais. ANDREW comes into
          the room behind ABEL and stands.

           These will be in every truck by the
           end of the week. Much to my wife's
           concern I spent some serious coin
           and we now have our own closed

          ANNA is walking back from the mailbox looking through the
          day's mail. As she approaches the house she looks up and sees
          the two younger daughters, ELIZABETH (6 years old) and
          CATHERINE (4 years old), playing in front of the house.
          CATHERINE comes out from under a bush near the side door with
          something in her hand.
                         
          ANNA looks back down at the mail. As she gets closer to the
          house we see a look of concern come across her face. The look
          then turns to one of complete horror but as she gets closer
          to CATHERINE she tries to control her emotions.
                         
                          ANNA
           Catherine... Catherine. Katie!
                         
          She drops the mail. And goes right up to her daughter.

           Mommy.
                         
          As ANNA comes up to CATHERINE we now see that the little girl
          is holding a large very real looking handgun in her little
          hands. ANNA is besides herself.

           It's quite simple for me: I can't

           consider most sacred.
                         
                          ABEL
           I agree. But these are truck
           drivers, not soldiers, this will
           lead to chaos.

           You seem to be under pressure from
           many sides right now... which I
           understand. Trust me I understand.
           So let me think this through. But
           whatever decision I make on this,
           it stands. Those men show up every
           morning for you because I tell them
           to. It's important for you to
           realize that these are very
           dangerous times, and we need to
           adapt. It's not like when we were
           driving.

           Sometimes the weak man is the
           stronger man if he has the right
           tools.

           It may seem that way... but if you
           are weak eventually it will show...
           it always does. And if you want
           this to all be behind us, help me
           find out who is doing this. You
           know a lot of people, and that
           would be the most help to me.

           That depends what they do with it.

           That depends what they do with it.
           If they kill their wife with them,
           then no. Then that is a very fake
           permit, and I'll walk away very
           quickly. But they just need to show
           that they are defending themselves,

           guys shoots somebody it's me they
           will bring down for it...I'll talk
           to him... And we need to close this
           deal. We can't stay like this any
           longer. We must close on that

                          ARTHUR LEWIS
           So how are you?
                          ABEL
           We've been better... but we are
           good.
                         
                          ARTHUR LEWIS
           Yes I heard about that... if you
           stay in business long enough it's
           bound to happen eventually.
                         
                          ANNA
           Well that's exactly right. And we
           wanted to sit down with you tonight
           to make sure we were being totally
           up-front with everything that is
           going on and make sure that you
           understand the nature of the
           complaints and are comfortable that
           it is not going to affect our
           business in an adverse way.
                         
                          ANDREW WALSH
           Did you have a chance to look over
           the outline that I sent over?
                         
                          ARTHUR LEWIS
           Yes, we did.

                          ANNA
           Hopefully it made clear that even
           in a worst case situation we will
           pay off any and all fines and be
           able to move forward with very
           comfortable capital on hand.
                         
          ABEL jumps in taking some offense.
                         
                          ABEL
           But you should know Arthur that
           this man has been digging through
           our industry for over two years
           looking for anything he can find.
           And as you know probably better
           than anyone, having worked with
           some of our competitors the thought
           that he would have singled us out
           is ridiculous. It reeks of
           everything that is wrong with this
           city right now. We run a fair and
           clean business and follow every
           standard industry practice and I
           will fight `til my last day to
           prove that...
          This silences the table for a long beat.
                         
                          ABEL (CONT'D)
           But... but...
                         
          ABEL holds up his finger and points at ARTHUR across the
          table to make his point.
                         
                          ABEL (CONT'D)
           ...Don't think for a moment that I
           am going to allow this mess to
           interfere with our plan to grow. We
           need to know you are standing by
           us.
                         
           BANK VP IAN THOMPSON
           Yes, what is it with this piece of
           property that you find so integral
           or that can't be put off `til after
           this legal matter is dealt with?
                         
          ABEL is a little taken aback by this comment. It goes against
          everything that comes naturally to him as a person. ANNA and
          ANDREW know this and are concerned he might go off.
                         
          ABEL thinks it through.
                          60
                         
                         
                          ABEL
           That's a very good question. This
           property gives us many things...
           firstly direct access to the river.
           So I can bring in fuel directly
           from any provider in the world
           straight to my tanks, then it has
           over 10 million gallons of storage
           capacity, so I can buy in the
           summers when my price is low and
           sell to my customers and most
           importantly some of my competitors
           when the price is high. I won't
           just drive trucks anymore... I will
           control my fate... but the real
           answer to your question...
                         
          Now ABEL stares right at IAN THOMPSON.
                         
                          ABEL (CONT'D)
           ... is that when it feels scary to
           jump Ian... that is exactly when
           you must jump... or you risk ending
           up staying in the same place your
           whole life... and that I can't do.
          IAN THOMPSON awkwardly laughs a bit as ABEL just stays deadly
          serious staring right at him. Finally.
                         
                          ARTHUR LEWIS
           We've always been there with you
           and know that we will continue to
           be.
                         
                         
          INT. ABEL'S CAR - NIGHT
                         
          ABEL is driving, and ANNA sits in silence looking out the
          passenger window. They are heading along the main backwoods
          road to their house.
                         
                          ANNA
           Well, that went about as well as
           could be expected.
                         
                          ABEL
           Yes. Arthur is a good man.
                         
                          ANNA
           Do you think they will close?
                         
                          ABEL
           Of course.
                          61
                         
                         
          Just as he says this a deer comes running out in front of
          them. ABEL tries to slam on the brakes but isn't able to stop
          in time. The car hits the deer and it careens over the
          windshield and on to the road behind the car.
                         
          He continues to slam on the brakes and comes to a complete
          stop.
                         
          They both catch their breath and look around to make sure
          they are both okay. Then they look back at the deer. It is
          laying on the road but is still breathing.
                         
                          ABEL (CONT'D)
           Are you okay?
                         
                          ANNA
           Yes... you need to go put it out of
           its misery.
                         
                          ABEL
           Jesus.
                         
                          ANNA
           I mean it. We can't just leave it
           here.
                         
          EXT. BACKWOODS ROAD - NIGHT
                         
          ABEL gets out of the car and looks at his smashed hood. He
          then walks back and approaches the animal. It is laying on
          the side of the road.
                         
          He comes right up to it and stares into its eyes. It stares
          back at him. ABEL walks back to the car.
                         
                          ANNA
           Is it dead?
                         
                          ABEL
           No.
                         
                          ANNA
           Well you need...
                         
                          ABEL
           I know.
                         
          He reaches down to open the trunk.
                         
                          ANNA
           What are you doing?

           Getting the tire iron!
          This whole situation has stressed them out and they are on
          edge.
                         
          ABEL goes to the trunk and gets out the large wrench. He
          walks back over to the deer. He bends down next to it and
          stares into its eye again. ABEL is thinking back on
          something, or many things.
          He makes a small starting movement like he is going to hit it
          over the head but he stops himself. He can't quite do it.
          Then he sits with the animal a beat longer.
                         
          We come in very close to ABEL and see his hand is struggling
          to deliver the blow. Just as he grips the tire iron
          waiting... BANG! BANG!
                         
          Two very loud GUNSHOTS go off from right over his shoulder.
          He ducks for cover then slowly turns behind him. ANNA stands
          there holding a small-yet-powerful Saturday Night Special-
          style handgun. Smoke is still rising from the end of the
          pistol. The deer is dead.
                         
          He looks at her dumbfounded... where did she get this gun?
          She gives him a look. Then turns and walks back to the car.
          He stays and struggles to get the deer out of the road.
                         
                         
          INT. ABEL'S DAMAGED CAR - NIGHT
                         
          ANNA is sitting in the car waiting. We hear ABEL'S footsteps
          as he approaches the open driver's side door. He gets in
          without saying a word. We stay with them as they drive on in
          silence.
                         
                         
          INT. MORALES HOUSE, FRONT HALLWAY - NIGHT
                         
          The door opens and ABEL walks in. ANNA is already in the
          house talking with NANNY MARIA who's been baby-sitting.
                         
                          ANNA
           Hello Maria, sorry we are a bit
           late. They were fine?
                         
                          NANNY MARIA
           Oh yes. All is good.
                         
                          ANNA
           Great, thank you. We'll see you in
           the morning then.
                          63
                         
                         
                          NANNY MARIA
           Okay.
          NANNY MARIA comes around the corner and passes ABEL who is
          just standing in the living room. He only gives her a nod.
          ANNA is standing on the other side of the room just waiting
          in silence as well. NANNY MARIA goes over to the closet and
          gets her coat out and puts it on. The tension is building
          like a kettle. Finally NANNY MARIA gets herself together and
          walks out and as the door shuts they come immediately at each
          other.
                         
                          ANNA
           What?
                         
                          ABEL
           What?
                         
                          ANNA
           Yes... what?
                         
                          ABEL
           Are you kidding?

           No.
                          ABEL
           Okay then... what is this gun?
                         
                          ANNA
           I told you I wasn't going to just
           continue to stand around and let
           these people come and get me and my
           children. So unlike you who seems
           to be totally comfortable just
           standing around like some...
           fucking pussy... I did something
           about it.
                         
          ABEL is slightly stammering at this point, not quite sure
          what to do. They are still standing on opposite sides of the
          room from each other. He just waits... finally.
                         
                          ABEL
           Where did you get it?
                         
                          ANNA
           You know where I got it.
                         
                          ABEL
           Do you have a permit?

                          ANNA
           Not yet.
          This sets him off. He comes walking across the room at her as
          if he might hit her. He gets closer and closer.
                         
                          ABEL
           You must be a bigger fucking idiot
           than I even thought. You are trying
           to protect your children? Protect
           them? Do you have any idea what
           happens if you get caught using
           that thing?
                         
          He is now standing right over her.
                         
                          ABEL (CONT'D)
           You dress yourself up in these
           fancy clothes, and look at you here
           in your mansion. I've given you
           everything you could possibly want
           but you still can't stop thinking
           like the Brooklyn corner-store
           gangster's daughter that you are.
                         
                          ANNA
           You've given me? You? Are you
           delusional? Do you even understand
           how ridiculous that makes you
           sound?
                         
          They are really going at it now. He tries to grab her purse,
          which she still has over her shoulder. They struggle for it.
                         
                          ABEL
           Where is this thing? Let me see it.

                          ABEL
           Let me see it. Is this going to
           make you safe?
                         
          With that he uses brute force, probably hurting her arm, but
          she doesn't let on. He takes the purse from her. He opens it
          and takes out the small gun.

           It's a trap... and you are walking

          There are twelve SEVEN-YEAR-OLDS sitting around the dining
          room table yelling "Happy Birthday" to one of the Morales
          daughters as she blows out the candles. A large GROUP of the
          PARENTS surround the table.

          Just as ELIZABETH blows out the candles the doorbell rings.
          NANNY MARIA heads to the front door. The camera stays with
          the party. NANNY MARIA comes back into the room and standing
          behind her, we see a POLICE OFFICER holding some kind of
          clipboard.
                         
          ABEL walks over quickly trying not to create a scene. He
          leads the POLICE OFFICER back over to the front door. The
          PARENTS certainly notice and start stirring.

          ABEL leads the OFFICER outside, and as he looks up he sees
          that his driveway is packed with four police cars, some
          unmarked and there are about five OFFICERS waiting to come
          into the house.

           party.

          ABEL is seething and can only manage a slight nod.
                         
          As they look across the driveway they see the OFFICER talking
          to someone. The officer shifts out of the way and they see he
          is talking to ASSISTANT D.A. LAWRENCE.

          He turns and they look at each other. She signals towards the
          library and they share a knowing, concerned glance.

          JULIAN is close to getting off the bridge and is starting to
          feel better. Just as the traffic in front of him starts to
          clear up, out of the corner of his eye he sees something.
          In his side-view mirror he sees LOUIS SERVIDIO getting out of
          a random car behind him. His heart starts racing. He looks
          over in the other mirror and there is THUG #2 walking up.
          Again.
                         
          JULIAN thinks for a second then reaches for the CB RADIO.
                         
                          JULIAN
           Cathy! They are coming again. Over.
           Help. Help. On Bridge.
                         
          He then fumbles the CB and it drops to the floor of the cab.
          He looks up into the mirrors again and sees that they are
          still coming for him.
                         
          The camera now comes in tight on his face and he pauses for a
          long second, and he then makes his decision. He reaches under
          his seat and takes out a handgun. He doesn't really seem to
          know what he is doing with it.
                         
          But he opens the door of the truck and gets out. He aims the
          gun at LOUIS SERVIDIO walking towards him. LOUIS SERVIDIO
          sees him and is very surprised and stops.
                         
                          LOUIS SERVIDIO

          People in the cars behind the truck are starting to honk.
          Then LOUIS SERVIDIO gives a nod signal to THUG #2 who is on
          the other side of the truck, and JULIAN'S gun fires by
          mistake. It totally misses THUG #2. He jumps out of the way
          and is hiding behind the wheel.
                         
           LOUIS SERVIDIO (CONT'D)
           Watch it now, man. You're going to
           hurt someone.
                         
          JULIAN is now in a total state of panic. He is hiding back in
          front of the truck. The three men are basically doing a slow-
          motion, very stressful hide-and-seek around the truck. The
          two THUGS now have their guns out.
                         
          The honking has now reached a total insane level as traffic
          is backing up.
          Then THUG #2 makes one last play to take the truck. He tries
          to climb into the cab and JULIAN goes into a rage. He quickly
          fires three shots, missing THUG #2 with each one, but that
          forces LOUIS SERVIDIO to shoot two shots of his own at JULIAN
          to protect THUG #2. They miss as well, but one hits the main
          section of the tank and a small but steady stream of heating
          oil starts pouring out onto the roadway.
                         
          Just then we hear sirens starting to come closer in the
          background. This adds a new element.

          THUG #2 takes off. This now leaves JULIAN and LOUIS SERVIDIO
          all alone with the police coming. As JULIAN is hiding, trying
          to figure out what to do next, LOUIS SERVIDIO goes running by
          him. As he does:

          JULIAN runs all along the bridge and then sees LOUIS SERVIDIO
          run through a small door into the body of one of the four
          massive stone anchor structures that hold up the bridge.

          Once he is inside, there's another set of stairs. He locks
          the door behind him and starts racing down the stairs. As he
          heads down he hears someone just in front of him.
          He stops and looks down the center column of the stairs and
          looking up at him about three flights away is LOUIS SERVIDIO.

          again as well. The camera stays right where it was as JULIAN
          heads down out of sight. We just hear the sounds of his feet
          getting lower and lower.
                         
                         
          INT. BRIDGE GROUND FLOOR - DAY
                         
          JULIAN comes to the first door and looks at it. We can hear
          sirens in the distance on the other side of the door. He
          keeps going.
                         
          Down two more flights, just as he said, there is another
          doorway. JULIAN walks up to that door very carefully. He
          listens on the other side but doesn't hear anything but his
          own breath.
                         
                         
          INT. STAIR LANDING LOWEST LEVEL - DAY
                         
          Then we hear the door back up top fly open. JULIAN then
          quietly opens the door in front of him and right in front of
          his face is a woman in full jogging clothes running by him.
          He looks around, and after a second to get himself
          orientated, we see he's on a riverfront esplanade where there
          are many people jogging and walking, enjoying the evening.
                          78
                         
                         
          JULIAN looks at his hand and realizes he is still holding the
          gun out in the open. He puts it away and then looks up at the
          bridge that is hovering above him.
                         
          He knows he left his life as he knew it up on that bridge.
                         
           FADE TO BLACK.
                         
          Over the black we begin to hear the rumble of a very large
          truck. It gets louder and louder.
                         
          INT. OF A VERY LARGE EMPTY DUMPSTER - DAY
                         
          We now see that SALES STUDENT ALEX is inside a massive, empty
          construction dumpster. And as he looks around, we realize it
          is on the back of a truck that is currently driving pretty
          fast. With each bump that the truck goes over the noise
          inside the dumpster is deafening. As the KID comes to his
          senses he tries to stand up. As he does, we see that the
          sides of the dumpster are at least eight feet tall and the
          interior is very slick without anything to grab or stand on.
          He is trapped.
                         
          Just then the truck goes over another huge bump and comes to
          a stop. It idles for a minute then begins backing up. It
          stops. A warning, beeping alarm is heard, and finally one end
          of the dumpster begins rising. As it gets higher and higher
          our KID tries to hold himself back, but he begins to slide
          towards the low end. As he does he sees that the end that he
          is heading towards is on a hinge and it is starting to swing
          open. Finally the thing is at such an angle that he can't
          hold on any longer and he slides towards the opening.
                         
          As he falls out he/we see that he's being dumped over the
          edge of a cliff of some sort. He falls probably 10-12 feet,
          into a pile of garbage. As he gathers himself and tries to
          stand, we see he is standing in a massive landfill. He looks
          around as the truck pulls away. He's left totally alone.
                         
                         
          INT. TENNIS COURT OF SUBURBAN MANSION - DAY
                         
          ABEL is led by a MAID into an indoor tennis court. The house
          is massive and designed like an English Country Estate.
                         
          As ABEL walks up we see PETER FORENTE on the court playing
          against an automatic tennis ball machine. He is in full
          tennis whites as he hammers the balls back at the machine.
                         
          ABEL approaches the court and watches for a beat.
                          79
                         
                         
                          PETER FORENTE
           It's a pretty cool machine, isn't
           it?
                         
          ABEL nods.
                         
           PETER FORENTE (CONT'D)
           I was paying a guy five bucks an
           hour to do this with me last year.
                          ABEL
           Peter.
                         
          This causes PETER to look up and see the serious look on
          ABEL's face. He hits one last shot and walks a little closer
          to ABEL. The machine is still hitting balls behind PETER.
                         
                          PETER FORENTE
           Yes.
                         
                          ABEL
           I need to speak with you.
                         
                          PETER FORENTE
           I see that.
          PETER walks over to the machine and unplugs it. He points
          over towards the chairs courtside. He and ABEL sit down.
                         
                          ABEL
           This has gotten out of control...
           There was a guy with a gun at my
           house.
                         
          ABEL lets this sit for a minute, and he is intently reading
          PETER's face. He hopes not, but he is judging to see if PETER
          had anything to do with all these attacks. PETER just looks
          back at him with a very strong poker face.
                         
                          ABEL (CONT'D)
           My wife and children were home at
           the time.

           Is everyone okay?
                         
                          ABEL
           Yes. I managed to chase him off.
                         
                          PETER FORENTE
           Well, I'm sorry, that must have
           been scary... what can I do.

                          ABEL
           It's one thing to come after my
           trucks and drivers... and to steal
           from me... but this... it's
           different.

           Have you met my father?
                         
          They both smile. His father is an old-school gangster.
                         
           PETER FORENTE (CONT'D)
           A bunch of thugs invaded our home
           when I was a baby... My mother was
           there with us... My brother
           remembers it. Nothing happened.
           They were trying to scare my
           father. They ended up just leaving
           and we never found out who it was.
           But after that we moved to a
           fortress just like this. And those
           guys who let you in. They are here
           to shoot anyone who isn't invited.

           for a meeting.

          and as he gets nearer to his car he starts to hear the mayhem
          that is coming from the CB radio in the front seat. As he
          gets closer he gets more and more details.

          The camera now comes around to the outside of the car looking
          back at ABEL through the windshield. The mansion is looming
          in the background. We see ABEL'S face react as he hears the
          news of the incident on the bridge. The camera pulls back as
          ABEL'S face goes totally cold.

          packing up his things at the front of the room. They catch
          each others eye. ABEL makes his way forward as everyone else

          He stops dead in his tracks and then carefully looks around

          empty.

          ABEL pulls up in his car and the gate starts to open. As it
          does we see ARTHUR LEWIS standing waiting next to his car.
          ABEL pulls in next to him and gets out. There is an
          overriding, almost unsettling calm to this conversation.

           You now have three separate serious
           pending legal cases against you.
           One with sixteen counts of
           misconduct ranging from fraud to
           tax evasion. And then in the middle
           of our meeting today I get a report
           saying you had armed your entire
           fleet of drivers which led to a
           shoot-out on the 59th Street

           It does matter, that you know we
           didn't do this.
                         
                          ARTHUR LEWIS
           I do... I do. But it doesn't

          The banker gets into his car and backs out. The gate opens
          and he drives out. Just as it is about to close it starts
          opening again. SALES STUDENT ALEX drives in with his car
          trashed. He pulls up and gets out of the car looking at ABEL.
          He knows what has happened and is crushed. Neither of them
          say a word, finally ABEL gives the kid a cautious but
          meaningful hug around the shoulder and leads him inside.

          dining table smoking a cigarette inside. She has been crying.

           No... I'm not... They're out.
                         
          This gets her attention.

           The bank.
                         
          With that ABEL walks out of the room and heads up the stairs
          to his bedroom. When he's halfway up the stairs she stops
          him.

                          ABEL
           It means we need to find the money
           somewhere else.

          ABEL is driving ANNA'S car towards the city. ANNA is in the
          passenger seat and the three DAUGHTERS are in the back. ANNA
          and ABEL do not look any better. In fact there is now a tinge
          of anger mixed into the sadness.
                         
          The DAUGHTERS are arguing about who's taking up too much room
          in the back seat.

          ANNA turns and snaps at them a bit.
                          ANNA
           Stop. I've told you guys not to
           push it this morning, this is not
           the morning to be doing this... but
           since the second you all woke up.
           It's this, it's that. Just stop.
           The world does not revolve around
           you!
          This shuts them up for a beat. ABEL is seething. But then
          ELIZABETH (middle) nudges ANNIE (oldest) so she gives
          CATHERINE (youngest) a good hit. ANNA sees it and freaks.

          Before ANNA can get the full sentence out ABEL suddenly pulls
          the car off the side of the highway into the grass. Everyone
          in the car is taken aback. The road is a smaller scenic
          highway not some eight lane affair but this whole sequence
          still plays out with the menacing roar of the cars going by
          right next to them.
                         
          EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
                         
          ABEL gets out of the car and slams the door. He walks around
          the back of the car as the cars fly by them on the highway.
          He goes around to his oldest daughter's door and pulls ANNIE
          from the car. They stand behind the car and go at it with the
          traffic flying by. ABEL is louder than he has been in the
          entire film. He is losing it from all the pressure but his
          daughter bears the brunt.
                         
                          ABEL
           You are thirteen years old. What

           an hour ago to help her get out of

           about?
                         
          ABEL is looking around for someone to help him and witness
          this. He then switches, he has had enough and gets right up
          in her face.

           I'm not sure who the hell you think

           that way... You are in serious
           danger of becoming a rich little
           spoiled brat and I can tell you
           from experience there is nothing
           worse in the world than a rich
           little girl who thinks the whole
           world revolves around her.
          ANNIE is yelling back over the traffic.

           What about her? And what about you?
           You're both so totally obsessed
           with your stupid business. You
           walk around like you are saving the
           world but what are you doing...
           nothing!
                         
          This stings. He now changes his tone to a quiet low roar. But
          he can't keep quiet and by the end of the line he is yelling
          again.
                          ABEL
           First off I don't walk around like
           I am saving anything. I chose this
           business because I looked at the
           world and said `What's the last
           bill people stop paying every month
           when they are low on cash?' `Cause
           that's a business I want to be in.
           `Cause failure wasn't much of an
           option for me. I lived in
           reality... not whatever this world
           is you are living in. And we help
           people stay warm... which isn't all
           that bad.

           Maybe you've got grander ambitions
           but for now this is how you eat,
           sleep, and get all dressed up... So
           you better shape the fuck up and

          crunching numbers. Finally ABEL walks into the doorway, he
          looks exhausted.

           That was a good year.
                         
          ANNA gives a slight look that the numbers may not totally
          support that claim.

           I'm not sure yet... but it's not as
           bad as they are saying it is...
           Turns out I kinda knew what I was
           doing.
                         
          They give each other a slight smile.

           I got us a three more days... and
           one piece... from Saul. But we're
           still about a million short.

          He pauses just long enough to think.
                         
                          ABEL
           Of course.
                         
          A sense of caring and resolve comes over them. At least now
          they know what needs to be done.

           I love you too.
                         
          ABEL turns to go upstairs as ANNA starts in again with the

          ANDREW stands in the hallway about to knock, but he waits for
          a beat. He knocks.
                         
          The door opens to a young woman, presumably JULIAN'S wife,
          LUISA.

           No.
                          ANDREW WALSH

                          LUISA
           I will tell him.
          JULIAN steps into the frame from behind her.
                         
                         
          EXT./INT. LARGE LATE-MODEL AMERICAN CAR, PARKED - DAY
                         
          A DRIVER is sitting in the driver's seat. ANDREW walks up and
          gets in the front seat. JULIAN gets into the back and looks
          over at ABEL who is sitting next to him. They drive off and
          nobody says a word for a very, very long time.
                         
                         
          EXT. EMPTY PARKING LOT - DAY
                         
          The car finally pulls into a large empty parking lot. For a
          couple beats JULIAN has a look on his face that he may be
          getting rubbed out.
          Then off in the distance we see two cop cars. The car pulls
          up to them and stops. ABEL and the DRIVER get out of the car
          without a word, but ANDREW stays and turns around and now
          gives him a total debrief.
                         
                          JULIAN
           He's turning me in?
                         
          ANDREW looks at him without much remorse.
                         
                          ANDREW WALSH
           Of course we are turning you in.
           You have put everything that man
           has worked for for the last 20
           years at risk. If it was up to me
           we would be dealing with this in a
           very different way.

           But I know things...
                         
          This causes ANDREW to turn quickly back to him with as sharp
          a look as he has.

          JULIAN looks back at him.
                         
           ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D)
           I strongly suggest you think that
           through before you answer it.
           Because even if you did, what does
           it do for you? Nothing. There is
           nothing there for you to gain.
           Nothing.

           Good. Your background check with us

                          ANDREW WALSH
           Because no bank will touch us right
           now. So we can't close on the new
           property. And he's going to lose
           everything on his deposit.
                         
          This sits heavily on JULIAN. ANDREW hands him a card.

          The three COPS are standing waiting as JULIAN walks towards
          them. ABEL turns around, facing the camera, and closes his
          eyes in sadness.
                         
          With ABEL in the foreground we see JULIAN make it halfway to
          the COPS, then he stops.
                         
                          COP 1

          JULIAN sets off running. Before the COPS can get close to him
          he is off. ABEL turns and sees what is happening. He does not
          follow chase. His head just drops.

          We are now with JULIAN again, running. But as this chase
          continues we see his face turn from fear, to desperation, to
          a creeping sense of evil. He does not know how it has come to
          this, but as he jumps down from fences and runs across
          deserted lots we see that his weakness is turning.
                         
          As he runs through some of the most bombed-out, destroyed
          sections of Queens, he just never stops. With each step his
          fear turns to... anger.

          He stops, collapses, and hides behind a blown-out building
          wall just as a COP CAR drives by. He starts to almost cry,
          but then it again becomes something else. His survival
          instinct is taking over and we are not sure what will become
          of it. Anger.

           I know our agreement doesn't allow
           for that. But... I need more time.

           Why?

           I'll give you three more days. Then

          ANDREW sits across from LAWRENCE and DEPUTY LANGE. They wait
          while LAWRENCE writes something down on a pad in front of
          him. He finishes.
                         
           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
           So. I should start by thanking you
           for your assistance in... in
           attempting to bring in your driver?
                          ANDREW WALSH
           We didn't think he'd react that
           way.
                         
           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
           Yes... Well, the officers there
           didn't set it up very well on their
           end either.
                         
                          ANDREW WALSH
           I'm sorry.
                         
           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
           We are looking for him.
                         
                          ANDREW WALSH
           So are we... it's very sad. He was
           very close to Abel.
                         
           A.D.A. LAWRENCE

           It has been brought to our
           attention that it might be
           beneficial on your end to resolve
           this issue in a time sensitive way.

           Possibly.
                          DEPUTY LANGE
           So we have prepared an offer for
           you to review.
                         
          They slide the offer across the table. ANDREW opens it and
          gives it a once over.
                          ANDREW WALSH
           I'll show this to them. He'll never
           go for it, but it's a start.
                         
           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
           This could get a lot worse for you

           I know... I will present it to him.
                         
          ANDREW gets up and prepares to leave. LAWRENCE stands with
          him and walks him out into the hallway.
                         
           ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D)
           Thank you.

           And Andrew, one other thing.
                         
          He turns. They are now alone in the hallway.

           This fucking bullshit with the open

           Not for you... but for me.

           I need the driver.
                          ANDREW WALSH
           I understand. The kid went out and
           got his own gun. This was not us.
           No matter what you think of him,
           Abel doesn't work this way.
                         
           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
           I really could give a fuck, but you
           need to get your man to talk to
           these people, give in, stop doing
           whatever you are doing to bring
           this shit on you. It needs to stop.
                         
                          ANDREW WALSH
           He wants to talk to them. We've
           been trying to set up a meeting.
           O'Leary hasn't been able to get it
           done.
                         
           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
           I'll talk to him.
                         
          ANDREW gives him a look.
           A.D.A. LAWRENCE (CONT'D)
           He's an old friend... and get that
           kid back in here. I'm up in it a
           little bit here and I need
           something.
                         
          LAWRENCE turns and walks back into his office. ANDREW walks
          down the hallway all alone then stops. He reaches into his
          briefcase and takes out the offer. He looks it over again.
          Then he looks towards the ground and almost looks like he
          might cry. There is a distinct sense of responsibility for
          the situation that ABEL finds himself in that is starting to
          bring ANDREW to the edge.

          driving into the lot next to him and gets out.
                         
                          ABEL
           I talked to the Hasid, I got us
           three days.

           Well here it is. It's just a first
           pass.
          He hands him the plea deal from the DA. ABEL looks it over
          but shows almost no emotion. Then.

                          ANDREW WALSH
           I know. It's just a first offer.
                          ABEL

           I know. It makes me very sad,
           because he is a very talented young
           man. But there are some decisions
           that you cannot come back from. I
           need to know where he is. And I
           need him to turn himself in. His
           actions are hurting me and my
           business. And I refuse to let other
           people's weaknesses hurt me. I
           don't know how it has come to this,
           but it has. If he does the right

          He starts flying down the stairs at top panic speed. ABEL

          crunching numbers. Finally ABEL walks into the doorway, he
          looks exhausted.

           Hi.
                         
                          ABEL
           How's it coming?
                         
                          ANNA
           I've made it to 1975.
                         
                          ABEL
           That was a good year.
          ANNA gives a slight look that the numbers may not totally
          support that claim.
                         
                          ABEL (CONT'D)
           Well it was for me...how is it?
                         
                          ANNA
           I'm not sure yet... but it's not as
           bad as they are saying it is... I
           guess I knew what I was doing.
                         
          They give each other a slight smile.
                         
                          ANNA (CONT'D)

           I got us a three more days... and
           one piece... from Saul. But we're
           still about a million short.
                         
          Concern and exhaustion creep onto Abel's face.
                         
                          ANNA
           You're going to see your little

           Probably.
                         
          Abel is now sitting down on the chair.

           How are the girls? I feel like I
           haven't seen them in days.

           They're fine.
                         
          ANNA gets up from her desk and comes over to him.
                         
                          ANNA (CONT'D)
           This is all worth it.
                         
          He pauses just long enough to think.
                         
                          ABEL

           I know.
                         
          A sense of caring and resolve comes over them. At least now
          they know what needs to be done.
                         
                          ABEL (CONT'D)
           We should get to bed.

          ABEL turns to go upstairs as ANNA starts in again with the
          machine.

          INT. ABEL'S CAR - DRIVING - DAY
          ABEL is driving towards the office and is listening to the
          idle chatter on the radio between the dispatcher and the
          drivers who are out. They are underneath the Brooklyn Queens
          Expressway in stop and go traffic.
                         
          Suddenly a panic stricken VOICE blasts through on the radio.
                         
           SENIOR DRIVER EDDY V.O.
           Motherfuckers!
                         
           RADIO DISPATCHER V.O.

           SENIOR DRIVER EDDY V.O.
           It's 17. Two guys are coming at me.
                         
           RADIO DISPATCHER V.O.
           Where are you?
                         
          We now hear the driver yell at the TWO GUYS coming at him.
                         
           SENIOR DRIVER EDDY V.O.
           Fuck you!

           Hall Street and Flushing Ave. I'm

           RADIO DISPATCHER V.O.
           Eddy? Eddy?
                         
          ABEL looks up at the street where they are and realizes this
          is going down right down the street from them. He's had
          enough.
                         
          He pulls across the intersection and heads down a street. He
          comes to the next intersection and right in front of him the
          truck comes flying by.
                         
          He looks to his right and sees EDDY standing at the side of
          the road. But he wants to end this. So he pulls out and
          starts following the truck leaving EDDY behind.
                         
          ABEL follows the truck for several blocks through the
          industrial neighborhood. He is tempted to pull up alongside
          of it to see who is driving but doesn't. He continues to
          follow him.
                          112
                         
                         
          They get to a light and the truck makes a right hand turn
          and, as they are turning, LOUIS SERVIDIO who is sitting in
          the passenger seat looks behind him and sees that ABEL is
          following him. It now turns into a high speed chase as the
          driver steps on it.
                         
          They race down a ramp into a railyard. ABEL chases the truck
          as it crosses the tracks and heads towards an abandoned
          tunnel. The truck races into the tunnel and ABEL follows. The
          truck is throwing up a dust storm and ABEL has a difficult
          time seeing where he is going but he keeps up.
                         
          The roadway is very bumpy and both the truck and ABEL'S car
          are thrown around and the truck almost hits the sides of the
          tunnel.
                         
          The light at the end of the tunnel starts to appear through
          the dust but we can't see the truck. As ABEL comes into the
          light he has to SLAM on his brakes because the TRUCK has
          flipped over in front of him.
                         
          As he gets out of his car he sees LOUIS SERVIDIO jumping down
          from the overturned cab and run off into the train yard. ABEL
          looks at the crushed cab of the truck and sees the DRIVER has
          been killed. There is a gun sitting on the dash of the truck
          and ABEL looks and thinks. He then picks up the gun and
          chases after LOUIS SERVIDIO.
                         
          In the distance he sees LOUIS SERVIDIO leave the yard and
          head up into an elevated subway station.
                         
                         
          EXT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY
                         
          ABEL runs up the stairs of the station and hops onto a
          leaving train just as the doors shut. ABEL looks around.
          There are three people in his car. It is covered in graffiti.
          He starts making his way down to the end of the train where
          the guy is.
                         
          He looks into the last car and sees LOUIS SERVIDIO and just
          bull rushes him to the ground. He starts beating on him very,
          very badly with the pistol. All the rage comes out of him. He
          then aims the gun at LOUIS SERVIDIO.
                         
                          LOUIS SERVIDIO
           Please. Please.
                         
          They stare at each other.
                         
                          ABEL
           Your friend is dead... who do you
           work for.
                          113
                         
                         
                          LOUIS SERVIDIO
           You know I could never tell you
           that.
                         
                          ABEL
           Stop... just stop.
                         
                          LOUIS SERVIDIO
           This was it anyway. Okay... Okay.
          ABEL looks right through him and then finally lowers the gun
          and releases his hands from around his jacket and he gets up
          and looks back at ABEL.
                         
           LOUIS SERVIDIO (CONT'D)
           Thank you.
                         
          LOUIS SERVIDIO then runs out of the car as the door opens.
          ABEL sits up and slows his breathing down. Finally he looks
          around the trashed car and sees that a woman has been in the
          car with them the whole time and she is just staring at him.

          ABEL walks into the shop and is a little put back together
          but is worse for the wear. ARNOLD KLINE is sitting in one of
          the chairs waiting. He turns to ABEL.

          Jimmy looks around then walks into the back.
                         
                          ARNOLD KLINE

                          ARNOLD KLINE
           I had nothing to do with that.

           I was standing on top of one of my
           hi-jacked trucks a couple weeks ago
           thinking about the cowards who did
           this when I remembered I had bought
           the load of fuel off a friend's
           tanker straight from Texas. As I'm
           sure you know Texas #4 is marked.
           But that was just one load, so
           every truck that has left my lot
           for the last two weeks has been
           marked with dye that I've put in...
           And luckily four more of my trucks
           got jacked since.... My guess is
           there are at least 4600 gallons of
           marked fuel in your small tank
           right now.

           When you find out who else it was
           you can get them to pay you back
           the difference. Kinda makes you
           miss having your father around? But
           I need the whole lot tomorrow or

          ABEL is sitting on a bleacher totally alone watching a prep
          school football practice. We stay with him as he sits quietly
          just watching.
                         
          Eventually his 21-YEAR-OLD YOUNGER BROTHER, ELIAS, comes
          walking off the field over to him. PLAYERS start leaving the
          field.

          We aren't sure what he is there for. On the other side of the

           do, probably better than us, and I
           accept that. But this would be
           different. I don't want you to be

           Since 1971 I have been skimming
           money out of the company. Some
           years a little... others a lot. In
           the beginning it was just in case
           times got tough but then it was
           because you were taking all these
           chances... I didn't know what else
           to do... I couldn't risk having us
           be left with nothing.

           Well it sounds like you should take
           this money and keep it right where
           it is... because I'm going to
           pretend that we never had this
           conversation. And you can use that
           when they drag me off to jail!
          With that he tries to get passed her and head upstairs. She
          follows and is standing looking up at him.

          ABEL turns and looks back at him.
                          ABEL
           We call the police.
                         
                          ANDREW WALSH
           Really?
                         
                          ABEL
           Yes!
          With that he walks off behind the tanks.
                         
                         
          EXT. PARKING LOT, NEXT TO THE TANK FARM SITE - DAY
                         
          There are now POLICE VEHICLES everywhere. ABEL is standing
          off alone. The DA gets out of a car all alone and walks over
          to ABEL.
                         
           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
           I'm very sorry. Did you know him
           well?
                         
                          ABEL
           I did.
           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
           He must have been under a hell of a
           lot of pressure.
                         
                          ABEL
           Yeah. For a while I thought he
           was... it's just...
                         
           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
           I'm sorry.
                         
          They look out across the city.
                         
                          ABEL
           You really do have to be lucky.
                         
           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
           Yes... so you are chasing down
           hijackers now?
                         
                          ABEL
           I was right there... I couldn't
           help myself.
                         
          LAWRENCE nods approval.
                          129
                         
                         
                          ABEL (CONT'D)
           Have you found the driver?
           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
           No.
                         
                          ABEL
           You'll find him.
                         
           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
           Probably not.
                         
                          ABEL
           Well, thank you for coming. I
           wanted to make sure this was
           handled correctly.
                         
           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
           Of course.
                         
                          ABEL
           I'm not sure how I got here.
                         
           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
           Yeah.
                          ABEL
           So... I should tell you that I
           won't be able to take that deal you
           offered. There is no way I would
           ever accept a felony charge for
           anything we've done.
                         
           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
           I know.
                         
                          ABEL
           I am not a felon.
                         
           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
           That's probably true.
                         
                          ABEL
           But I also can't have you digging
           around my life and keeping this
           hanging around my neck for the next
           ten years. I love fighting a good
           battle but this... it's very bad
           for my business.
                         
          This gets Lawrence's attention.
                          130
                         
                         
                          ABEL (CONT'D)
           So, we need to come to some sort of
           conclusion.
                         
           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
           We can probably do that.
                         
                          ABEL
           Good.
          They both look out for a beat.
                         
           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
           I hear you closed on this terminal
           today?
                         
                          ABEL
           It looks that way.
                         
           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
           I didn't realize that you had that
           in the works.
                         
                          ABEL
           For a very long time.
           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
           That will put you in quite a
           powerful position.
                         
                          ABEL
           Within my business it has that
           potential.
                         
          LAWRENCE shifts his tone ever so slightly.
                         
           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
           If you get this place up and
           running again it will have
           significant influence...
           politically speaking.
                         
          ABEL picks up on the word POLITICALLY and stares down
          LAWRENCE.
                         
           A.D.A. LAWRENCE (CONT'D)
           We all have our ambitions.
                         
                          ABEL
           Yes.
                         
          LAWRENCE gives a slight smile and then pauses.
                          131
                         
                         
           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
           And sometimes we need help to get
           there... You've come a very long
           way.
                         
                          ABEL
           Yes, I have.
                         
           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
           In a very short time.
                          ABEL
           It doesn't feel that way... But
           please know that I have always
           chosen the path that was the most
           right.
                         
           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
           The most right?
                         
                          ABEL
           Yes.
                         
           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
           That one makes my head hurt a
           little.
                          ABEL
           The result is never in question for
           me. Just what path do I take to get
           there. And I have never questioned
           my path. There is always one that
           is most right. And that is what
           this is.
                         
           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
           I hope so.
                         
          They look at each other and then out over the city.
                         
                         
                         
                          THE END
