          They take off, running for the slim cave mouth. Their lights
          dancing in the darkness as they scramble for the exit --
          leading onto the beach. The narrow gap allows just one
          person at a time. And at a push. Lisa edges through first.

          Lisa kicks back at him, but he keeps pushing. She tumbles
          onto the seaweed strewn sands, drenched by the incoming tide,
          as O'Shea squeezes through next. Soon, wedged in himself.

          The Grabber rushes towards O'Shea, gaining speed.    Almost on

          BAM! The Grabber fills the gap in the rock face, trapped by
          its own bulk. It snarls as one of its tentacles slithers out

          Paddy regards the egg then takes off after O'Shea and Lisa.
          And in the gouged out sand beneath their feet more exposed
          EGGS flutter with life. These things are close to hatching.

          Once they do, every surface drips. A fish-tank overflows.
                         
          They rise slowly from the slick floor. It's eerily quiet.
          Smith picks up a stool. Lisa grabs a scalpel. O'Shea rolls

          O'Shea flails and smashes into lab units, knocking a utility

          surrounding him and jabs at the Grabber with the handle.

          KABOOOOOM!
                         
          The shockwave hurtles Lisa onto her arse beside O'Shea.    Both
          laid out in the mud. Grabber gunk and rain pelts them.
                         
                                                O'SHEA
                       Jesus, you're dangerous.

          They laugh.
                         
          EXT. GRASSY HILL OVERLOOKING BEACH - DAWN
                         
          No longer raining, O'Shea and Lisa look absolutely filthy as
          they come walking over the hillside. She hiccups demurely.
                         
                                                LISA
                       You look like crap.

                       So do you.
                         
          They shuffle on together. Battle-scarred. Limping.   Side-by-
          side. Lisa takes O'Shea's flask from her pocket.
                         
                                                   LISA
                       Here.
                         
          She hands it to him. O'Shea remembers it for a brief moment,
          then lets it fall away. Lisa smiles. Proud of him.
                         
          They stagger on, the beautiful sea panorama before them.
          Casually they fill the pauses, at ease with the world.
                         
                                                LISA
                       I think I'll take some time-off.

                       You know if you lived here you'd be
                       home already.
                         
          Lisa absorbs the vista before her.

                    I'll need all the help I can get.
                         
          O'Shea puts his arm around her, and they seem right together.
                         
                                             LISA

                    First, lets get out of these wet

                    Sounds good.
                         
          They laugh, and stumble on arm-in-arm into the sunrise.
                         
          EXT. SHORE - DAWN
                         
          In the ripples of sand, a different pattern is obvious, some
          unusual tracks lead to water... Jumpers. They made it.
