    FADE IN:

1   EXT. MIAMI LANDSCAPE - NIGHT                                   1
    The sun might be down, but the city is baking. Waves of
    heat ascend into the sky while an unmarked van navigates
    ACROSS the SCREEN.

2   INT. UNMARKED VAN - IN MOTION - NIGHT                          2
    The driver is EDDIE DOMINGUEZ. And riding in the passen-
    ger seat is a man dressed in black, called FOUCHET. He
    looks to the rear.
                             FOUCHET
               What's taking so long back there?
                                                  CUT TO:

    REAR
    Where the rest of the gang waits.      NOAH, KUNI, FERGUSON,
    and CASPER. All dressed in black      like Fouchet, except
    for ANDY. He stands and shows off      his Miami PD uniform.
    His English is poor, yet he's got     a big, happy-to-be-
    along grin on his face.
                             ANDY
               How do I look? Like the real
               thing, yeah?
                             FOUCHET
               Step back and lemme get a good
               look at you.


    CLOSE SHOT - REAR VIEW MIRROR
    THROUGH which Eddie can watch the action. Andy steps
    further to the rear, almost to the door, facing the
    front.
                             FOUCHET
               Tell me again about your
               assignment, Andrew?
                             ANDY
               I'm the decoy.
                             FOUCHET
               Right you are.
    Over the seat Fouchet reveals a SHOTGUN.     BOOM!

                                                              2.
3    EXT. VAN IN MOTION                                            3
     Andy's body is blown through the rear doors as the van
     turns a corner.

4    INT. VAN - FOUCHET                                            4
     He dials 911 on his cellular phone.     Fouchet sounds
     distressed.
                            FOUCHET
              Please help! I just saw a
              policeman shot! Send help.
              Hurry! I'm at the corner of...


5    EXT. NEAR DOWNTOWN - VAN - NIGHT                              5
     A stream of PD CARS haul past, lights blazing and SIRENS
     on full.

6    EXT. COLONY HOTEL (SOUTH BEACH) - NIGHT                       6
     Crowds moving up and down Ocean Blvd. Beautiful people
     walking. Beautiful people watching. MUSIC BLENDS from
     nightclub to nightclub. A POLICE RADIO, holstered to the
     hip of a street cop. It CRACKLES with:
                            POLICE RADIO (V.O.)
              Report of an officer down. Be
              advised, all units. Corner of
              Lennox and Taylor.
     Slipping by the street cop: Intro MARCUS BURNETT and
     MIKE LOWREY. They shimmy through the hotel doors.


A7   INT. COLONY HOTEL - NIGHT                                     A7
     Where the buffed DESK MANAGER gets off the phone to
     greet the effeminate pair.
                              LOWREY
              Good evening.    I'm Mike --
                            BURNETT
              -- And I'm Marcus.
                            LOWREY
              We're lookin' for a couple of our
              Latin friends who checked in a
              little while ago. You might
              remember them?
                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                           3.
A7   CONTINUED:                                                  A7
                            BURNETT
              No chest hair. And packin'.
                             DESK MANAGER
              I'm sorry.   But our guest list is
              private.
                            LOWREY
              Oh, didn't they say? There's
              going to be party! It's
              B.Y.O.B.O. --
                     (leans in close)
              The B.O. stands for baby oil.
                            BURNETT
              Maybe you can come. Get off after
              you get off?
     All three of them laugh.
                            DESK MANAGER
              Well, now that you mention it.
              They were kinda cute. Suite 202.

7    INT. COLONY HOTEL - STAIRWELL - NIGHT                       7
     Lowrey and Burnett clip on their shields and unholster
     their guns. The posing is over. This is business.

A8   INT. COLONY HOTEL - SUITE 202 - NIGHT                       A8
     On the table are two briefcases. Each opened. One
     containing cocaine. The other, cash. A pistol next
     to each.

     REVEAL the dealers. Two young Dominicans seated across
     from the TV, getting high, drinking beer and laughing out
     loud at the Spanish language version of Time Traxx.
     Then --
     BANG! The door's kicked in and Lowrey's first through.
     Burnett on backup.
                             LOWREY
              Police!   On the floor!
     But the dealers split, rolling out of their chairs.   One
     goes left and the other, right.
                                               CUT TO:

                                                           4.
B8   BEDROOM                                                      B8
     Lowrey tackles the first dealer to the floor. A LATINA
     girl screams. Lowrey unfortunately looks and takes a
     hard fist across the ear from the dealer. Angered,
     Lowrey swings his pistol up underneath the perp's jaw
     and knocks him through the bathroom door. Lowrey cuffs
     him to the sink. Meanwhile... Back to:

8    LIVING ROOM                                                  8
     Burnett's in trouble. He's still got his gun in hand.
     But the other dealer has him pinned underneath the legs
     of a chair.
                              BURNETT
                Lowrey!
     Burnett stomps the bad guy's instep. The guy buckles.
     Burnett rolls away and stands in front of a window, just
     in time to see the angry Dominican heading straight for
     him.

A9   EXT. COLONY HOTEL - CONTINUOUS ACTION                        A9
     Burnett   and the other dealer come crashing out onto the
     balcony,   then over onto an awning, rolling off onto some
     occupied   cafe tables. Patrons scatter. Uniformed cops
     move in   to assist.

9    LOWREY                                                       9
     appears soon after, walking down the hotel steps, leading
     the Latina in his cuffs, and wearing his jacket.

                              BURNETT
                       (scraped, bruised,
                        pissed)
                Nice backup.
                              LOWREY
                What?
     We TILT UP as POLICE HELICOPTER flies overhead.

10   EXT. MIAMI BEACH SKYLINE - TITLE SEQUENCE - NIGHT            10
     As OPENING TITLES RUN and MUSIC POUNDS -- we FLY OVER the
     causeways, waterways and hotels that line the beach.
     Something is happening in the balmy city as we CRUISE
     downtown and ZERO IN ON...

                                                          5.
11   EXT. MIAMI'S OLDEST POLICE STATION (DOWNTOWN) - NIGHT       11
     The HELICOPTER ROARS low over the rooftops toward the
     causeway bridge.

12   EXT. POLICE STATION - ROOFTOP - FOUCHET - NIGHT             12
     As the helicopter passes over, he appears  from behind a
     large exhaust port. Casper, Ferguson, and   Noah behind
     him, all wearing high-tech miner's helmets  with built-in
     radio headsets, and an array of high-tech  tools.
                              FOUCHET
              It's time.
     The team crosses the roof to a huge air conditioning
     unit. They climb inside, carrying a six-foot-long metal
     case and what looks like a black scuba tank.

13   INT. AIR UNIT/SHAFTS                                        13
     Though it's windy and cramped in here, at least it's
     cool. From a prone position, Fouchet puts on his night
     vision goggles and reveals a palm top computer. Quickly
     he scrolls through the labyrinthine schematics loaded
     onto the unit. TILT DOWN to see the various ducts.
     Endless. Bottomless. But clearly, Fouchet's a man who
     knows his way.

14   INT. POLICE STATION - SERIES OF SHOTS - NIGHT               14
     Seemingly empty.   From squad rooms to locker rooms to
     booking.


15   INT. EVIDENCE ROOM - GUARD STATION                          15
     OFFICER BILL O'FEE, 50s, reads a magazine and drinks
     coffee. Video monitors in front of him show the
     different lockers inside the evidence room. We see one
     room with stacks upon stacks of heroin.

16   IN AIR UNIT                                                 16
     The team, attached to cables, slide into the building's
     guts and disappear. STATIC CRACKLES:
                               FOUCHET
              We're in.     Start the video.

                                                              6.
17   EXT. POLICE STATION - ALLEY - NIGHT                           17
     Kuni finds the conduit he's looking for, splices it,
     cuts into it with a Makita battery-powered circular saw,
     then attaches a handheld high-8 video machine and starts
     the video feed. The unit is strapped to the conduit.

18   INT. GUARD STATION - NIGHT                                    18
     The MONITORS FLUTTER, then STABILIZE.    Turning the page,
     O'Fee sugars his coffee.

19   INT. TRASH CHUTE ROOM - NIGHT                                 19
     An air vent smashes to the floor.    Two guys pull the
     metal case inside the room.

20   INT. EVIDENCE ROOM - HEROIN LOCKER - NIGHT                    20
     BANG! Another air conditioning vent grate crashes to
     the floor. Their headlights blazing, two men clamber
     into the cavernous room, Fouchet along with Casper. This
     is the special Drug Holding Room: The lock cuts like
     butter and the steel door is yanked open. One hundred
     million dollars in heroin. Each kilo brick is stamped
     with a distinctive octopus logo.
                            FOUCHET
                     (into mic)
              Where's Deputy Dog?
                            FERGUSON (V.O.)
                     (over radio mic)
              He made us.

                            FOUCHET
              Then do him, now!

21   GUARD STATION                                                 21
     Sure enough.    As O'Fee stands from his desk --
                                                  CUT TO:

22   VENT ABOVE                                                    22
     Where Ferguson is waiting with an air-powered tranquil-
     izer gun. He cuts loose a silent round that strikes
     O'Fee at the base of the neck. O'Fee stops. But before
     he can think to reach back at what hit him, his knees
     buckle and he drops to the linoleum. Out cold.

                                                            7.
23   INT. POLICE STATION - QUICK SHOTS - FERGUSON - NIGHT        23
     One by one he moves backwards through the various levels
     of locks, torching each to look as if they'd entered the
     evidence room from inside the PD station.
     Meanwhile --

24   TRACH CHUTE ROOM                                            24
     Noah removes what looks like a flattened bobsled with
     large urethane wheels from the metal case and places it
     inside the air shaft.
     Ferguson attaches the black "scuba tank," labeled
     "NITROUS OXIDE," to a valve. This is connected to a
     metal-cased cable system that is piston-gunned into the
     floor.
                                               CUT BACK TO:

25   HEROIN LOCKER                                               25
     Fouchet and Casper moving the stacks of heroin, placing
     them in the air duct on the bobsled. Once they're done,
     we hear RADIO GARBLE, then the sled is cabled to the con-
     traption. A button is pushed -- and the sled is pulled
     at breakneck speed through the duct.

26   EXT. POLICE STATION ALLEY - NIGHT                           26
     Bag after bag drops down the trash chute and tumbles into
     an open-roofed van where the last of the gang, Eddie
     Dominguez, waits with the ENGINE RUNNING.


27   IN AIR DUCT                                                 27
     The sled rockets by again -- WHOOSH -- loaded with more
     bags.

28   INT. HEROIN LOCKER                                          28
     Casper and Fouchet throw the last of their gear down the
     chute and ride the sled out.

29   EXT./INT. VAN - POLICE STATION - ALLEY                      29
     One! Two! Three! Four! They all land atop the bags.
     Eddie GUNS the VAN, which rolls up the ramp and out the
     garage.

     On the ledge the tape runs out and RECORDER EXPLODES.
     Pieces scatter.

31   EXT. STREET - NIGHT                                         31
     The van drives off into the golden sunrise of Miami.
     TITLES END.


32   EXT. LUXURY HIGH-RISE (COCONUT GROVE) - MORNING             32
     One of those expensive condo buildings on Brickell Avenue
     with a circular driveway and a uniformed doorman.

     CAMERA TRACKS THROUGH expensive and trendy bachelor's
     lair. State-of-the-art everything, gorgeous artwork.
     Spectacular view.
     CAMERA STALLS ON -- a perma-plaqued newspaper clipping
     with a photo depiction of Lowrey and Burnett in front of
     a giant pile of black heroin, thumbs up to the camera.
     The headline reads: MIAMI PD RECORDS RECORD HEROIN BUST.

34   INT. LOWREY'S BEDROOM - MORNING                             34

     Where Lowrey wakes up in a king-sized bed. The pain on
     his face and empty, scattered bottles tell us he's
     nursing a world-class hangover. He sits up, carefully,
     holds his aching head. Hearing BREATHING, Lowrey lifts
     the sheet next to him.

     REVEAL THE LATINA
     The one from the Colony Hotel. He drops the sheet back
     over her head, reaches over to his nightstand and grabs
     an industrial-sized bottle of Excedrin. Empty. He opens
     the nightstand drawer, extracts another bottle. Empty.

     All marble and brass. Lowrey opens up his medicine
     cabinet. Locating a new bottle of aspirin... he suddenly
     realizes that the SHOWER is RUNNING. Confused, he pulls
     open the shower curtain slightly. From the back, it's an
     incredible body, then she turns around and it's --
     THE LATINA
     Yes.   The very same as the one he just saw in bed.    What?
                               LATINA TWIN
               'Morning.
     Lowrey closes the curtain on her. Frowns at this
     impossibility. He steps back into the doorway and peers
     over at his bed. Yep, same face. Twins?
                             LOWREY
                      (shaking his head)
               Oh man...
     He tears open the bottle of aspirin.    Chug-a-lugs.

36   INT. BURNETT HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING                      36
     Burnett and his young wife, THERESA, are jarred awake by
     the CLOCK RADIO BLARING on the night stand. Theresa
     gropes for RADIO, shuts it OFF. Burnett playfully gropes
     for her.
                             THERESA
               Marcus, what are you doing?
                             BURNETT
               We're always saying we should
               spend more quality time together.
               Well, I got the time... and you
               got the quality...
     She laughs.   He kisses her.
                             BURNETT
               I can remember when we used to
               do it every morning.
                             THERESA
               That was how we got a three
               bedroom house filled with little
               Burnetts.
     She crawls from bed.
                             BURNETT
               Been over a week since I've had
               some quality time!

37   INT. BURNETT'S KITCHEN - MORNING                          37
     Pandemonium. There's the two-and-a-half-year-old,
     MEGAN, who's taking bites of food and spitting it back
     out, looking at it, then putting it back in. Six-year-
     old JILL, who is playing refrigerator magnet games on the
     fridge. And Marcus in the middle of it all, deftly side-
     stepping his eight-year-old boy, QUINCY, who appears on
     roller blades whizzing through with a hockey stick and
     ball. He body-checks Jill against the ice box.
                            JILL
              Mom, Quincy pushed me.
                            QUINCY
              Uncle Mike showed me that move.

                            THERESA
              Quincy, never-you-mind. And take
              those things off in the house!
              Jill, stop with the book and eat
              your breakfast.
                     (then, exasperated)
              Marcus, why do I always have to
              discipline the kids? You play
              bad cop for a second.
     Alongside the kitchen screen door we see Lowrey's PORSCHE
     ROAR to a stop in the driveway.
                            BURNETT
              Kids, knock it off... or your
              momma's gonna whoop your butts!
     Theresa laughs in spite of herself as the kids continue
     to fight. Into this craziness enters Mike Lowrey...
                            LOWREY
              Ah, family life. Reminds me
              why I stay single.
                             JILL & QUINCY
              Uncle Mike!   Uncle Mike!
                             LOWREY
              Hiya, kids.   Mornin', Theresa.
     Lowrey pecks Theresa on the cheek.   She recoils.
                            THERESA
              Don't kiss me, Lowrey. I don't
              know where those lips were last
              night.

              I don't want him knowing about it
              either! Gives him ideas.
                     (answers the phone)
              Hello? Oh, sure. Which one of
              them do you want?
     Lowrey accepts the phone from Theresa and talks.
                            LOWREY
              You're live with Lowrey.
                     (listens for a
                      long beat)
              'Scuse me, Captain. I think you
              mean to say, 'Get the fuck down
              here, please?'
     Burnett automatically pulls on his jacket, hugs the
     children as Lowrey hangs up.

                            THERESA
              Not so fast. You were going to
              take the kids to school today,
              remember, hon? I have a job

     Lowrey rolls his eyes.

     door when his neighbor, DICK, accosts him from across
     the hedge.

               Hey, Marcus. Did you know we got
               busted into again last night? When
               are you gonna do something about this?
                             BURNETT
               Hey, Dick. How many times I gotta
               tell you? I don't work robbery.
               I'm in Narcotics.
      Meanwhile, Lowrey's holding the car door open as the kids
      pile into the jump seat in the back.
                             LOWREY
               Don't get your sticky fingers all
               over my windows... and keep your
               feet off the seats, I just had the
               leather conditioned.
      The kids ignore him, gleefully continuing to squirm
      around. Before Burnett can get into the car, Theresa
      runs out.
                             THERESA
               Marcus... I need you to stop at
               Save-More on the way home and pick
               up exactly what's on the list.
      She hands Burnett a long list.
                              BURNETT
               Oh, baby.   Damn.
      Lowrey shakes his head.

     Burnett and Lowrey know there's big problems when, at the
     bottom of the stairwell, the first thing they see is a
     yellow police tape and fingerprint team dusting a torched
     lock. Problem is, the building is nothing but cops and
     it looks as if the entire department is stomping all over
     the evidence room.

     Both laugh hysterically, while:

              If it ain't the leftovers from
              Miami Vice. Fashion casualties,
              lost somewhere in the eighties.
                            BURNETT
              And the women really go for that.
              Really, they do.
     As Burnett and Lowrey duck the tape, they note a very
     groggy O'Fee over in the corner being attended by a
     paramedic team. He's still out cold. An oh shit look
     passes between the two partners.

     Another torched lock noted as Burnett and Lowrey enter
     with Sanchez an Ruiz behind them. The room is emptied.
     Captain HOWARD appears. He's short, has a military
     haircut, and has a minor Napoleon complex and a major in
     paranoia.

              Nice of you to roll in. And
              nothing particular is going on
              around here except, maybe, your
              dope is gone. That's right. The
              biggest dope bust in the history
              of this department up and walked
              out of this locker, along with

              if we don't get the shit back.

              So here's what we're gonna do.
              Since it was originally your
              case, you two guys are on point.
              Sanchez and Ruiz, you back them
              up with whatever they need.
     Groans all around.
                            LOWREY
              So I guess we should start with
              the C.I.s and the perps from the
              original case. But hell if I
              know any dope dealers with the
              balls to pull this off. They're
              either dead or in the lock-up
              pending trial.
                               BURNETT

                            SINCLAIR (O.S.)
              Oh, he'll be just fine.
     From the side appears a cigar-chewing Internal Affairs
     suit named SINCLAIR. He circles close to Burnett and
     Lowrey, waving his cigar as he speaks.
                            HOWARD
              Name's Sinclair. Internal
              Affairs. He's our new proctologist.
                            SINCLAIR
              You see, what's got me confused
              is, why risk leaving a witness?
              Why not kill O'Fee instead?

                            BURNETT
              Because maybe this guy knows if
              you kill a cop the whole
              department'll get up his ass
              hard and fast.
                            SINCLAIR
              And who knows that better than
              anybody else? Cops.
                            BURNETT
              You're not sayin' this was an
              inside job. Cops wouldn't pull
              this shit.

              Enough. I.A.'s in it and there's
              nothing we can do about it. If
              any of this leaks, the shit's

              Remember him? The mayor? He
              created us and you can bet your
              jobs, boys, he'll rip us into
              little cop pieces. I figure we

     CLOSE ON BURNETT
     He walks to the center of the room and kneels to those
     four bolt holes in the floor. He fingers the paraffin
     filler, then looks above to the air conditioning grate.

                            BURNETT

              For one, it was your idea. Two,
              while my suit's fresh, you're
              dressed for the occasion.
                            BURNETT
              Don't say nothin' about my
              clothes. I paid for these.
                               LOWREY
              And I don't?
                            BURNETT
              Not on a cop's salary.

     Burnett crawls up with some help from Lowrey below,
     stalling the oscillating fan with his cuffs and crawling
     through. The first thing Burnett notices are the track
     marks from the bobsled cutting through a coating of dust.
                             LOWREY
              Anything?
                            BURNETT
              Yeah. I got some weird track
              marks in here.
     Then Burnett notes a manufacturing stamp at the joint.
     It reads: ORONA AIR CONTITIONING SYSTEMS, INC.

              Comfy? Maybe there's a new career
              for you in building maintenance.

              There's gonna be a lotta cash
              when the dope hits the street.
              We want you to put the word out
              through your bank and hustle the
              account.  You help us, maybe we
              can see about getting those R.T.C.
              auditors off your ass.
                            LOWREY
              Listen, Cedras. You and I both
              know you're the number one importer
              for the Simona Brothers. And I'm
              tellin' you there's a buttload of
              H on the move and someone's gonna
              wanna stick their dick in it. So
              it better not be yours. You hear
              something? You call us. You hear
              nada? You better get the fuck
              outta town.

      Lowrey's driving, no seatbelt, doing his usual speed-
      weaving. Burnett's hanging onto the handle above the
      door.
                             BURNETT
               Not a fucking lead. So now that
               we've done the obvious, we need
               a shortcut.
                              LOWREY
               Okay.   So we talk to Max.
                             BURNETT
               Huh uh. Not this time. I'm
               tired of you working pussy into
               everything we do.
                             LOWREY
               You got a better idea?

      Once-colorful stucco, fading and crumbling. Scrappy
      Cuban fighters spar and work out on the aging equipment
      while, at the same time, a remarkable amount of amazing-
      looking women work out on weight bags, shadow box with
      trainers. Curves and sweat, any way you look.

      BURNETT AND LOWREY

      enter. And while Lowrey cruises amongst the sweaty flesh
      as if it were a day in the park, Burnett lags. Maybe he
      has been married too long.

      CLOSE ON MAX LOGAN
      she's doing sit-ups on an incline bench.     She notices
      Lowrey.
                              MAX

     This room isn't enclosed. It's walled by wire mesh.
     Private enough, though. Max shuts the door.

                            LOWREY
              Sorry to come around only when
              I need something.
                            MAX
              Forget about it. I owe you the
              rest of my life, Mike.
     Lowrey just gives her an "oh please" look.

     Burnett is surrounded by beautiful, sweaty women. One of
     them is a fabulous BLACK WOMAN with legs so long and
     toned, they're not just legs, they're weapons. Burnett
     can't help but stare.

              Oooh.    I love cops.
     The other girls are suddenly interested, too.   Burnett
     swallows and...
                            BURNETT
              You know? I'm a cop. I shot
              somebody just last week. Didn't
              kill him, just shot him in the
              ass.
     Stone cold looks from them all. They walk away with
     Burnett giving a "what did I say" look. Lowrey appears.
                            LOWREY
              You know, that was really smooth.
              Think you could do that again?
                     (as they start
                      walking)
              Ohh. I'll tell you, when the wife
              gets meaner, the grass gets greener.
                            BURNETT
              Green ain't the color I was

              Just real shiny, thick...

     He switches it OFF.

     Burnett drives cautiously while both he and Lowrey bob
     to Ice-T's "COP KILLER." They get a kick out of the
     song.
                            LOWREY
                     (complies)
              Miami's the perfect town for you,
              Burnett. You drive like a one-
              hundred-seven-year-old lady with
              her turn signal on.
                            BURNETT
              And I plan on living to be old
              just like 'em. Rubbin' Ben Gay
              on my joints and everythin'.

     An old guy passes them even though his car is pulling
     an Airstream camper behind it. Lowrey can't believe it.
                            LOWREY
              You gonna let every old
              motherfucker pass you? Or just
              the ones with big-ass trailers
              draggin' behind? A-c-c-el-er-ate.
                            BURNETT
              I don't have a death wish like
              you. I  got a family that counts
              on me.  A mortgage to pay. And
              I'm not sayin' it's me, but most
              of the guys in the station think
              you're some rich kid playin' cop.
                            LOWREY
              Who said that?

     Burnett mumbles an answer.
                            LOWREY
              If somebody's talking about me, I
              wanna know... Man, I'm so sick of
              this. I don't apologize for
              nothing I do. I get up early and
              take it to the max every day. I'm
              always the first guy through the
              door. And the last guy to leave a
              crime scene. So fuck 'em all. I
              could give a shit what those boot
              lickin', brown-nosin', ass kissin'
              motherfuckers think of Mike Lowrey.
     What can Burnett say to all that, but...

     embarrassed.

              Yeah. Roger that. Gimme the

     Burnett and Lowrey step from their unmarked car and

              The air conditioning business
              has been good to Orona.

     The door is unlocked and swings open easily to reveal
     Lowrey and Burnett in an instant, repulsed reaction to
     Orona's body which sits upright in his office chair, the
     body grotesque and bloated.
                               LOWREY
              Now what?
     A sickened Burnett goes over to the body, speaking to
     Orona as if he were alive.
                            BURNETT
              Where are the drugs?
                     (no answer)
              Where... are... the... drugs?
                     (shrugs)
              He ain't sayin' nothin'. He must
              be guilty of somethin'.
     Meanwhile, Lowrey's got   no problem with the dead body.
     He tries opening a desk   drawer, but Orona's rigor mortis-
     stiffened knee is in the   way. So Lowrey gives it a shove
     and the chair swivels.    Orona's dead arm sweeps the lamp
     off the desk.
                            BURNETT
              Whoa. Watch where you're swinging
              them dead arms, Orona. You're
              gonna fuck up your own crime
              scene.

      beautiful as Max and dressed to be undressed. She drops
      one of those big, model's shoulder bags to the floor and
      gazes curiously back at Lois and Max. Her ears are
      burning.

              It's a favor for a friend. If it

              A favor?
                            MAX
              You know, my friend Mike Lowrey.

                     (rolls her eyes)
              Mike Lowrey. Not again. Will you
              just have sex with the man and get
              it over with.
                            MAX
              He's just a friend.
                               JULIE
              Yeah, right.     You're in love.
                            MAX
              It's never gonna happen. I'm
              great at turning lovers into
              friends. But turning friends
              into lovers, I can't do.
                            JULIE
              Well, I don't date cops. They
              never have enough money and
              they're always too tired to
              screw.
                            MAX
              Well, I've told you before, my
              Mike isn't like that. If I were
              in real trouble, Mike Lowrey is
              the only person I'd call.

     Upon arrival, the door is opened to Max and Julie by
     Eddie Dominguez, instantly recognizeable from the heist.
     Eddie's pouring champagne into a glass.
                             EDDIE
               Max, my little carina. It's
               been a long time. And who's
               your friend?
                              MAX
               Eddie.   Julie.

     Julie sizes him up.    Good taste.   His suit.   Bad taste.
     His personality.
                             EDDIE
               Come on, Julie. Come in, Max.
               Welcome to the Al Capone suite.
     Thev're stepped into a grand, opulent suite. High
     arched ceilings. Magnificent antique furniture. Killer
     view. No party guests.
                             EDDIE
               I'm not kidding. Capone had
               the place fixed up with secret
               passages and hidden stairways.
               Can you dig it? People were
               actually killed within these
               walls.
     He's moved behind them and reveals a concealed staircase
     that rises into darkness.


     CLOSE ON JULIE
     Not happy. Stuck at the Biltmore with a Scarface
     wannabe. She looks over at Max. Let's get outta here.
                              JULIE
               Excuse me?   I need to use the
               bathroom.
     Julie crosses to the bathroom.
                             EDDIE
               Wow, Maxi. I thought you dropped
               off the edge of the earth and died.
               Either that or you moved to
               California.

              what Eddie's got to play with.
     From underneath the couch Eddie reveals a single key of
     heroin. Max tries to hide the recognition that she just
     hit paydirt on the very first try.

     Where she's silently cursing Max for getting her into
     this lame-ass party when she hears MUFFLED VOICES outside
     the bathroom. Instinctively, Julie peers through the
     louvered shades.

61   JULIE'S POV - THROUGH SHADES                               61
     She sees Eddie opening the door to Fouchet.   Casper and

              I could use a friend who looks
              like you. Turn around. Lemme
              get a good look.
     Max tries to size this man, then chooses to submit. She
     does her best model's turn. Slowly giving him a view of
     the rear when --
     Fouchet draws a PISTOL -- BAM BAM!!
     Max tumbles forward and CRASHES through a GLASS TABLE.

               I don't need anybody. I got three
               little angels looking over my
               shoulder.

     REVERSE SHOT - EDDIE'S CHAIR
     Fouchet UNLOADS THREE MORE SHOTS.    BAM BAM BAM!!!   Blood
     spatters onto Casper.
                            CASPER
               Aw, man. You got blood on my
               new suit.

     Half-panicked, half-trying to keep her head. There's no
     way out of the bathroom. All she can do is switch off
     the light. And now she sees Casper's shadow as he
     approaches.

     CLOSE ON DOORKNOB
     As it turns. Julie suddenly reaches for it and pulls
     open the door with a surge. Casper stumbles in, his
     face hitting the hard tile with a crunch.

66   INT. CAPONE SUITE - JULIE                                  66

     Making her move, she hauls as fast as she can across the
     room. Aiming for that secret fireplace door.

     FOUCHET
     Wheels with his PISTOL, unloads the clip. BULLETS are
     catching up, ripping up the couch and the rest of the
     suite. Julie dives right into the secret door.

67   INT. SECRET PASSAGEWAY - SAME TIME                         67
     Dark. Twisting. We MOVE WITH Julie as she races through
     it, heart in her throat. She comes upon some old metal
     stairs, a sliver of light at the top, and clambers up...

68   EXT. BELL TOWER - NIGHT                                    68
     High atop the Biltmore, this is where the passageway
     leads out to. A door flies open and Julie appears.
     Panicked. Wind whipping all around her. A bird flies
     by, startling her. Hearing the APPROACHING THUGS, Julie
     sprints as best she can across the Spanish-tiled roof.
     Turns to see --

69   EXT. BELL TOWER - NIGHT                                    69
     Noah and Casper appear in the Bell Tower. Noah scans
     the roof, takes aim and FIRES, but he's too far away --
     and Julie disappears behind a rise in the roof.

70   EXT. BILTMORE - ROOFTOP - JULIE - NIGHT                    70
     She steps towards the edge of the roof. Quickly peers
     over. A huge swimming pool, five stories down.

              Now look. My fuckin' shoes.      My
              fuckin' Italian shoes!
     Then Julie prays silently, takes a running start and
     leaps from the roof. SLOW-MOTION as Julie flies through
     the air like some glamorous angel.

     been photographed and are covered. Chief Howard is
     conferring with a technician who's dusting for prints.

     BURNETT AND LOWREY

     But Sanchez and Ruiz are already on the scene.

               You guys watch where you're walking
               or you'll fuck up the crime scene.

               Looks like you're already doing
               that.
     Burnett's quick to point out the trail of bloody foot-
     prints Ruiz just tracked across the carpet.

     CLOSE ON CHAMPAGNE GLASS
     Which Julie left on the fireplace mantel. Lowrey's quick
     to note the two separate shades of lipstick.

               Two dead. A hood registered as
               Eddie Dominguez and some Jane
               Doe. But the table over there's
               covered in high-grade dope. Sound
               familiar?
                                LOWREY
               I think we    got us a witness.
               Over here    I got two different
               shades of    lipstick on one
               champagne    glass.

     Burnett drops the sheet, turns and puts a protective
     shoulder between Lowrey and the body.
                               LOWREY
              What?     Who is it?
     Lowrey instintively pushes past his partner and kneels
     at the body. He pulls back the sheet. Right now he
     could kill the shooter, then himself. In that order.
     Lowrey's eyes well up.
                            LOWREY
              I shoulda told you to be careful.

     The elevator doors open and out step Burnett and Lowrey
     into a lobby full of cops. Lowrey goes straight to the
     front desk.
                            LOWREY
              Eddie Dominguez. I want his
              phone calls.
     He flashes a badge.
                            HOTEL CLERK
              You pay the bill you can see
              his phone calls.
                               LOWREY
              I'm sorry.     Maybe I wasn't polite
              enough.
     With a flashing right jab, Lowrey pops the snooty Clerk.
     After the Clerk finds his feet, eyes peering over the
     counter...
                            BURNETT
              I wouldn't fuck with him right

               and tell her a bedtime story.
               You can catch a ride with Howard.
     Lowrey jumps in the car.

     Replete with balcony and billowy curtains, the old-styled
     madame LOIS FIELDS sits up on her bed covered in pillows
     and exotic stuffed animals. She thumbs an old, leather-
     bound looseleaf binder full of modeling photos and
     resumes.

     radio with one hand and his pistol with the other.

     Lowrey eases inside the darkness of the doorway. He
     checks the lights, but the power is off. Slipping the
     radio into his coat pocket, he returns with a mini-
     flashlight and begins to clear a path, doorway by

     MOVING THROUGH the doors of the master suite where a light

     turns ever-so-slowly with his flashlight following a beat

     laying on the bed amongst huge pillows and exotic stuffed

     Julie's. Lowrey goes    for the phone. Picks it up with
     his handkerchief. No    dial tone. So he drops the
     receiver and heads out   of the room. But just as he
     reaches the doorway --
     Suddenly -- Lowrey's BEEPER SOUNDS.
     He jumps.    Reaches down to switch it off when --
     From out of those billowing curtains -- Noah!
     Sledgehammer in hand, he swings at Lowrey, who instinc-
     tively blocks and ducks as the hammer misses and crushes
     the bannister railing. It gives under Lowrey's weight,
     who reaches over and traps the sledgehammer, only to find
     one of Noah's hammy fists battering him behind the ear
     until --
     The rail finally gives way.
     Lowrey falls and crashes onto a Craftsman table covered
     in antique picture frames. It collapses underneath him.

     He notices his gold wedding band, hastily removes it.
     Just as he drops it into his jacket pocket --
                              JULIE (O.S.)
              Who's there?
                              BURNETT
              Mike Lowrey.
     INTERCUT WITH:

91   INT. JULIE'S APARTMENT                                         91
     She stands on the other side of the door with a baseball
     bat, cocked and ready to fly.
                            JULIE
              How do I know it's Detective
              Lowrey?
                            BURNETT
              ... 'Cuz I'm Mike Lowrey.      I'm a
              cop. Wanna see my badge?
                            JULIE
              Yes! I wanna see it now! I'm
              not letting you through the fucking
              door until I do. Hold it up to
              the peephole!
     Burnett shows his shield.    Holds it up to the peephole.
                            JULIE
              Anybody can get one of those.

                            BURNETT
                     (annoyed)
              Hey, lady. You called me,
              remember...? 'On the mike with
              Mike.'
     After a beat, the door swings ajar.

92   INT. JULIE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS ACTION                     92
     But as Burnett enters the house, all he notices are that
     two DOGS start YAPPING HYSTERICALLY. He can't see her.
     But she can see him. From behind the door, she comes out
     swinging a bat. Burnett ducks and Julie smashes the hat
     stand instead.

                            JULIE
              You're not Mike Lowrey!
                            BURNETT
              What do you mean I'm not Mike
              Lowrey? You never even met
              him! Me.
                            JULIE
              The way Max described you was
              different.

                            BURNETT
              I'm undercover.
     She doesn't believe him and swings the bat.
                              BURNETT
              Okay.    I'm way undercover.
                             JULIE
              Prove it!
                            BURNETT
              I knew her from way back. From
              time to time, you know... We'd get
              together. Mess around, you know?
                             JULIE
              Wrong.
     Julie swings for real, nearly taking Burnett's head off.

                            BURNETT
              Okay. Okay. So I exaggerated.
              It's a man thing.
     She swings again, but he's had enough, he moves quickly,
     catching the bat with his hand and ripping it away from
     her.
                            BURNETT
              You know what? You don't wanna
              believe me? That's fine with me!
              Go it alone.
     Burnett heads toward the open door.     Julie's veneer drops
     as she shrinks to the floor.

              I saw it all... I watched him
              shoot her. Like she was nothing.
                     (trying to hold
                      it together)
              Please shut the door.
                            BURNETT
              You don't got any more golf clubs
              or bats, do you? Nothin' that you
              can swing at me, do you?
     She shakes her head.     He carefully steps forward.
                            BURNETT
              Then lemme introduce myself. I'm
              Mike Lowrey. And I'm here to help
              you.
                            JULIE
              You're not what I expected.
                            BURNETT
              Yeah, well neither are you.      You
              swing like Barry Bonds.
     Burnett nods and crosses over to help Julie to her feet.
                            BURNETT
              Alright. Look here, I need to
              know if you've called anybody.
              Or if you told anybody else where
              you are?
                               JULIE
              No.   Nobody.

                               BURNETT
              Good.     You got a back door?
     Julie nods, scoops up one of her dogs and grabbing
     another modeling bag off the table.
                            JULIE
              Where are we going?

                 with you. Otherwise, I'll take
                 my chances.
     Burnett's getting a "not again" look on his face when --
     KUH-BOOM!
     A SHOTGUN BLAST blows the front door open.       Clutching the
     bag, Julie races around the living room.

                                 BURNETT
                 Let's go!

     Burnett sees the second dog cowering in the corner.       So
     he lunges over, scoops the dog up.

     It's Casper, Noah and Kuni!

     BURNETT AND JULIE
     Racing through the apartment toward the back door,
     Burnett wheels with the GUN and FIRES just as Kuni rounds
     a corner with the SHOTGUN. The room ERUPTS with plaster
     spray and NOISE. Julie shrieks, and Burnett shoves her
     through the back door, then spins and FIRES. Kuni
     tumbles and dies from multiple hits.

               Fine time to bark. Where were you

               Shit. Bet they got a look at my
               license plates. If you saw him

      Burnett walks over to CHET, the doorman, a shifty little
      guy who's always got his hand out. He's sitting on a
      folding chair reading Penthouse Forum.

               Didn't mention it to me.
      Chet holds out his hand. Burnett slips him ten. Chet
      sneaks a peek over at the car, sees Julie putting on
      lipstick.

               Say.   How's that Mrs. Burnett?
      Burnett realizes this is going to cost him more. Gives
      him another ten. But for Chet it's still not enough.
                             CHET
               Your children good? Mr. Lowrey

               Now that I think about it, Mr.

               I forgot I had those switches moved.

      Julie enters, looking left and right, cautious but
      impressed by the stylish digs.

               Right. What was your last pick?
               A horse in the number two race at
               Pimlico? Or did a bookie give you
               an inside tip.


      CLOSE ON WINE RACK

               Fair enough. I'm not on the take.
               Satisfied? Good. So... why don't
               you make yourself at home? Here's
               the T.V. remote. Watch yourself
               some 'Gilligan's Island' reruns or
               somethin'.

               Heh -- all these damn things look
               alike.
                      (switches it off)
               Well, gotta run... There's probably
               a couple of good steaks in the
               fridge for the dogs. Help yourself
               to whatever.

               I'll check on you in the morning.

               Where are you going?
                             BURNETT
               Uh, back to the P.D. I got
               paperwork back on my desk to go
               through that's about this high.
                      (to his armpits)
               And now there's you, so that makes

      To his neck.

               You mean, you're going to leave me

                             BURNETT
               Why shouldn't I? Are you a thief

               Of course not. And I'm not a call
               girl, either.
                               BURNETT
               I didn't ask.
                             JULIE
               I know you didn't. I just thought
               you should know.

               Okay. Important lesson. Julie's
               not a call girl. Can I go now?
                             JULIE
               Just one more thing.
      Julie steps forward and wraps her arms around Burnett.
      It's a one-way hug. Uncomfortable, Burnett doesn't
      reciprocate other than a palsy pat on the back.
                              JULIE
               Thank you.   For everything.
                             BURNETT
               Don't mention it.
      Burnett tries to break toward the door when the PHONE
      RINGS. Burnett stares at the phone, not knowing what
      to do.

               Hi. You're live with Lowrey.
               Leave it at the beep.
      The PHONE BEEPS.
                             YVETTE (V.O.)
               Miiike... it's Yvette... I know I
               told you I don't date cops. And I
               know I told you I wouldn't sleep
               with a man I wasn't going to marry.
               But I've been thinking -- and I
               remember when you said thinking was
               a dangerous thing -- so I started
               feeling... well, lonely. Remember
               when you gave me that key --
      Burnett charges over and shuts OFF the MACHINE.
                             BURNETT
               It's uh... It's uh...

               You don't have to explain.
      Finally, they've reached consensus.     Burnett grins and
      is out the door.
                             BURNETT
               Lock the door. Don't open it for
               anybody.

      As Burnett is racing back through to the car, he sees
      Chet behind the desk and stops.
                             BURNETT
               Listen, Chet. The girl? She's a

               about an hour. Do me a favor.

                             CHET
               You know, Mr. Burnett. I'm getting
               off in just a few minutes, so... I
               could watch the door if you like.
               You know. In a chair. I could
               just sit in it. Outside the door
               like cops do when they're guarding
               shit.
                             BURNETT
               Just keep an eye out.
      Heads for the door.
                             CHET
               Yeah, I was gonna be a cop, you
               know? Just didn't work out. You
               know? Politics.

      Howard is in sweats, awkwardly shooting free throws as
      his morning workout. Parked on either side of the hoop,
      Lowrey and Burnett patiently retrieve each missed ball
      and send it back to him.
                             BURNETT
               Chief. I tried to set   the girl
               up with a sketch artist  but she
               won't. I tried to get   her to come
               in and look at the mug  books and
               she won't come in.
                             HOWARD
               She'll only deal with Mike Lowrey.
      He tosses a brick.
                             BURNETT
               That's right. So let her deal
               with the real Mike Lowrey! Who,
               I might add, shoulda been there to
               take the call instead of runnin'
               off like a hot dog without any
               backup.
      Howard fires another missed shot. He's so bad, it's all
      Burnett and Lowrey can do to keep from spiking the ball.
                             LOWREY
               Hey. I'm not the one who left a
               strange hooker alone in my
               apartment. You know, she's
               probably on the street sellin'
               all my shit as we speak.

               Yeah, I got a computer and you
               shouldn't touch it. It took me
               weeks to get it set up the way I
               want it and I don't want amateurs
               messing with it.

               the girl on Lowrey's super duper
               computer.
                             BURNETT
               So what about me? I can't    tell my
               wife I'm shacked up with a   female
               witness! Besides, I think    they
               made my car last night... I   gotta
               stay close to home, just in   case.
                            HOWARD
               Easy. Lowrey moves into your
               house. And you're on special
               assignment.
      Another brick.

               But what about us? The
               neighborhood's had all break-ins.

               Yes, Lowrey. I trust him with my

               Baby. It's a Federal subpoena.
               I'm the witness. I'm the one who
               has to testify. Case closed. I'm

                He's dropping it off at the
                mechanic on the way to the
                airport. The engine  needs an
                overhaul... or will by the time
                he gets there.
      The Porsche heads down the block with a GRINDING of
      GEARS. Lowrey winces and heads for the Volvo when
      Theresa gets in his way.
                              THERESA
                Where you think you're going? I
                got a list here of things that
                Marcus was supposed --
                              LOWREY
                -- that Marcus was supposed to do.
                That's right. Marcus. Not Mike.
                'Cuz Mike's a cop on a case with
                no time to waste.
      Lowrey's in the Volvo and pulling away as fast as he can.

      One of Miami's famous canals, derelict ships are docked
      and rusting. One such ship, an old freighter called the
      Mariana.

      and stairwells INTO a single, massive hold converted
      into a drug-processing lab. Huge, bakery-sized mixing
      BOWLS CHUG on one side of the room while lab workers form
      the doughy, cut heroin into pizza-sized forms, and shovel
      them into tractor ovens on the other side of the room.
      When the pies come out, more lab assistants re-form the
      pies into keys.


      ON FOUCHET
      He's dealing with his 26-year-old chemist named ELLIOT.
                             FOUCHET
               Okay. Explain it to me, Elliot.
               Why are we behind?
                             ELLIOT
               The cutting agent is highly
               volatile. You can't cook it like
               you would a pizza. I had to gear
               the ovens down to half-speed.
                             FOUCHET
               We already accounted for that,
               Elliot. It's in our fucking
               timetable. So what else?

      Elliot is uncomfortable. He looks back at WALLY, his
      stoned-looking assistant, before forging ahead.
                             ELLIOT
               There's too much moisture down
               here. The pies are taking longer
               to cook than we originally
               planned.
                              WALLY
               Yeah.   It's totally fucked.
                             FOUCHET
               You.  Shut up.
                      (back to Elliot)

               We're not making pizza.

                Can you bring me the lotion on

      Burnett enters.    Julie has a towel wrapped around her

      Julie, obviously free with her body, suddenly drops the
      towel and starts applying lotion. Burnett averts his
      eyes, turning around a full one-eighty, but finds himself
      facing a mirror. Oops. Looks left, another shiny
      surface.   Shit.

      He steps from the bathroom and stands outside the door.

                             JULIE
               The guy who killed Max. Now, he
               was looking for the heroin that
               Eddie stole from him... Max went
               to the party as a favor to you.

               So this isn't about Max's death
               at all. It's about dope.

      Burnett exits the closet to find Julie   brushing out her
      wet hair, wearing nothing but what she   described, a T-
      shirt and pair of Lowrey's boxers tied   up with a shoe
      string. This ensemble never looked so    good.

               look at. 'Scuse me, I gotta hook

      He heads out of the bedroom.

               Hey, Mike. Who's the guy in all
               the pictures?
      Burnett turns. And there behind Julie is a wall full of
      photos that he's never, ever noticed. Nearly all of
      Lowrey. All ego.

               That guy? Well, that's Marcus
               Burnett, my partner.
      Burnett gets closer and must look around until he finds
      the singular photo of the two of them. It's in a shitty
      frame, too.

               Listen, Mike. I've known a lotta
               guys. And I've seen a good number
               of their bedrooms, okay? But I've
               never seen... I mean, look at it.

      Burnett is cleaning up dog shit    from one of Lowrey's
      Persian rugs. The stain won't     come out. So Burnett
      tries a can that he's grabbed.     It foams. Julie appears
      with a pile of clean laundry in    hand.
                              BURNETT
                Your dog took a shit.
                              JULIE
                And you used Pledge to clean it
                up?

                Well, that makes a big difference.
                You just varnished that into the
                fabric. I'm sure it works great.
      Burnett doesn't quite know what    to do with the wad of
      dog poop in paper towels still    in his hand. Julie
      snatches it from him and heads    for the bathroom. Burnett
      follows. He suddenly realizes     that the clean clothes are
      his.

      turbing. A shirt of his has a large bleached area on it.

               Thought the kids deserved to
               know about the hero they have

               Husband? Theresa. He's your
               personal errand boy. You beep
               the poor S.O.B. every hour on
               the Goddamn hour? And why is
               it always about some useless
               bullshit that can wait until
               later. I mean, the guy's gotta
               job to do.

               You wanna know why I page him?
               Because until that phone rings,
               I don't know whether he's dead
               or alive. And lemme tell you.
               Those three minutes I'm waiting
               for him to call back? Those are
               the hardest three minutes for a

               drove your kids to school this

                Man, it's off. It was a joke.
                              BURNETT
                Hey, man. Don't mess with me!
                That's the mother of my children.
                Don't break up a happy home.

A132   INT. SAVE-MORE DRUGS - MORNING (Formerly Sc. 207)         A132

       Lowrey is annoyed. He holds the list Theresa just gave
       him as they walk down the aisle.
                              LOWREY
                Marcus, this is crazy. We are
                five minutes away from picking
                up this asshole and returning
                to our lives. And we're here
                doin' this shit. Where the fuck
                is it?
                             BURNETT
                Hey. Don't ask me to find it for
                you. You're the expert on my
                wife.

                              LOWREY
                You know, this is like some really
                bizarre shit that you're on right
                now. Your wife asked me to do
                this, and I'm doin' it. Besides,
                I'm you, remember?
                              BURNETT
                You don't even know where you're
                going. You're in the wrong aisle.
       Lowrey follows Burnett to the next aisle, where Burnett
       gestures to the wall of feminine hygiene products.
                              BURNETT
                You think you know what Theresa
                needs, man, but I do this every
                month.
                       (challenges)
                Just look for 'Fresh Days.'
       Lowrey moves ahead.   There's too much to look at.
                              LOWREY
                You're unbalanced. Listen, I
                read the parole jacket on this
                guy Noah. Armed robbery.
                Attempted murder. He's a violent
                offender somethin' like nine
                times. Sweet guy. Not a single
                drug bust on his sheet.
                              BURNETT
                So? He's a new recruit. Keep
                looking, will ya? 'Fresh Days.'

                              LOWREY
                You know, it is a damn shame she
                makes you buy this stuff.
                              BURNETT

                It's like shaving cream.

       shelf.

                Hey, man, look! You're not even

       A woman chooses this moment to walk by.

                That's a whole 'nother category

                spends all his time chasing
                pussy, you sure don't know much
                about the woo woo.

      Burnett and Lowrey park and pop the trunk.    Inside are
      guns and uniforms.
                             BURNETT
               What are we gonna be today? Postal
               Inspectors or Water and Power?
                             LOWREY
               Water and Power.

133   EXT. TRAILER - DAY                                          133
      Approaching are Burnett and Lowrey, but now they're
      dressed in shorts and T-shirts with bright orange vests
      and caps reading "Water and Power." And as Lowrey knocks
      on the door.

      CLOSE ON HEAVY LINK CHAIN
      Wrapped around a pink refrigerator.    It moves.
                             BURNETT
               What do you think the chain's for?
                             LOWREY
               I dunno. Maybe some kind of
               hurricane anchor.
      They knock again.    The chain jerks slightly.
                             BURNETT
               Well, the anchor just moved.
      Both turn and look. And the chain is moving. At first,
      it simply sways back and forth, then it pulls taut and
      the FRIDGE JOLTS! A deep, GUTTURAL NOISE sounds. From
      around the corner, a shadow grows large. Lowrey and
      Burnett instinctively withdraw their guns and aim just as
      a LION rounds the corner, teeth bared, claws tearing at
      the deck.
      The door swings open.
      Burnett pushes Lowrey inside just as the big cat lunges.

               Who are you?!
      Lowrey and Burnett heave, then turn. They're equally
      shocked to find a huge, three-hundred-pound WOMAN in
      nothing but her underwear.
                             BURNETT

               Listen. The cat don't belong to
               me. It belong to my brother. And
               I don't know where he is.
                             BURNETT
               That's too bad. Because his
               lion's tied to your trailer. So
               you gotta move the beast. Or move
               the trailer.

               I'll be ready in just a minute.
               I thought I'd have you tell --
      She stalls at the sight of Lowrey, a little spark of
      interest passes between them.

               They get nervous in new

               for the cleaning, but Mike

      Lowrey spots rings from glasses on the table.

      runs out with a Cole Hahn loafer in his mouth. They both
      follow him into the bedroom.

      A mysterious WOMAN in an overcoat, sunglasses and spiked
      heels enters.

               Mike?
      The Woman strips off the overcoat -- under which she's
      breathtakingly naked, save for a garter belt and
      stockings. She drapes the coat over the nearest chair.

               I'm feeling really nasty right
               now.

      Burnett is first to appear from the bedroom -- and his
      expression goes off the charts. Startled, the woman
      shrugs back into her coat.

                 up Max's shooter. Anyone got a
                 problem with that?
                               JULIE
                 I feel safer now.
       She turns and exits back into the bedroom. Burnett's
       about to follow when Lowrey swings him outside the door-
       way and gets into his face.
                               LOWREY
                 You are ruining my life!
                               BURNETT
                 Yeah, well this case is messin'

       The ultimate Miami night scene. A long line of local and
       Hip and cool couples are waiting. Lowrey and Burnett
       appear at the front of the line, coolly flashing their
       badges to a hipster couple.

                Hey, man. Got some bad news.
                Your car got busted into. There's
                some uniformed boys in the parking
                lot wanting to ask you some
                questions.
       Pissed and panicked, the hipster pair head for the
       parking lot, while Lowery and Burnett take their place
       near the front of the line.

      Julie, still dressed for the evening, paces back and
      forth. Frustrated, she rips the tag from her dress, and
      sits back down at the computer. She plays with the
      keyboard and Noah's mug shot pops back into view. She
      stares at it a little too intently. Images flash in
      front of her, the sights and sounds of Max's death
      replaying itself in her mind.
      Snapping out of it, determined, she gathers her bag and
      exits.

      on cruise control, this club massed with people.

      High above the room, Fouchet looks out upon the dance
      floor with both Noah, Casper, and Ferguson behind him.

               My three little angels told me I'd
               get a visit from the cops tonight

                      (turns and orders)
               When they split up, we'll drop
               the tall one and get the other
               one to lead us to the girl.

      Lowrey and Burnett move to the bar.   There's a huge
      fishtank behind it.
                             LOWREY
               I say we split the room in half.
               Make our own moves. Hook back up
               at the bar in twenty minutes.

               Sounds good to me.
      Lowrey moves off and Burnett turns to the female

      Julie pulls up in Lowrey's Porsche. Before the valet
      can get to the door, she's opening Lowrey's glove box.
      In it there's a pistol. Julie mulls it over before
      removing it and stuffing it in her purse.

               I gotta make a pitstop.

      And, believe it or not, the other side of the fishtank
      behind the bar. Burnett's at the urinal, blissfully
      relieving himself when Casper appears at his side.
      There's that awkward men-don't-talk-at-the-urinal moment
      until Burnett leans over...
                                BURNETT

      Which Casper wraps around Burnett's head.       Burnett gags.

                 Okay, hardon!    Tell me where the
                 girl is!
      Casper slams Burnett into the mirror. Burnett struggles,
      reaching for anything, he comes up with the towel dis-
      penser, rips it from the wall and starts pounding over
      Casper's head.

      Lowrey sips on a beer, totally unaware of what's

      Burnett rips the bag off his head, reaches for his gun.
      But Casper's there, lunging into him and lifting him up
      and into the fishtank.

      He's been watching the  fish in the tank, but turns back
      toward the bar just at  the moment of Burnett's impact.
      The tank cracks on the  bathroom side and water begins
      draining, unbeknownst  to Lowrey.

      Burnett's gun lays amongst the flapping carp and sea-
      weed on the floor. Both Burnett and Casper go sliding
      across the wet floor and into a stall -- both reaching
      for the gun. Burnett's there a second too late.
      Casper's got the gun. He swings it onto Burnett and
      squeezes the trigger. But nothing happens. Burnett
      in turn, grabs Casper's ears and hammers the big guy's
      head into the toilet until he falls unconscious. Burnett
      picks up his gun.

       Lowrey, standing at the bar and making conversation with
       one of the club beauties.

      LOWREY
      Launches himself off a nearby table, soars over the
      frightened crowd and comes crashing down upon Noah.
      Both Lowrey and Noah tumble to the floor. Noah's gun
      skitters into the crowd. Noah chases for it, but can't
      find it. But --

      got a clear shot at Julie. He raises his gun, only to
      find Burnett's pistol at his ear.

      across the road and crunches them. Noah throws a SHOTGUN
      over the back seat of his car and FIRES through the rear

       Noah's car clips the pumps. A geyser of gasoline sprays
       into the sky. Noah recovers from the roll. Throws his
       weight into the jammed door. It opens on the second
       shove.

       Just getting out of the car as the station blows.    They
       shield themselves against the explosion.

                There goes our only lead to the
                dope. We better call Howard.

                That's it. That's it.   You're
                both crazy.
       Julie takes a few steps away before she decides to give
       them the other barrel.
                              JULIE
                Protect and serve. Sound familiar?
                Isn't that what you're supposed to
                do? 'Cuz I'd like to know whose
                butt you're protecting.

                I think we protected your
                uninvited butt pretty good back
                there.
                              JULIE
                All you care about is getting your
                dope back. No, that's not all,
                you care about getting it back in
                a way that shows how fucking macho
                and tough you are. It's all some
                big testosterone contest. Well,
                fuck that.
       As Julie walks in one direction, Burnett blows off in the
       other.
                 BURNETT                           LOWREY
       No more. Fuck this. I'm               Chill, I'll handle it.
       not goin' with it... No, I'm                (starts after
       out. I'm out. Somethin's                     Julie)
       wrong with her. Crazy woman!          Julie! Just wait a
                                             minute!
       Burnett keeps moving and grousing while Lowrey chases
       Julie down and snags her by the arm.
                              LOWREY
                Hey, hey. Just relax!
                       (looks for words)
                Okay. It's true this whole thing
                started with missing drugs. But
                somebody I cared about. A lot.
                She got killed. And I'm not gonna
                lay down until this guy is dead
                or put away... And I promise you,
                we'll take care of you.
                              JULIE
                That's what I'm afraid of.
       Once again, Julie pulls away. But Lowrey's got her
       tight... and close. He digs deep.
                              LOWREY
                Hey. What do I gotta say?     I
                need you, okay?
                       (then for real)
                I need you.
       Magic words.   Julie's swayed, despite herself.

       Police units surround  -- flashing lights. Julie is
       shaken, waiting in the  back of a police unit. Meanwhile,
       Ruiz and Sanchez join  Burnett and Lowrey at the trunk of
       the toasted car. The   fire crew crowbars open the lid.
       The trunk gives way to  a ghastly, toxic smell. Everyone
       gags.
                                BURNETT
                 Jesus.   What kinda shit was in

                 Smells like some kinda chemical.
                               BURNETT
                 We'll get a sample and drop it
                 back at the lab. Meanwhile, why
                 don't you two go on back to Club

       As Lowrey is checking the upstairs, he finds himself
       staring in on the sleeping kids.
                                 LOWREY
                 One day, bro.    Gotta get yourself
                 some of them.
       Lowrey hears SOBBING. He gently shuts the kids' door
       and heads down the hall to the:

       Where Theresa sits amongst boxes of new clothes.   Lowrey
       gives a polite rap on the door.
                               LOWREY
                Hey, hey.   That's not cryin' I

                       (wipes tears)
                Oh, it's nothing... I just bought
                some clothes. It's been so long
                since I bought anything nice...
                I just wanted something to wear
                for Marcus when he got home. But
                nothing looks right...

                        again)
                He's slipping away from me, Mike.
                I can feel it.

                Theresa. Listen to me. Nobody's
                slipping away from you. Especially
                not Marcus. You can take my word
                on that... As for the clothes...
       Lowrey pulls a random item out of a box.   It's hideous.
                              LOWREY
                Okay. Just a minor fashion
                faux paux. Those cappuccinos
                at lunch can do that to you...

       lowers his nose to the cushions. The smell gets worse.

                I'm really sorry about the dog
                pee. They must be traumatized by

                for new cushions.

      nightgown.

               Do you always come to bed with your

               So I'm dressed and ready. It's
               okay. I've done it before.
                             JULIE
               Really. You think Marcus would
               wear clothes to bed while on

               Well Marcus. He's very   something
               ... sexy. And the way I   came in
               tonight, he was throwing  everybody
               this way and that and he  took
               control.

               listen. I got something you'll
               want a piece of.


187   INT. PORSCHE (BURNETT'S NEIGHBORHOOD) - NIGHT               187
      GRINDING GEARS, Burnett stops around the corner from his
      house. He turns OFF the IGNITION and turns to Julie.
                             BURNETT
               I got some jewelry for you.
      Before Julie can respond, Burnett's cuffing her to the
      steering wheel.
                            JULIE
               You prick! First you don't want
               me. Then you drag me out...

                       it)
               Oh, wait. I get it. You're one
               of those post-adolescent assholes
               who didn't get any car sex in
               high school --
                             BURNETT
               Just shut the fuck up. I won't be
               long. Try and keep out of sight.
      Burnett's out of the car with the keys. Julie yanks on
      the handcuffs, then goes for the glove box. But this
      time it's empty.


188   INT. SEDAN - FERGUSON AND CASPER - NIGHT                   188
      Casper spots Burnett nearing the house.
                             CASPER
               There's our guy. Watch him.

189   INT. BURNETT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                           189
      Lowrey climbs under blanket on sofa, the back of which
      faces the window. Exhausted, he turns off light and
      closes his eyes. A beat. Burnett's face pops up
      furtively in window, his nose pressed against the glass,
      looking for evidence of adultery. He can't see Lowrey
      asleep on the couch. His head drops below the window
      frame, only to reappear in another window. Seeing
      nothing, he moves on.


190   EXT. BURNETT HOUSE - NIGHT                                 190
      Burnett skulks into the side yard.

191   EXT. THERESA'S BEDROOM WINDOW - BURNETT'S POV              191
      The light in Theresa's bedroom is on. He sees her sil-
      houette against the curtain getting undressed.

192   EXT. SIDE YARD - BURNETT                                   192
      He climbs the trellis to second story; boosts himself
      onto ledge, inches along. Stops to peer into a window
      when the ledge under his feet crumbles and...

       falls. Landing flat on his back on the awning. His eyes
       close with a look that says "saved." But then as he
       moves. Something CREAKS.

       Theresa hears SOMETHING and runs to the door and calls
       out.

                                 THERESA
                 Mike!
       In a heartbeat, Lowrey charges into Theresa's room in his
       underwear.
                               LOWREY
                 What's the matter?
                               THERESA
                 I heard a noise... I think
                 someone's outside...

A194   EXT. AWNING - BURNETT                                      A194
       Seemingly stuck, once again, he attempts to move.
       Another, even LOUDER CREAK, then --

       AWNING

       gives way. And Burnett crashes loudly into the garbage
       cans underneath. Lids and cans go every which way.

B194   EXT. DRIVEWAY - NIGHT                                      B194
       A lid rolls down and into the street.

       He crawls to his feet and as he looks up at the damage
       he's done --

      He sees Lowrey in his underwear and Theresa in her night-
      gown as they part the curtains and look out.

               I come get you.


198   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                     198
      Lowrey takes gun from holster, slams in clip.

199   EXT. FRONT YARD - NIGHT                                      199
      Lowrey switches off the porch lights as he exits house,
      gun ready. Without warning, Burnett leaps from the
      bushes onto Lowrey's back.

      LOWREY'S GUN
      Tumbles into the flower bed. Lowrey reels with     an elbow,
      dropping Burnett to the lawn. But Burnett rolls     and
      clips Lowrey's legs. Lowrey falls. Crawls for      his gun.
      Gets hold of it, turns and is ready to fire when    --


      CAR
      drives past.   The headlights, revealing Burnett.
                              LOWREY

      Lowrey and the two roll around on the lawn.

               She's in the car. Got her cuffed
               to the steering wheel.
      Lowrey could kill now. He's on his feet, grabbing
      Burnett by the collar and shoving him up against the
      front door.

               handled. In the meantime, you

                 I was thinking that... maybe I
                 could see your gun. See, we
                 don't allow guns up in the
                 apartments. Mr. Lowrey usually
                 checks his, here, at the desk
                 with me... You want me to check
                 yours?
       Burnett pulls his gun. But doesn't hand it to Chet.        He
       sticks it in Chet's face.

                Okay. All I know is his name.
                Foo-shay, I think. Got this

                there was quick cash for whoever
                had the balls enough to hook up
                with him. I swear, man, watchin'
                your house was my first gig for
                the guy.

       Burnett stands over the Henchman and lifts his defeated
       chin to face him. Burnett has it in him to give the guy
       one more hard whack for good measure, but that bruised
       face proves punishment enough.
                             BURNETT
                Yeah. I guess you're tellin'
                the truth.

       Two old codgers are trading stories in front of JOJO, a
       white boy with rasta dreadlocks.
                               BURNETT
                Hey, Jojo.
       Through the office window, Jojo sees Burnett and sud-
       denly bolts out the rear door and runs smack dab into
       Lowrey, who body checks him back up against the office
       door.
                              LOWREY
                Good runnin' into you, Jojo.

       Now Burnett has pushed Jojo up onto the sink.   Lowrey
       hangs back, vibrating with anticipation.
                              BURNETT
                Hey, calm down. A little rap,
                that's all. We're lookin' for
                someone who can step on a
                shitload of heroin. And do it
                real fast, and real well.
                We're lookin' for a pro.
                              JOJO
                I'm in the rubber business now.
                              BURNETT
                We're not playin' around with
                you, Jojo. You know what we
                want.

                              JOJO
                I'm tellin' you straight up,
                like a straight fuckin' arrow,
                okay? I'm straight as a board.
                I'm so straight it's fuckin'
                sick.
                              BURNETT
                Now there's a lotta dope, Jojo.
                Who can cut it quick?
                              JOJO
                You mean, cut it... cut it up,
                yeah. I don't know anything about
                anything.
       Lowrey's had it.   He pulls his gun and pushes in.

                             BURNETT
               What are you doin', man?
      As Burnett tries to intercede, they talk over each other.

               LOWREY                           BURNETT
       We don't got time for            Mike. Chill with that.

       shit...
         (reaches behind his
          back)
       Wait. Wait.
       Burnett pushes in one last time and tries to talk Lowrey
       back. Lowrey acts like he lost it. He pulls another
       gun and points it at Burnett.
               LOWREY                           BURNETT
       Back up. I'm gonna bust          Right on. Jojo, you're
       your fuckin' ass too.            on your own.

      Staked out around the corner are Burnett and Lowrey.
      Each is clearly tired of the other. The silence is
      deadly until Julie breaks the silence.
                             JULIE
               So where's the coffee and donuts?
                                BURNETT
               What?
                             JULIE
               I thought that was the usual menu
               when cops were on stakeout. A
               little caffeine for the heart.
               Some sugar-coated dough fried in
               day old grease.
                             LOWREY
               Man. Will you get off this?
               You're making me sick.
                             JULIE
               Oh, I'm sorry, Marcus. All     these
               hours on the case, you must    miss
               Theresa's home cooking.
                      (near Lowrey's ear)
               Bet last night she fixed you    up
               something yummy and left it    in
               the microwave for you.
      Burnett starts to steam.
                              LOWREY
               Yeah.   Somethin' yummy.
                             JULIE
               I imagine there was something
               yummy waiting for you when you

      But Burnett's face    ignites with headlights at their
      rear. Doors open.      Lowrey checks the rear-view mirror.
      He sees two private    security cops named DE SOUZA and
      TOWNE. They split     and approach either side of the
      unmarked sedan.
                                LOWREY
               Oh, man.     It's the fuckin' pretend

      Lowrey rolls down his driver's window in time to hear...
                             TOWNE
               Well, what do we have back here?
               Looks like we got us two pimps
               and a hooker.
                             DE SOUZA
               Hey, fellahs. Maybe if she does
               us both we'll let you leave with
               your pride intact.

                             LOWREY
               Excuse me. One moment.
                      (rolls up the window)
               Let's fuck with these bozos.
      Burnett nods his approval.   Lowrey lowers the window.
                             LOWREY
               Now, where were we?
                             TOWNE
               Outta the car. Hands where we can
               see 'em. Feet spread.
      Both hobby cops open the doors for Lowrey and Burnett
      respectively. Looks pass between them as they step out
      and assume the positions. And Towne starts by frisking
      Burnett's shoulders.
                             BURNETT
               Oh, that's not how you frisk a
               potential lawbreaker. You gotta
               start at the waistband. See if
               he's carrying a piece.
      Towne stalls a beat, then self-consciously goes to
      Burnett's waistband where he feels a --
                             TOWNE
               Gun!
      Both hobby cops instantly withdraw, their own pieces
      drawn and leveled on Burnett and Lowrey.

               helpless pimps and a call girl...
               But it would be even worse if you
               shot two policemen and their
               witness on a stakeout.
      Looks pass between the hobby cops.

               Ooh, look at that. It's a
               detective's shield! All gold and
               shiny. A smart fellah wouldn't
               fuck with somebody who had one of
               these in his pocket. So... Let's
               see. I guess that makes us

                             BURNETT
               Not.
      He shows his shield. Both hobby cops lower their guns,
      unsure about what's next. Burnett moves in.
                             BURNETT
               Now, some rent-a-cops have
               licenses to carry weapons,  where
               others do not. Which might   you
               be? You wouldn't happen to   have
               those permits handy, would  you?
      From the looks on the hobby cops' faces, Julie can see
      that they don't.
                             JULIE
               Guess we know the answer to that
               one.

               operation. That's why they
               called their company Desilu.
               Desi was first. Lucy second.
               Get it? Desi-Lu?

      Coral Gables stakeout. Julie's passed out and, once
      again, sleeping in the rear of the car. In the glow of
      the faltering streetlights and the approaching dawn,
      she couldn't look more beautiful. And from his post in
      the driver's seat, he's looking at her with a longing
      that goes well beyond lust. Then Burnett breaks the
      silence.
                                BURNETT
               Two o'clock.     The red Civic.

      Elliot exits the house in a hurry. Hair wet from a
      shower and fresh change of clothes. He fumbles with the
      keys to his Civic, gets in and drives.

                             JULIE

      Lowrey has the keys in the ignition and is stomping on
      the gas.

               Yeah. Tell Howard to assemble
               the troops. We just made the

      Typical pandemonium. Theresa is making/serving breakfast
      while the TV BLARES. Quincy is channel surfing on the
      TV when he comes up with the news footage of the
      explosion, followed by more footage of Lowrey, Julie, and
      Burnett at the scene.

               In our continuing report on police
               violence, the most recent incident
               involving two Miami P.D. officers
               remains unexplained by department
               spokesmen. This high-speed chase
               was captured two nights ago by
               our Live Copter 9 news team. And
               while the driver was killed, both
               police officers involved in the
               incident seemed to escape without
               injury.
                             THERESA
               Kids, you go over to the
               neighbors' house. I'll be right
               back.

      Theresa enters building, ignores Chet and heads straight
      for bank of elevators.
                             CHET
               Lady, all visitors must be
               announced.
                             THERESA
               Announce this!
      In a motherly flash, she's got Chet by the ear and she's
      dragging him over to the elevator. He yowls the whole
      way until he sticks his master pass-card in the elevator
      lock. Theresa lets  go.

      Julie is framed in the bedroom doorway, somewhat sadly
      watching Burnett and Lowrey scramble to get ready for
      the bust.

               So, I guess when you get back, it's
               gonna be over.
                             LOWREY
               That's the plan... So, Mike. Loan
               some of those ass kicking clothes.

      And there's Theresa. Julie's hip.

               Which one do you want?     The tall
               one or the short one?
                             THERESA
               Oh, I got plenty in me to kill 'em
               both. But it's the short one I'm

      She pushes past.

      Burnett's stripped to his pants and T-shirt. While
      Lowrey's down to his white boxer shorts. He's talking
      and wiping down his gun with a rag.

                Wait. I know why. Because you
                said you needed me. Jesus, who's

      Julie slams a fist into Lowrey's face. The elevator
      doors shut. Then Burnett comes hauling down the
      corridor with Theresa at his heels. He pounds the
      elevator button.

       Fouchet shoves Julie into a waiting car. All three bad
       guys pile in and the CAR PEELS RUBBER just as Lowrey
       makes the doorway. Lowrey doesn't stop. He doesn't
       even wait for traffic. In nothing but his underwear,
       he appears from the building, turns the corner out the
       door, launches into traffic like a shot, spinning off
       bumpers, chasing Fouchet's car on foot.

      Appears behind Lowrey. Lowrey waves him in another
      direction. Burnett hauls one way. Lowrey the other.

238   INT. BEAUTY SALON - DAY                                  238
      MUZAK. Old ladies getting their hair blued and curled
      when -- BANG! Fouchet and the gang enter. Curlers fly.
      Screams!


      LOWREY
      enters. He dives to the floor as Casper stops and FIRES.
      BULLETS RIP through the salon walls and mirrors. Lowrey
      ends up under an old lady's dress.

239   EXT. OCEAN BLVD. (SOUTH BEACH)                           239
      Exiting the beauty salon and stumbling through a
      crowded cafe runs Fouchet and the gang, mauling their
      way through tables and patrons. Lowrey, only moments
      behind, pushing his way through the same path.

                                                            103.
240   EXT. INTERSECTION                                          240
      Fouchet stops right in the middle. Picks the first
      car that's headed for him. Levels a GUN on a taxi cab
      and FIRES two quick rounds -- BAM BAM!! The driver of
      the car instantly slumps. Ferguson's seen this before.
      He's around to the driver's side of the car, pulling the
      dead man out and leaving him on the street. Casper and
      Fouchet shove Julie inside and they're off again.

241   EXT. INTERSECTION                                          241
      But here comes Burnett. Crossing traffic. He's got no
      gun. So he jumps aboard Fouchet's car just as it gets
      into gear. The WHEELS SPIN. The CAR LURCHES ahead.


242   INSIDE CAB                                                 242
      Ferguson aims his pistol upward. He's about to fire
      into the roof when Julie shoves him. GUNSHOTS RING
      out sideways.

243   EXT./INT. CAB                                              243
      BULLETS RIP to either side of Burnett. Then Fouchet
      stomps on the brake and Burnett tumbles forward and
      onto the pavement.

      CLOSE ON BURNETT
      He rolls, makes it to one knee.   But his other leg
      gives way.


      FOUCHET
      He sees his chance and GUNS the ENGINE. The cab barrels
      at Burnett, who's stuck in the middle of the boulevard,
      about to become instant roadkill.
      Then --

244   EXT. STREET                                                244
      From out of nowhere, here comes Lowrey. Dashing out
      across the boulevard and snatching his partner from the
      deadly grille of the cab.

      TAXI CAB
      hauls on by. Leaving Burnett and Lowrey in a heap of
      their own, both trying to catch their breath.
                               LOWREY
                 Don't ever say I wasn't there for
                 you.

245   EXT. MIAMI PD - MOTORPOOL - DAY                           245
      TAC teams and uniform cops swarm around their cars.
      All waiting as Burnett and Lowrey arrive in their
      unmarked car. Howard approaches.

                               HOWARD
                 It's about fuckin' time.
                               BURNETT
                 We lost the girl.
                               HOWARD
                 But you found the dope, right?
                 So let's go get it back.
      A bicycle BELL RINGS. Heads turn. And here comes a
      BOY on his bike, serpentining his way through the maze
      of cars and cops until he gets to Lowrey, Burnett, and
      Howard.
                               BOY
                 Which one of you's Lowrey?   I got
                 somethin' for him.
                               LOWREY
                 At least I'm me again.
                        (hand out)
                 I'm Lowrey.
      From his back pocket, the boy extracts a cellular flip
      PHONE. He hands it to Lowrey. He presses the power
      button and, almost instantly, it RINGS.
                                LOWREY
                         (presses send)
                 Yeah.   This is Lowrey.

246   INT. FREIGHTER - DOPE LAB - DAY                           246

      Fouchet is revealed at the other end of the cellular
      call.

               I have something for you to listen
               to.
      Fouchet lifts his PISTOL and FIRES a single shot.   BAM!
      INTERCUT WITH --

               chemist. Now, I have but four
               hours left to make my deal. Fuck
               with my timetable and the next
               bullet kills the girl.
      Julie is gagged and sitting on the floor, scared
      shitless.

249   EXT. MIAMI PD - MOTORPOOL - LOWREY                         249
      He's in a vice.    Duty or the girl.   Then --
                             LOWREY
               You twisted motherfucker...
                      (then...)

               kill you.

               The snitch who tipped us to the
               dope lab? Turns out to be a
               bogus address.
                             BURNETT
               Bogus address?

               How'd he know we were gearing up
               to go? It's like he's known all
               along where we're gonna be and
               when.

                             LOWREY
               You know that once he sells the
               dope, he's gonna kill her just
               like he did Max.
                             BURNETT
               Three little angels. Julie kept
               talking about his three little
               angels.
      A barkeeper appears with two beers.   Burnett automati-

               It was a birthday party... You
               know, after hours. Just the
               civilian staff... We were drinking.
               And everybody. They all had boy
               friends or their husbands.
                             LOWREY

               He was so nice to me. He said I
               was beautiful, too. I guess I
               wanted to believe him...
                      (then ashamed,
                       starting to shake)
               He took some horrible pictures of
               me. I don't remember any of it.
               I'd had too much to drink. I
               wondered if he'd drugged me.
               Later... he threatened to show
               them to my boys... my little
               angels. Said he'd pin the
               pictures up on the grade school
               bulletin boards for all their
               classmates to see if I didn't do
               what he wanted.

               could make the case. And then when
               the department gave the air
               conditioning to Mr. Orona...

               rips off drug dealers? A man
               like that ain't scared of nobody.
               Not the police. Not you guys.
               Nobody.

               Yeah. Yeah. I think that's it.

      The CAMERA ZEROES IN ON his cellular phone.    The power
      light is green.

               They're turning north onto the
               Orange Highway.
                             BURNETT
               We can make better time if we cut
               across the Biscayne Bridge.

263   EXT. BISCAYNE BRIDGE - DAY                                  263
      The van cuts across traffic, barely making the ramp which
      swirls up onto the bridge.

264   EXT. ORANGE COAST HIGHWAY NORTH - DAY                       264
      The dope convoy rolls OVER the CAMERA.

      AIRFIELD
      The trucks roll toward an old airport which consists of a
      small, pilot's terminal and four or so hangars spread out
      over the ten acre site.

      Two henchmen for the buyer open the yawning doors of this
      massive, five-story hangar to reveal a C-123 cargo
      aircraft. The convoy of trucks enters.

268   EXT. ORANGE HIGHWAY - DAY                                  268

      THROUGH a floor-mounted SPOTTING SCOPE we see the last of
      the trucks roll into Hangar 3 and two of the buyer's
      henchmen shut the doors.

                               BURNETT
                 That's it. That's where they're
                 making the deal.
      Burnett swivels the spotting scope.

      Fouchet shakes  hands with the BUYER. Upon which time one
      forklift begins  to drive pallets full of cash from the
      open cargo door  of the aircraft while another drives
      pallets full of  dope.

                               BUYER
                 Three hundred million and very,
                 very fresh. Too much to count,
                 eh?

                 Who's the bimbo?
                               FOUCHET
                 Simply part of another
                 transaction.

      The operation moves swiftly. Dope pallets for cash
      pallets. Smooth, just like the original heist. Two fuel
      trucks are moved in to gas up the aircraft.

272   EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY                                        272
      Rounding the corner from Hangar 3 -- here comes the
      garbage truck. CLOSER INSPECTION REVEALS Ruiz and
      Sanchez at the helm with both Lowrey and Burnett hanging
      from the sides. All of them wear dirty white jumpsuits
      and protective masks.

273   EXT. HANGAR 3 - DAY                                        273

      The two Buyer's henchmen stiffen at the sight of the
      oncoming truck. Their hands slip inside their coats to
      MP5-Ks slung under their armpits. But --

274   EXT. HANGAR 3 - GARBAGE TRUCK - DAY                        274
      It veers and swings over toward two nearby dumpsters.
      With Sanchez keeping a wary eye on the two bad guys and
      Ruiz to operate the hydraulics, Burnett and Lowrey drop
      from the truck and do their best working-for-the-city
      amble over to the dumpster. Business as usual. They
      wheel it over and position it in front of the two lifting
      forks where the garbage appears to be expertly lifted and
      dumped into the truck.

      CLOSE ON DUMPSTER
      As it lowers, the gearing seems to get hung up. The
      hydraulics' arms won't work, leaving the dumpster stuck
      in the air.

      RUIZ AND SANCHEZ
      Begin speaking Spanish, one blaming the other for this
      fiasco. Angry words. Finally, Ruiz has had enough.       He
      tosses down his gloves and hat and begins stomping off    as
      if he's just quit his stinking job. He's headed right     for
      the henchmen, his mouth moving and spewing and moving    and
      spewing. The henchmen look to each other, not knowing
      what to think. Ready for anything when --
      CLICK CLICK -- GUNS COCKING.
      Both Burnett and Lowrey are right behind the henchmen with
      guns at the base of their necks.

      The Buyer buckles himself into the pilot's seat of the C-
      123. His crew shuts the cargo hatches and he gives a
      pleased salute to Fouchet. The ENGINES TURN OVER and the
      propellers move. Meanwhile --

277   INT. HANGAR 3 - TRUCK ENGINES                              277
      START. Loaded with cash, they're ready to go.   Fouchet
      gives the signal to open the doors.

      CASPER AND FERGUSON
      Move to open the doors. They give a good shove.   Still
      nothing. So they bang and shout.
                            CASPER
               Hey! Wake up out there!     Open
               it up!

278   EXT. HANGAR 3 - DAY                                        278

      The garbage truck barrels through the rear wall,
      instantly colliding with the left wing section of
      aircraft. The wheel assembly buckles and the aircraft
      twists onto one wing. Fuel spills.

      Pop up Burnett and Lowrey. MP5-Ks in hand. They BLAZE
      the cargo doors and CUT DOWN the rest of the Buyer's
      henchmen.

      CASPER AND FERGUSON
      charge.   GUNS BLASTING.

      BULLETS

      RIP across the dumpster, moving up into the truck cab.
      Ruiz and Sanchez dive and roll to either side.
      Meanwhile, the sparks ignite the spilled fuel.
                              LOWREY
                Move it or lose it!
      Burnett and Lowrey climb from the dumpster and run.
      Casper and Ferguson have a clear shot. They level and
      aim, but...
      KUH-WHOOM!
      The FUEL TANK on the aircraft EXPLODES. The truck drivers
      dive for cover. Charging for the open hole in the wall.

               Remember us?
      The two bad guys turn with their guns. The flames
      igniting their already battered faces. But they don't
      turn fast enough. Both cops FIRE in unison. Ferguson
      and Casper fall. PULL BACK --


287   INT. HANGAR 3 - WIDE ANGLE                                   287

      and deeper into the hangar. The smoke is getting thicker
      and swirling with the burning cash.

290   INT. HANGAR 3 - BURNETT AND LOWREY                           290

      Appear Lowrey and Burnett. Twenty yards apart and
      closing. Guns carefully aimed. Fouchet pulls Julie
      close.

                              FOUCHET
                I was going to fuck her, then
                kill her. Now it looks like I'm
                only going to do the latter.
                              LOWREY
                Either we O.D. on the air or
                the whole place blows. We're
                dying anyway.
                              BURNETT
                Let her go and you'll walk. You
                can keep the dope and the money.
                       (coughs)
                Just the girl and we all get out
                of here.
                              FOUCHET
                What if I don't have the key.
                              JULIE
                He threw it in the --

                Shut up! It's gone. She's dead.
                Unless you move aside.
      Burnett eases further right. Gun carefully aimed. His
      eyes are stinging. Lowrey goes left. But he's lowering
      his gun.

      FOUCHET
      Pulls Julie closer. Gun at her head. Looking to
      Burnett. While Lowrey is nodding to Julie. Nodding

      They appear.   Alive and well. Big grins, helping Burnett
      to his feet.   Brushing him off.
                             BURNETT
               Hey, hey...
                      (then with a smile)
               Let's go get our jobs back.

      BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM                             119.
301   EXT. BURNETT HOUSE - DAY                                     301
      The front door opens and all the little Burnetts come
      screaming out...
                              BURNETT KIDS
                Daddy Daddy Daddy the hero!!!
      ... into the arms of their father.     He gathers them all
      into one big hug.
                                BURNETT
                Daddy's home!
      Behind Burnett appear Lowrey and Julie, arm in arm.
      The kids run to...

                              BURNETT KIDS
                Uncle Mike, Uncle Mike.
      Then...
                                BURNETT
                Baby!
      Theresa framed in the front doorway, looking smashing in
      the outfit Lowrey picked out for her. Burnett ambles up
      the walk into her arms. They hug and kiss, Theresa
      tossing a wink Lowrey's way.
                              LOWREY
                Manana, partner. Peace. Okay,
                kids. Pile in. And watch the
                leather and windows this time?
                              JULIE
                You got a real way with kids,
                Lowrey.

                              LOWREY
                You see anybody complaining?
                                BURNETT
                Hey.    Where are the kids goin'?
                              THERESA
                Didn't you know? We got us a new
                babysitter.
      She kisses him.
                                BURNETT
                You mean...
                              THERESA
                It's quality time, Marcus.
                                                    (CONTINUED)

301    CONTINUED:                                                 301
       Burnett shuts the door ON the CAMERA.    The screen GOES
       TO BLACK. Then UNDER CREDITS:

       Little Megan is on the potty.   She catches Lowrey as
       he passes.
                                MEGAN (V.O.)
                 Uncle Mike.   I did it!
