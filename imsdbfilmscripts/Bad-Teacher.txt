          starts removing the letters.

          INT. TEACHER'S LOUNGE - DAY

          POP! A Champagne cork hits the ceiling.
          TEACHERS who rarely get to drink at work, jockey for
          position, holding out their plastic flutes. (Note:
          female teachers outnumber male teachers 12:1.)
          PRINCIPAL WALLY SNUR, 40s, balding, faces the teachers.
          He has a habit of blinking hard before speaking.

          Well, it's been another great year here
          at JAMS. Who can forget Mr. Pinkus'
          haunted classroom? Sandy, thank you.
          SANDY PINKUS, 40s, sporting a ponytail, smiles, clearly
          enjoying the small compliment.

                         SANDY
          I ain't afraid of no ghost.
          The other teachers laugh.

          VOICE (O.C.)
          Wally, can I just say one quick thing?
          Wally turns to AMY SQUIRREL, late 20s, cute and
          wholesome. Any trace of sexuality she might have is
          wiped away by her adult pigtails. She treats students
          and adults alike -- like students.

                         AMY
          Just wanted to remind everyone the school
          day's not over. So let's keep the
          drinking under control, hmm? That's it.
          Back to you, Wally.
          A bunch of teacher roll their eyes.

          PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)
          But now as the summer is upon us, it's
          time to not only say goodbye to another
          school year, but to also say goodbye to a
          member of our faculty.

                         (BEAT)
          Elizabeth, can you come up here?
          ELIZABETH HALSEY, mid 20s, pretty and petite, walks up to
          the front. She sports an enormous diamond ring and dresses
          slightly more cosmopolitan than the other teachers.

          PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)
          You've only been with us for one short
          year, but know that you'll always be a
          part of the JAMS family.
          Elizabeth gives Principal Snur an appreciative smile.
          The Teachers lightly applaud.

          PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)
          And we got you a little something.
          Wally hands Elizabeth an envelope. She opens it and.
          pulls out a gift card: BOSTON MARKET. $37.

                         ELIZABETH
          Almost forty dollars. Thank you!

                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
          Why don't you say a couple words?

                         ELIZABETH
          Okay. Um... I'm not really good at this
          type of thing so I'll make it quick. I
          know I've only been here a year, but
          there's so much I'm going to miss...

          INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY

          Elizabeth sits at her desk, cleaning it out. She's tossing
          the few personal effects she has into a banker's box.

          ELIZABETH (V.0.)
          My students, probably most of all.I'm not
          saying they were little angels, butthey
          were all there to learn and that'sthe
          greatest gift a student can give a teacher.
          Elizabeth's class is horsing around, enjoying the last
          days of seventh grade.
          A dim-looking BOY tentatively approaches her desk with
          his yearbook in hand. He hands it to Elizabeth, who
          considers what to write for a beat, then smiles as she
          signs it.

          INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

          Elizabeth walks down the hall holding her box.
          SIXTH, SEVENTH and EIGHTH graders all race past her,
          running toward their summer vacation.

          ELIZABETH (V.0.)
          And I wish that I had gotten to know all of
          you better, but between four classes and
          planning a wedding, I had my hands full.
          From the little I do know about you, I know
          that our students are in good hands.
          Elizabeth passes Amy's classroom, where she is carefully
          removing inspirational posters from her walls and rolling
          them into cardboard tubes.

          EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY

          Three middle school BURNOUTS are smoking weed in a
          thicket on the outskirts of the school property.

          ELIZABETH (V.0.)
          And I can't believe it's all over. This
          year flew by. And even though I'll never
          teach again professionally, I've realized
          that I don't need a blackboard and
          classroom to set an example.
          Elizabeth comes up behind them.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Hand it over.
          The Burnouts' eyes all go wide and they freeze. One of
          the burnouts hands her the joint.

          The kids look at each other and then pull out a bag with
          a couple of joints. They hand it over to Elizabeth.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          This was a warning. Next time, I don't
          call the principal. I call the cops.

          EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - TEACHER PARKING LOT - DAY

          Elizabeth walks to her brand new MERCEDES. She gets in,
          pulls out a joint and lights it. She takes a huge TOKE,
          and then PEELS out of the lot. She tosses her banker's
          box out the window and extends her hand, giving the
          school THE FINGER.

          ELIZABETH (O.S.)
          Woo-hoo!
          A couple students look at her strangely.

                         ANGLE ON
          The dim-looking kid that had Elizabeth sign his yearbook.
          He flips to the faculty section, and by the picture of
          Elizabeth is her message: "YOU ARE ILLITERATE!"

          (struggling to read)
          You are... Illit... Illit...
          Elizabeth's car comes barrelling toward him and nearly
          hits him.
          She accelerates into the speed bumps, almost hitting the
          JANITOR from the opening shot, who's changing the plastic
          letters to read, "HAVE A GREAT SUMMER!"

          A Mercedes with the vanity plate "HIS" is parked in the
          driveway of an upscale neighborhood. Elizabeth's matching
          Mercedes pulls into the adjacent spot. Her license plate
          reads "HERS."

          MARK, early 30s, exits the bedroom in his underwear.
          He's shaved his head to avoid signs of early balding and
          is also a full four inches shorter than Elizabeth.
          Thankfully for him, he has money.

          him a glass.

          Yeah. You should have seen it. What a

          She raises her glass for a toast. He raises his.

          night in "anal alley." Hmm?
          Something drops in the bedroom. Mark, alarmed, turns
          towards the door. Elizabeth brushes past him into --

          See? Nothing.
          Just then, the wooden chest at the foot of the bed SNEEZES.
          Elizabeth opens the latch to find SHEILA, 23, dressed only
          in a thong, scrunched in the fetal position. She stands,
          revealing LARGE FAKE BREASTS, and steps out of the chest.

          reads from a stack of US Weekly's and circles pictures of
          CELEBRITY BREASTS. LYNN, late 30s, the kind of woman who
          spends a lot of time on her internet dating profiles, but

          Elizabeth and Lynn sit at an outdoor table. Lynn picks at
          a garden salad. Elizabeth is eating a bucket of chicken
          and drinking a large drink. She pulls a bottle of cough
          syrup from her purse and dumps it into her drink.

          I spent most of my summer hanging out at
          the bars near where the Bulls practice.
          Had some fun, got some cool souvenirs that
          I Ebayed, but those guys aren't looking to
          settle down. And they all wear condoms.
          And then they take the condoms with them.
          That's how paranoid they are that a girl
          will try and get pregnant. Like it's so
          easy to get pregnant from a guy nutting
          into a condom.

          day, but we're doing something new this
          year. It's very exciting. We're
          splitting the cafeteria into quadrants.
          Elizabeth yawns.

          So, anyways, in order for the quadrant
          system to work, it's vital that each
          teacher maintain order within their
          quadrant. Because it's really tough for
          me as head lunch monitor -- or another
          teacher -- to leave their quadrant to
          discipline a kid in another quadrant. I
          know it's a lot to take in. I'd be happy
          to sit with-you after school and explain
          all of the new guidelines.

          Fair enough. Listen, I don't want to

          it might be fun to do some ice-breakers.

          The carwash is wrapping up. Elizabeth counts money at a
          makeshift table and puts the earnings into a metal
          lockbox. She glances around and then shoves a large
          clump of cash into her DAISY DUKES.

          This'll just take a sec. I thought you
          might want to know that Elizabeth Halsey
          showed up at the carwash in a bikini top and
          short-shorts. It was pretty racy stuff.

          hesitates and then goes into an adjoining stall.

                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
          Look, Josh Gershman's dad called and said
          that the carwash was a huge success. And
          Lauren Rissman's dad called and said the
          kids had a great time.

                         AMY
          I don't want to speak out of school, but
          I happened to be pedalling by and saw her
          get.pretty chummy with the money. ,And
          remember, we barely know anything about
          her. She was a real lone wolf last year.

          from the seventh grade car wash?

          Well, they raised over $7000, so whatever
          she did worked. And next time you accuse
          a fellow teacher of stealing, you better
          be damn sure. We're done here.
          Amy takes a deep breath. Her face is BEET RED.

          Thanks for the pep talk. Have a super

          Elizabeth is up front. She's staring,at the PARENTS.
          They stare right back at her. It's awkwardly silent for
          a beat too long.

                         ELIZABETH
          Hi, my name's Elizabeth Halsey.
          Soooooo... Any questions?
          Sasha's Mother eagerly raises her hand. Elizabeth points
          to her.

                         SASHA'S MOTHER
          Hi, I'm Sasha's mother. We waved to each
          other at the carwash. I'm a little
          concerned with the importance you're
          placing on movies. What about the state
          test?
          Elizabeth points to her sign on the wall -- "Don't
          Question My Authority."

                         ELIZABETH
          That's exactly what I say to my students.
          Listen, I'm a good teacher. And the school
          hired me because I'm good at what I do.
          (as the parents take this in)
          And the reason your son loves my class is
          because I inspire him. Movies are one
          tool that I use. I also use other
          multimedia techniques, which I'm not
          going to get into right now. Look, I
          could take you day by day through my
          entire syllabus, but that's not how I do
          things. I'm not one of these stuffy
          teachers who's totally by the book. I
          talk to the kids like they're little
          adults. It's about mutual respect. So
          that's my spiel, as the Jews say.

          Keep reading.
          Elizabeth takes her seat and leans under her desk,
          obscuring her from her class. She opens her pocketbook
          and pulls out a CIGARETTE CASE. She pops it open and we
          SEE three neatly rolled JOINTS.
          Without hesitation, Elizabeth POPS the first one into her
          mouth and starts chewing vigorously. As she. makes her
          way through the second and then the third, the chewing
          becomes slower and the BARKING becomes louder and louder.
          Elizabeth starts CHOKING as the door opens and the Police
          Officer and the German Shepherd enter, followed by
          Principal Snur and Amy.

                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
          Elizabeth, sorry to bother you. This
          will only take a second.
          Elizabeth,. still choking, digs into her purse. She grabs
          her cough syrup and takes a huge swig. Elizabeth wipes
          her mouth, breathes normally.

                         ELIZABETH
          Sorry. I had something caught in my
          throat.
          The German Shepherd continues barking.

                         POLICE OFFICER #1
          What is it, Axel? Where is it, boy?
          The Dog comes bounding at Elizabeth. Elizabeth's eyes go
          wide. Amy licks her lips. The Dog sideswipes Elizabeth,
          almost knocking her over, and jumps onto Garrett.

                         GARRETT
          Ahhh!!!
          The'Police Officer starts rummaging through Garrett's bag
          and pulls out an opened bag of CORN CHIPS.

                         POLICE OFFICER #1
          (holding up Corn Chips)
          All clear. Dog must've responded to
          these. Happens.
          Elizabeth glares at Amy -- "I know you were behind this."
          Amy glares back.
          Principal Snur looks at Amy and shakes his head.

          is still contraband. That's detention,
          Buster.

                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
          Enough, Amy. I think it's time we call
          off this witch-hunt.

                         ELIZABETH
          (pointedly to Amy)
          Thank you, Principal Snur. Now if you'll
          excuse me, my class has a state test to
          prepare for.
          Principal Snur, Amy and the Police Officer exit.
          Elizabeth slumps down into her chair, and all at once,
          the combination of WEED and COUGH SYRUP HITS HER.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Whoa.

                         CHASE

          Elizabeth takes a long beat before answering.

          Class dismissed.

          Get out of my face.
          (then, to Garrett)
          And leave the corn chips.
          The class uncertainly gathers their things and heads out.
          From outside Elizabeth's window, we SEE the SCHOOL BUSSES
          idling curbside. Elizabeth stares at the papers she
          still needs to grade. The papers stare back at her.

          Elizabeth is asleep at her desk. She wakes with a jolt.
          A paper is stuck to her face.
          She looks again at the stack of work, then at the pile of
          things she's already corrected. There's FOUR.

                         ELIZABETH
          Balls!
          She knocks the stack of ungraded papers to the ground.
          After a beat, she collects herself, goes to pick the,
          papers off the floor. As she starts tossing them into
          the trash, something catches her eye: a PRACTICE TEST
          MANUAL. And in the corner, an address:

                         54 LAKEVIEW STREET
          Peoria Il, 61602

                          ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

          Elizabeth tears off the corner and pockets it.

          I/E. ELIZABETH'S CAR - DAY
          Elizabeth is driving down the highway and smoking a joint.

          ELIZABETH (V.0.)
          Unfortunately, I can't make it in today.
          My grandmother took a turn for the worse
          and it looks like she's dead.

          INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY

          The kids are laughing and engaged. TURN TO REVEAL SCOTT,
          dressed in overalls and a straw hat with a piece of hay
          in his mouth, animatedly teaching. He's holding a copy
          of "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer."

          ELIZABETH (V.0.)
          Yeah. So I'm off to the funeral. Wish

          Elizabeth knocks on the door. A buff, shirtless guy in a
          backwards hat opens it. He likes what he sees.

                         FRAT GUY
          Hi there.

                         ELIZABETH

          Yeah, hold on. T-baaaaag! Someone's
          here.
          (then, back to Elizabeth)
          So you coming to our "CEOs and Corporate
          Ho's" party tonight?
          Elizabeth just stares at the Frat Guy. He turns away.
          Tucker, dressed identically to the Frat Guy but twenty
          pounds overweight, hustles down the stairs. He has a
          tattoo of intertwined teabags around his bicep.

          INT. SIGMA NU - TUCKER'S BEDROOM - DAY

          Tucker sits on his bed. Elizabeth leans against a desk,
          unwilling to sit down on anything in his disgusting room.
          BOB MARLEY plays softly.

                         TUCKER
          Do you ever talk to my brother?

                         ELIZABETH
          No. He dumped me, remember?

                         TUCKER
          You and my brother always had the
          histrionics.

          So, do you want to come to our party

          We're kinda light on Ho's.

          Two things. Number one: who do you think
          I am? Yeah, I like to party and yeah,
          I'm in an awesome frat, but that really
          hurts. And two: they're not "date rape"
          drugs. It's called GHB -- and it's for
          weightlifting. It helps build mass,
          okay? Why do you even want it?

                         ELIZABETH

                         (DEADPAN)

          I have money and I'm in a rush.
          She takes out a wad of cash.

                         TUCKER
          That's all you needed to say. No need to
          get all histrionic on me.
          Tucker walks over to a chest, opens it, and takes out a
          small lockbox. He unlocks it and takes out a small
          bottle containing a clear liquid.

                         TUCKER (CONT'D)
          One capful makes you feel really good.
          Two capfuls will knock her out for a
          couple hours. You don't want to take any
          more than two.
          Elizabeth hands him some cash. He hands her the jar and
          then gives her a big, warm hug.

                         TUCKER (CONT'D)
          Listen, I know you and my brother aren't
          together anymore, but I still think of
          you as a sister, okay?

          Get your hand off my ass.

          Marjorie?
          "Marjorie" turns and we SEE that it's actually ELIZABETH,

          an attractive woman. Elizabeth stands and extends her
          hand. Carl notices Elizabeth's very short skirt.

          Look, Marjorie, I know my tests aren't
          perfect. But what's the alternative? I'm
          all for free thinking and creativity, but
          how do you formulate an education budget
          without hard numbers from one of my tests?

          You don't need to convince me. But you
          know what would help, Carl? For me to
          see one of this year's tests.

                         CARL
          No problem at all.

          A LUXURY BUS idles curbside. Parents see off their kids.
          Scott and Elizabeth are checking kids in. Principal Snur
          walks up.

                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
          She'll be fine. But to be honest, I
          think she was scaring some of the kids.

                         ELIZABETH
          I bet, I bet. Well, let her know she's
          in my thoughts.

          Amy watching from outside her car. One side of her face
          is completely blistered, scaly and red from the POISON
          IVY. The kids have every reason to be scared by her.

          A splotchy-faced Amy trudges down the hallway. She
          passes Elizabeth's room, stops, walks back to the door
          and peers in. She looks down the hallway -- it's empty.

          Amy rifles through Elizabeth's desk. She opens the top

          floor, where she has neat stacks of what used to be in
          her desk. She finds her test booklet and compares the

          Abraham Lincoln always showed great

          the second grade and you wet your bed and
          you were so embarrassed and you made me
          promise not to ever tell anyone. Well, I

          Garrett walks up to a drab building where he sees
          Elizabeth on the curb waiting for him. There's a tiny
          sign that reads "Office of the Poet Laureate."

          It's closed. Won't be open till morning.
          Come on. Let's get back to the hotel.
          I'm sure everyone's mad at you.
          Garrett stands his ground.

          I'm not leaving without talking to the
          poet laureate.

          Do you think that some Shel Silverstein
          wannabe is going to tell you the meaning
          of life?

          Not for long. I'm getting fired for
          cheating as soon as we get back.
          Garrett takes a seat next to Elizabeth.

                         GARRETT
          So. you came looking for me on your own?

          as you possibly can. Get her out of your
          head.

                         GARRETT
          They'll probably reject me, too.

                         ELIZABETH
          Yeah, probably. But life's about how you
          deal with rejection. You can either hide
          in a corner and cry or you can get
          stronger every time. And I figure a kid
          like you with not much going for him --
          if he were to choose the latter -- might
          end up becoming a pretty strong man.

          freezing and Mr. Delacourte's probably
          shitting a brick.

                         GARRETT
          I can't go back there. All the kids will
          laugh at me.

                         ELIZABETH
          You seriously think they haven't been
          laughing already?

                         GARRETT
          Maybe Chase is wondering where I am.

                         ELIZABETH
          Hate to break it to you, kid, but I don't
          think anyone gives two shits where we are.

          Don't answer right now. Let it marinate.
          Oh, and I should mention that if this
          goes to trial, I can cry on cue.
          Elizabeth starts crying. Everybody looks at her, aghast.
          And as quickly she started, she stops.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Now, if you'll all excuse me, I should be
          heading to fifth period. I hate to be
          tardy.

          INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY

          Elizabeth heads down the empty hallway. From the auditorium,
          the faint sound of "Tomorrow, Tomorrow" from "Annie" can be
          heard.
          Amy steps out of the auditorium, humming along to the song.
          She notices Elizabeth coming to her. Amy debates her options.

                         AMY
          Elizabeth! I was so worried. You gave
          us quite a scare, you did.
          Elizabeth doesn't acknowledge her and continues walking
          toward Amy, only feet away now.

                         AMY (CONT'D)
          (attempting some levity)
          Somebody's being a grumple--
          BAM! Elizabeth punches Amy square in the nose. Amy drops
          to her knees and grabs her nose, now squirting blood.

                         AMY (CONT'D)
          Elizabeth keeps walking and turns a corner. A BELL RINGS
          and the hallway starts filling with STUDENTS.

          QUICK CUTS. The year is winding down. Instead of gym,
          kids are using the time to sign each other's yearbooks.
          Chase walks up to Garrett with her yearbook, asks him to
          sign it.

          PRINCIPAL SNUR (V.0.)
          Who can forget the exciting addition of a
          climbing wall to the small gym...

          QUICK CUTS. It's class photo day. With each FLASH, we
          SEE a different TEACHER with a different CLASS.
          And finally AMY, with a bandage over her nose and two
          black eyes, smiles widely alongside her CLASS.

          .Or the student/teacher spelling bee.

          INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - TEACHER'S LOUNGE - DAY

          Much like the first scene of the movie. The teachers are
          sipping plastic flutes of Champagne. Principal Snur is
          up front. Elizabeth lingers in the back.

                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
          I think that was a huge s-u-c-c-a-s-s.
          Polite laughter.

          PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)
          But seriously... With summer around the
          corner, it's time to not only say goodbye
          to another school year, but to also say
          goodbye to one of our own.
          Elizabeth smiles.

          PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)
          Amy Squirrel.
          Amy, her face completely healed, steps forward, with a
          pursed smile.

          PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)
          After six short years of outstanding,
          tireless work here, Amy is transferring
          out of the district.

          Although leaving was a difficult
          choice...
          Amy looks over to Elizabeth, who motions for her to
          continue.

                         AMY (CONT'D)
          When the superintendent personally asks
          you to work at one of the worst schools
          in the state, you say yes. I'm looking
          forward to bringing my brand of zany
          energy and lust -- not love, lust -- for
          learning to the underprivileged students
          at Malcolm X High. I welcome the
          challenge.
          The Teachers applaud, Scott the most enthusiastic.
          Elizabeth steps up to Amy, who flinches.

                         ELIZABETH
          Here, I got you this.
          Elizabeth hands Amy a poster tube. She.opens it and
          unravels the "Integrity" poster that Elizabeth stole.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          And good luck. Somebody's gonna need it.
          Elizabeth heads for the door. Scott catches up to her.

          Hey, Stranger.

          maybe the two of us could go grab a

          Elizabeth's 1994 Grand-Am pulls into her spot. And as
           her bare leg steps out of the car, we

          INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

          and as she reaches for the door to her class, we

          INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY

          Quick cuts. From behind, we see Elizabeth place an APPLE
          on each desk, just as Amy did earlier.
          Elizabeth's walls are still bare, except for a framed
          photo of Amy's class picture, with Amy's messed up face,
          from the year before.
          The bell RINGS.
          Elizabeth turns and we now SEE that she has TASTEFUL FAKE

          BREASTS.
          Elizabeth walks to her door and opens it, watching the
          students as they reconnect with friends and share stories
          about summer camp.
          She notices Sasha who is MASSAGING a BOY's shoulders.
          bunch of other EIGHTH GRADE BOYS wait their turn.

          EIGHTH GRADE BOY
          Do me! Do me!
          Sasha clearly enjoys the attention. Elizabeth smiles.
          Garrett walks by, hand in hand with Chase. Trailing both
          of them are identical rolling backpacks. He sees
          Elizabeth and runs over.
