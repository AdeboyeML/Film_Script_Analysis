               FADE IN:

               EXT. DESERT -- DAY

               The white sun beats down on the rocky terrain. There's not a 
               cloud in the blue sky and the wind is at a standstill.

               Far in the distance, a MEDIUM SIZED FLAT-BED TRUCK makes its 
               way to the entrance of a large cavern opening. Two VULTURES 
               perched on a barren tree watch the intruders.

               EXT. DESERT -- DAY

               The truck screeches to a dusty stop. Three men in matching 
               coveralls and hard hats jump from the cab: CHIEF (42, stocky, 
               weary), LANKY (32, withered) and COLLEGE BOY (23, clean cut 
               and naive).

               Chief holds a map and glares into the howling black mouth 
               before them.

                                     CHIEF
                         This is it.

                                     LANKY
                         Why did it have to be these caves...

                                     COLLEGE BOY
                         Is something wrong?

                                     LANKY
                              (to College Boy)
                         Don't mind me, buddy. It's nothin'.

               Chief grabs a flashlight and moves to the back of the truck.

               The logo on the rear gate reads "WIGWAM WASTE MANAGEMENT." 

                                     CHIEF
                         Let's get that first barrel.

               The gate drops revealing their full load of YELLOW BARRELS 
               bearing the familiar BIOHAZARD WASTE symbol.

               INT. CAVERN -- MOMENTS LATER

               College Boy and Lanky steer a cart loaded with the first 
               barrel inside. Chief's lone beam of light leads the men.

                                     COLLEGE BOY
                         What's with the awkward silence?

                                     LANKY
                         You don't know?

               College Boy shakes his head "no" and they set the cart down.

                                     CHIEF
                         Last winter, a man kidnapped a little 
                         girl and holed up in one of these 
                         caves. The cops had him pinned down 
                         and began to move in. This guy started 
                         shooting... but he wasn't aiming at 
                         the officers...
                              (getting closer)
                         ...he was firing at something inside.

               College Boy is rapt.

                                     CHIEF
                         When the dust cleared, all they found 
                         was the little girl's shoes.
                              (beat)
                         With the feet still in 'em.

               Something GRABS College Boy's ankles, causing him to jump.

                                     COLLEGE BOY
                         Ahh!!!

               Lanky's on his knees, having grabbed him from behind. The 
               two men mockingly laugh. College boy settles, embarrassed.

                                     COLLEGE BOY
                         Assholes.

                                     CHIEF
                         Hey, relax, I nearly shit myself 
                         when my boss pulled that one on me.

                                     LANKY
                         I went well beyond nearly.

               Then, a sound. All eyes turn.

                                     CHIEF
                         What was that?

                                     COLLEGE BOY
                         Once was plenty, fellas.

                                     CHIEF
                         Shhhh...

               As Chief moves forward, pulling out his pick-axe.

               Instantly, the cave is illuminated by a white floodlight. A 
               group of GREENPEACE HIPPIE ACTIVISTS stand in the cave, 
               CHAINED TOGETHER at the waist, startling the men into screams.

               MEAN GREEN (35, crooked glasses on a face that has launched 
               a thousand craps) barks into a MINI BULLHORN that hangs around 
               her neck. She charges towards Chief.

                                     MEAN GREEN
                         Stop it right there! You will not 
                         rape Mother Nature one more day!

               Panicked, Chief drops his pick-axe and stumbles back.

                                     CHIEF
                         Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

               In unison, the hippies start CHANTING.

                                     HIPPIE GROUP
                         Mother Nature is not a whore/Don't 
                         dump in her any-more/Mother Nature 
                         is not a whore/Don't dump in her any-
                         more...

               A BEARDED CAMERAMAN with a huge KEY RING on his belt, films 
               the whole event. The three men are stopped in their tracks.  

                                     CHIEF
                         Take it easy! We have a permit!

                                     MEAN GREEN
                              (handing a document)
                         And we have an injunction from the 
                         State to prevent any dumping in these 
                         caverns! This is virgin land! The 
                         aqueducts in these caves bring 
                         drinking water to our families, and 
                         its piping provides drainage for our 
                         farms that enrich this barren land! 
                         And it won't be tainted by waste of 
                         any kind! Not now! Not ever!

               Chief, shaken, confirms the injunction and hands it back.

                                     CHIEF
                         Fine, just back off!

               He snaps his fingers, motioning to the barrel.

                                     CHIEF
                         Let's roll... Now-now-now!

               Backing away, looking to Mean Green.

                                     CHIEF
                         How do you guys always know where 
                         we're going?

                                     MEAN GREEN
                              (with a smirk)
                         I'll tell ya next time! NOW MOVE IT!

               Hastily, the men roll the barrel out of the cave.

                                     MEAN GREEN
                         Score one for the green team!!!

               The hippies let out a spirited cheer. One pulls out a 
               tambourine, drums the beat for KUM BI YA. The rest join in 
               the victorious chant as they watch the three men hop in their 
               truck and peel away.

                                     BEARDED CAMERAMAN
                         Hey, man, that was righteous, but I 
                         need a shot with the sign up.

               At the end of the human chain, an earthy woman, FUZZY, moves 
               to hang a GREENPEACE sign. Mean Green strokes the cave wall.

                                     MEAN GREEN
                         We saved you today, ol' gal.

               Fuzzy hammers the sign in, but hits too hard, causing a breach 
               in the rock wall.

                                     FUZZY
                         Oh, fuck!

                                     MEAN GREEN
                         Sister, why do you always swing for 
                         the fences?

                                     FUZZY
                              (eyeing breach)
                         It's okay, but I... I think I see 
                         something in there... something shiny.

               Fuzzy puts her face up to the hole for a closer look. The 
               rest of the hippie-chain moves in closer.

                                     FUZZY
                         Oh my, it looks like diamonds!

               CHOMP! A set of giant, ravenous teeth bite into Fuzzy's skull. 
               Blood SPLATTERS on the hippies.

               Bearded Cameraman jumps to pull Fuzzy from the breach.

               Fuzzy's body is YANKED into the hole. The group tumbles 
               forward.

               Mean Green tries to stop herself from sliding, but can't.

               One by one, the hippies are being dragged to their death.

               Ripping, tearing, and howling echoes off the walls.

               Bearded Cameraman stumbles back. Mean Green spots him.

                                     MEAN GREEN
                         Give me the keys!!!

               Bearded Camerman just stares at her in shock. He's missing 
               both his arms.

               Mean Green lunges and grabs Chief's dropped pick-axe. She 
               HAMMERS at the chain around her waist.

               Foot by foot, she's dragged closer. At the last second, she 
               BREAKS the chain, popping herself free.

               She spins, running for safety. A guttural HOWL behind her 
               fills the cavern. Mean Green sprints toward the cave opening. 
               She's gonna make it. Only a few more feet. And then... JERK!

               Something grabs her neck and YANKS her back into the darkness. 
               The whiplash sends her bloody BULLHORN flying into the light. 
               As it lands, it lets out one last weak HONK...

                                                              CUT TO BLACK:

               P.O.V. - We frantically EMERGE from the burning wreck... 
               RUN from the crash over desolate prairie land...

               EXT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Neon light flashes UNITED NATIONS TAVERN. Laughing and music 
               emanates. Besides the bar, there's nothing around for miles.

               A 1985, pristine black Pontiac Trans-Am with a Golden Eagle 
               on the hood pulls up. The rear bumper sticker reads "MY OTHER 
               TOY HAS TITS."

               A weasel-like man with a fat belly and tank-top emerges from 
               the hot rod carrying a VELVET POOL CUE CASE. Freeze on him.

               OCCUPATION: TOWN JACKASS 
               LIFE EXPECTANCY: DEAD BY DAWN

               The rest of the parking lot is scattered with cars and pickup 
               trucks. Bozo lazily makes his way to the bar and pushes 
               through the front entrance --

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Bozo passes a man dressed in a cheap suit and standing well 
               over six foot five with frazzled black hair and olive skin.

               Talking with a thick Greek accent, he pleads into a pay phone.

                         cell... And to top it off, my car 
                         crapped out on the side of the road! 
                         I'm not making the conference and I 
                         have fourteen leads waiting for me. 
                         You gotta help me out here. I'm not

                         In with anger, out with love.

               Further into the bar, a man in a wheelchair loads a quarter 
               into an old jukebox, but he is instantly pushed away by Bozo.

               Freeze on him.

                         Shut up, fag.

               Bozo punches in his selection. EDGY CAT (34, samurai pony 
               tail, don't you dare call him an alcoholic) stands by the 
               bar's POOL TABLE powdering his cue.

                                     EDGY CAT
                              (to Bozo)
                         You're late!

                                     BOZO
                         Don't dilly-dally then. Rack 'em!

               The CD spins and an 1980s heavy metal classic KICKS IN.

               Bozo, mouthing the lyrics, struts away.

               NOTE: Music plays over all the bar sequences.

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT

               P.O.V. - We continue to run. Rapid breathing.

               Beer Guy (kinda handsome... just kinda) sets a keg of beer 
               behind the bar. Freeze on him.

               NAME: BEER GUY 
               AGE: 32 
               OCCUPATION: BEER GUY/PART-TIME HOST AT RED LOBSTER 
               LIFE EXPECTANCY: WIMPS AND DORKS ARE THE FIRST TO GO... HE'S 
               BOTH

               He talks with BARTENDER (thinning hair, chiseled face, big 
               earring) who preps a drink.

                                     BEER GUY
                         I mean, we'd been together for so 
                         long and then... bang! She drops me. 
                         Since then, it's been like a damn 
                         country song: she's gone, the car's 
                         repossessed, and a father figure 
                         made a pass at me. I'm not saying I 
                         ever had it. But I have definitely 
                         lost it.
                              (beat)
                         Now I haul this swill from armpit to 
                         armpit. I used to be a model for 
                         Christ's sake.

               Coach has been eavesdropping on Beer Guy and approaches.

                                     COACH
                         For what, may I ask?

                                     BEER GUY
                         JC Penny. Spring wear.

               Beer Guy then mimics throwing a sport coat over his shoulder 
               and delivering his "model" cheese smile.

                                     COACH
                         You know, Chach, catching you at 
                         this low point is pure serendipity.

                                     BEER GUY
                         Why is that?

                                     COACH
                         Because I take the rubble of man and 
                         build superstars. In my briefcase 
                         here is a doorway to a self-help 
                         sensation. Give me a minute, because 
                         I'd like to buy you a drink and change 
                         your life forever. I have a brochure --

                                     BARTENDER
                         Save it. We don't deal in pamphlets 
                         'round here. We stick to chemistry. 
                         And his drinks are on me.

               Bartender puts a shot in front of Beer Guy. Behind him, a 
               mounted DEER HEAD is prominently displayed. Freeze on him.

               NAME: BARTENDER 
               AGE: 50 
               OCCUPATION: BARTENDER 
               FUN FACT: SHOT 4 TIMES, STABBED 6 TIMES, BIT BY 1 SQUIRREL 
               LIFE EXPECTANCY: READY TO WEAR

               With Coach stumped, Bartender turns to Beer Guy.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Was that the last keg?

                                     BEER GUY
                         Yup, one keg of Beast for the 
                         basement, then the truck's dry.

                                     BARTENDER
                         If you're stayin', move the truck, 
                         boss gets pissed about you using 
                         primo parking.

               Beer Guy downs his shot and hoists the lone keg into the 
               waiting keg elevator.

                                     BEER GUY
                         Right, 'cause this joint's hopping.

               He hits a button and the keg slowly lowers to the basement.

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT

               P.O.V. - We jump over a bush and crash in the dusty earth.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               A glass of beer slides down the bar. A hand GRABS it and 
               puts it on a tray. The woman is pretty though haggard, stained 
               apron and dirty blond hair. Freeze on her.

               NAME: TUFFY 
               AGE: 25 
               OCCUPATION: CAREER WAITRESS

               DUMPING OF MANURE... IN EX-HUSBAND'S CAR 
               LIFE EXPECTANCY: BADASS-IN-WAITING

               Tuffy carries the tray toward a table. She passes a TV mounted 
               on the wall.

               ON TV: A NEWSCASTER, dressed in a coat and tie, talks.

                                     NEWSCASTER
                         ...the search for the missing 
                         protesters will be further complicated 
                         by the unstable conditions of these 
                         deep tunnels. Thus far, no sign of 
                         life has been detected, yet town 
                         officials are still optimistic.

               Newscaster spins and an ECLIPSE GRAPHIC appears on screen.

                                     NEWSCASTER
                         On a brighter note, or should I say 
                         a darker note, tomorrow's solar 
                         eclipse will bring out adults and 
                         children alike for a citywide fair 
                         of this metrological event. Stay 
                         tuned for our man on the street to 
                         take a closer look...

               INT. BAR -- BASEMENT -- NIGHT

               Beer Guy pulls the keg from the elevator and places it next 
               to other kegs. A faint conversation brews behind a curtain. 
               BOSS MAN (paunchy, sweaty, ugly) and ROADIE (English accent, 
               light hair, leather skin, thin build) talk shop.

                                     BOSS MAN (O.S.)
                         Listen, bud. I got a load ready to 
                         move and your man's not here.

                                     ROADIE (O.S.)
                         He's coming. Relax. And if he doesn't 
                         show --

                                     BOSS MAN (O.S.)
                         We got a problem.

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT

               P.O.V. - We are trucking... labored breathing...

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Tuffy moves to a table where ADULTERER (bushy mustache, 
               sweater vest, dress shirt) sits with TRAMPY (designer glasses, 
               hair pulled back, tight blue business suit, closet tramp). 

               Freeze on Trampy.

               NAME: TRAMPY 
               AGE: 19 
               OCCUPATION: BANK TELLER 
               MOTTO: THE SHORTER THE SKIRT, THE HIGHER THE RAISE 
               LIFE EXPECTANCY: BETTER THAN ADULTERER

                                     TRAMPY
                         He said there was no reason I had to 
                         stay a teller and that if I did good 
                         work and didn't mess up, I could 
                         become an assistant manager within 
                         three years.
                              (pause)
                         Can you believe that?

                                     ADULTERER
                         That sounds great.

               Freeze on him.

               NAME: ADULTERER 
               AGE: 36

               GENITALS: SHAVED 
               LIFE EXPECTANCY: WORSE THAN TRAMPY

               Adulterer reaches into his pocket to pay the tab, but he 
               inadvertently pulls out his hidden WEDDING RING.

                                     TRAMPY
                         That sounds like bullshit! I could 
                         be an assistant manager at The Lake 
                         Arrowhead Casino for knowing the 
                         fuckin' alphabet to G! I'll be twenty 
                         in three months...

               The damning wedding band falls and bounces. As it rolls, 
               Tuffy, Trampy and Adulterer watch.

               The ring stops, standing still on its side.

               Trampy seethes as she chooses which obscenity to deliver.

               Adulterer slides a wad of cash to Tuffy.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Just bring the whole bottle.

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT

               P.O.V. - Sprinting and wheezing. The bar lights are ahead.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Tuffy walks back over to the bar adding Adulterer's cash to 
               a fat roll of money. BELLE (stringy blond hair, cute face, 
               brand-spanking new employee) looks up with surprise.

               Freeze on her.

               NAME: BELLE 
               AGE: 21 
               OCCUPATION: WAITRESS 
               GOAL: PLAY BELLE IN STAGE VERSION OF "BEAUTY AND THE BEAST"  
               LIFE EXPECTANCY: SAME ODDS AS PLAYING BELLE IN STAGE VERSION 
               OF "BEAUTY AND THE BEAST"

                                     BELLE
                         If I could made that kind of money, 
                         I'd be in Hollywood next week.

               Boss Man walks by and nods to Tuffy, making his way to the 
               rickety side-staircase to the SECOND FLOOR. Tuffy grinds her 
               teeth and moves to the staircase.

                                     TUFFY
                         'Round here, there are ways.

               Boss Man winks at Belle. Pure sleaze.

               Freeze on him.

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT

               P.O.V. - Running, approaching the distant bar...

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Bozo looks grimly at a pile of CASH on the ledge of the pool 
               table. Edgy Cat sinks the eighth shot of a NINE BALL game.

                                     EDGY CAT
                         That cash is gonna look much better 
                         in my pocket.

                                     BOZO
                              (re: mounted head)
                         Ya know, that deer only looks scared 
                         when you're in the room.

               Para rolls up behind Edgy.

                                     PARA
                         Excuse me, please.

                                     EDGY CAT
                         Jesus!

               Edgy looks to Para, distracted. Bozo quickly replaces the 
               WHITE CUE BALL with one hidden in his waistline.

               EXT. BAR -- NIGHT

               P.O.V. - The bar's a quarter mile away.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Para's chair back aims at the pool table pocket of which 
               Edgy Cat is lining up for the winning shot.

                                     EDGY CAT
                         That's all she wrote...

               SMACK! The nine ball sinks in the pocket, the cue ball 
               ricochets away as intended.

               Para flips a switch under his wheelchair's arm rest. The cue 
               ball strays ODDLY into the pocket near Para. Scratch.

                                     EDGY CAT
                         What?!

                                     BOZO
                         Ohhh, now that's a rough one.

                                     EDGY CAT
                         That's motherfuckin' impossible!

                                     BOZO
                              (crude Oriental accent)
                         Yoh anga will be yoh downfah. Go 
                         again?

                                     EDGY CAT
                         Goddamn it! NO!

                                     BOZO
                         Oh, come on. Crape Diem!

               Bozo takes the cash from the table. Edgy Cat sulks away 
               cursing to himself and moves to the bar.

               Roadie looks on, sipping a beer.

               Freeze on Roadie.

                         will put ya to sleep.

                                     BOZO
                         Whoa!

               Bozo approaches OLD VET (52, long hair with bandanna, dirty 
               beard) HARLEY MOM, (45, bruiser, grizzled, tough as a saddle) 
               and DRUNK GUY at the bar. The sad trio toss peanut shells 
               into three nearby tall, fat peanut barrels.

                                     BOZO
                         You boys wanna try your luck at the 
                         loot?

               Harley mom is offended. Not a word from the others.

                                     BOZO
                         Come on, I'll even throw with my 
                         left hand.

               He turns in disappointment.

                                     BOZO
                         Nothin' but a bunch of butts and 
                         pussies in here!

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT

               P.O.V. - The bar is close -- we leap a ditch.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               KRASH! Belle DROPS a tray full of drinks behind the bar.

                                     BELLE
                         Shit! Shit! Shit!

                                     BARTENDER
                         Don't sweat it, just clean it up 
                         before he's done.

               He points up to the second floor.

               INT. BAR -- SECOND FLOOR -- NIGHT

               Tuffy's son CODY (7, innocent, cute) sits on the floor 
               watching TV. Freeze on him.

               NAME: CODY 
               AGE: 7 
               OCCUPATION: TAX BREAK

               Tuffy puts headphones over his ears.

                                     TUFFY
                         Keep these on, sweetheart.

                                     CODY
                         Mommy, I want Nemo.

                                     TUFFY
                         Mommy's working on it.

               Tuffy kisses him and then moves to an adjacent room.

               ADJACENT ROOM

               Tuffy enters the room and takes off her blouse exposing her 
               breasts. She pulls up her skirt and bends over a bedpost.

                                     TUFFY
                         Let's get this over with.

               Boss Man walks up naked, except for red cowboy boots.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         I love a woman with enthusiasm.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Bozo walks to the middle of the room.

                                     BOZO
                         I got two hundred bucks says none of 
                         you can beat me!

                                     BARTENDER
                         Hey! Get quiet or get out.

                                     BOZO

                         Gimme some ACTION --

               BOOM! The double doors to the bar are kicked open by HERO 
               (30s, rugged alpha man built to kick ass).

               KRASH! Belle DROPS a second tray of drinks --

               MUSIC CUTS OUT

               Hero is scraped, bruised and bloodied. He is dressed in blue 
               denim and holds a RUST-RED SHOTGUN and GUNNY SACK.

               He SLAMS the double doors shut and props a chair against the 
               handles, securing them.

                                     HERO
                         Unless you people want to die you'll 
                         do what I say and you'll do it fast!

               Bartender cocks his SHOTGUN.

                                     BARTENDER
                         You hold it right there, mister.

                                     HERO
                         A storm of hell's coming down on 
                         this place any minute!

                                     BARTENDER
                         Drop the canon!

               Hero puts down the shotgun and moves towards Bartender.

                                     HERO
                         I'm not armed now, just hear me out.

                                     BARTENDER
                         I'll drop you and not even think 
                         about it!

                                     HERO
                         Let me explain!

                                     BARTENDER
                         You got one second to --

               Hero reveals a drool-dripping, white, GRANDPA BEAST HEAD 
               from the gunny sack and holds it out and for all to see.

                                     HERO
                         Take a good look and listen to me! 
                         There's at least a four of these 
                         things out there!

               Grandpa Beast's head has large red eyeballs and a mouth full 
               of jagged, ivory white teeth. It is like an albino jackal 
               head with spiked hair.

                                     HERO
                         I saw one of them tear up five men 
                         like they were corn on the cob!
                              (off silence, shock)
                         I don't know what they are. I don't 
                         know where they came from. All I do 
                         know is that these fuckers are fast, 
                         nasty, and hungry.

               The bar stares at him, slack-jawed.

                                     HERO
                         And they can fly. Not to mention 
                         they got claws like Ginsu knifes and 
                         more teeth than a chainsaw.

               The Bartender lowers his shotgun slightly. Fast as a snake, 
               Hero GRABS it. He notices the engraving, "THE JUDGE."

                                     HERO
                         They're like goddamn blood hungry 
                         biker tattoos come to life. They're 
                         clocking us. Right now. And we have 
                         to lock this bar down!
                              (moving around)
                         That means doors, windows, drains, 
                         and basements. We have to do it fast!

               Hero looks out the lone front window.

                                     HERO
                              (looks to Belle)
                         You! Get on that phone. Call the 
                         cops, National Guard, townies, whoever 
                         kicks ass and get 'em out here.

               Belle moves to a pay phone at the end of the bar.

                                     HERO
                         Any questions?

                                     BARTENDER
                         Who are you?

                                     HERO
                         I'm the hero --

               CRASH! A white Beast arms BURSTS through the window and SPLITS 
               Hero right down the middle. The Judge FIRES into the ceiling --

               SECOND FLOOR

               The Judge's blast blows a toe off Boss Man's RIGHT FOOT as 
               he reaches climax with Tuffy. Boss Man HOLLERS.

               MAIN BAR

               Hero's right half is JERKED outside through the window.

               Blood sprays. Rapid chomping. CRASH! The double doors are 
               kicked open, splintering the propped up chair.

               HEROINE (Native American, rugged, ripped pants, wickedly 
               hot) rushes in, slams the doors shut and instinctively kicks 
               up the RUST RED SHOTGUN. She flips it sideways and slides 
               the metal weapon through the handles of the double doors, 
               securing them.

               BAM! A massive HIT slams into the doors from the outside 
               sending Heroine SLIDING across the floor.

               She SPRINGS to her feet and drives her weight into a table 
               attempting to hoist it over the now open window.

                                     HEROINE
                         HELP ME! SOMEBODY!

               Old Vet and Harley Mom rush to Heroine's aid. They raise the 
               table to cover the gaping hole. Heroine looks outside.

                                     HEROINE
                         GET DOWN!

               A BEAST nails the rising table, just missing Heroine's face.

               The table falls, pinning Heroine.

               JUNIOR BEAST enters. He's small and too fast to see well.

               He SWIPES the heads off Old Vet and Harley Mom. Bartender 
               grabs The Judge, but he's SCRATCHED down the back.

               Junior Beast rips out the pay phone. Knocks over the TV.

               Yanks out half of Trampy's hair.

               Edgy Cat CHARGES the spastic monster with a stool.

                                     EDGY CAT
                         I got you!

               Edgy Cat misses. Junior Beast sends him FLYING into a wall.

               BLAM! BLAM! Bartender FIRES The Judge at the creature hitting 
               lights instead. An errant shot destroys Edgy Cat's face.

               Para covers as Junior Beast RIPS the back of his wheelchair.

               Roadie WHACKS Junior Beast with a chair. Stunned, it flies 
               across the room, landing in a metal ICE COOLER.

               Bozo SLAMS it closed, capturing Junior Beast.

                                     BOZO
                         Got 'cha!

               EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Shadows of THREE SHRIEKING BEASTS close in on the window...

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Bartender runs across the bar and SLAMS shut the thick wood 
               shutters. The Beasts HIT, cracking the middle.

               Roadie power lifts the table with Heroine and braces it 
               against the window for reinforcement, but a FURRY ARM busts 
               through and grabs the other half of Hero.

                                     HEROINE
                         Goddamn you!

               Blood starts to SPRAY from outside as the rest of Hero is 
               being devoured through the smallish hole.

               Heroine works a GOLD RING off of Hero's ring finger. The 
               feeding MOMMA BEAST'S head breaks in through the hole. It 
               grabs Heroine's left forearm.

               Bartender aims The Judge at the Beast...

                                     ROADIE
                         You'll hit her!

               Roadie KNOCKS The Judge up -- BLAM!

               SECOND FLOOR

               The Judge's shotgun blast blows off another toe on Boss Man's 
               RIGHT FOOT. He cries out in agony. 

               MAIN BAR

               Heroine spins and buries a splintered piece of the broken 
               chair into the ATTACKING MOMMA BEAST'S RIGHT EYE. The Beast 
               SCREECHES and jerks back, dragging the rest of Hero outside.

               Heroine clutches the ring. Shrieks and flapping wings are 
               heard outside. They dissipate. A moment of calm.

               Belle timidly holds the receiver of the busted pay phone.

               The other patrons emerge from under tables and other hiding 
               spaces in various states of shock. Junior Beast has 
               momentarily stopped moving. Bozo secures the lid with a nearby 
               PADLOCK.

                                     BOZO
                         What the FUCK was that?

               Wild-eyed and with a trembling hand, Heroine pours herself a 
               shot from the bar. She downs it and takes a long breath.

                                     HEROINE
                         The jungle has a new king.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               There is a HOLLER at the top of the stairs. Everyone turns.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Is it clear?!

                                     BARTENDER
                         Yeah.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Is there a gun pointing at you?

                                     BARTENDER
                         Nah, I got the gun.

               Boss Man hobbles down the stairs with the help of Tuffy. His 
               foot is a bloody mess. He is holding a .38.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Alright goddamn it! Who shot me!? 
                         Who did it!?

               Belle and Bartender move to his aid.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         My goddamn foot is gone! Who fuckin' 
                         shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?

                                     BARTENDER
                              (motioning to Heroine)
                         Her fella.

                                     HEROINE
                         My husband...

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?

                                     HEROINE
                         He's dead.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         What?
                              (noticing destruction)
                         What the hell happened down here?!

               Boss Man looks to Bozo.

                                     BOZO
                         I didn't do it! It was fuckin' 
                         monsters, asshole!

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Jesus Christ on the cross... someone 
                         make sense.

                                     HEROINE
                         Easy. We're surrounded by something 
                         the likes none of you have ever seen 
                         before. Some kind of animals. Real 
                         fast, volatile, predators. One went 
                         through three of your patrons like 
                         nothing.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         So, your dead hubby shot me twice, 
                         three of my customers have been eaten, 
                         and there are angry creatures outside?

                                     HEROINE
                         He only shot you once.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Huh?

                                     HEROINE
                              (re: Bartender)
                         He shot you the other time.

                                     BARTENDER
                         It was an accident. Sorry.

               Boss Man squints skeptically. Adulterer points to GRANDPA 
               BEAST'S HEAD on the bar.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Look at it!

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Fan-fuckin-tastic.

                                     TUFFY
                         My god... what is that?

                                     HEROINE
                         That's one piece of four problems.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Please elaborate.

                                     HEROINE
                         That head over there, that's the 
                         oldest of the bunch, looked like the 
                         Grandpa. We caught the little one, 
                         Junior, in the cooler there. As we've 
                         seen, what he lacks in size he more 
                         than makes up for in speed.

                                     BARTENDER
                         And the rest of 'em?

                                     HEROINE
                         Unfortunately, the worst of 'em are 
                         still outside.

               NOTE: As Heroine describes each beast, we see a slight glimpse 
               of their virtues, hidden mainly by shadows and fog.

                                     HEROINE
                         The next one is taller, but all out 
                         of proportion. Like a "teen beast."

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT

               TEEN BEAST has a big head and awkward body. He clumsily moves 
               and seems uncomfortable in his own skin.

                                     HEROINE (V.O.)
                         He was spastic, clumsy, but deadly 
                         just the same.

               INT. BAR FRONT -- NIGHT

               Heroine tends to her scratched arm.

                                     HEROINE
                         I just took the eye out of the mother. 
                         She calculates, guiding the attacks.

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT

               MOMMA BEAST flashes out from the dark. She's shorter than 
               Teen, but much wider. She has a big mouth and NATIONAL 
               GEOGRAPHIC BOOBS that hang down to her waist. She covers her 
               stabbed right eye and SCREECHES.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Heroine taps her right eye.

                                     HEROINE
                         If you are face to face with her, 
                         dive left.

                                     ROADIE
                         And the last one is the --

                                     HEROINE
                         Father. The biggest, the strongest...

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT

               A blur of muscles, bloody fur, and teeth.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               The entire bar stares at Heroine with their mouths agape.

                                     HEROINE
                         No sign of any weaknesses. No sign 
                         at all. He's an eating machine.

                                     COACH
                         Of all the friggin' bars to be stuck 
                         in.

                                     HEROINE
                         That's not it. Four are here, but 
                         there's three others... which I can't 
                         account for.

               Heroine eyes the room.

                                     HEROINE
                         We need to lock this place down. Is 
                         everyone in this room?

                                     TUFFY
                         Oh my god! My son! My SON!

               Tuffy races toward the staircase to the SECOND FLOOR.

                                     HEROINE
                         Wait!

               Tuffy is halfway up the stairs.

                                     TUFFY
                         Cody! Mommy's coming! Mommy's coming!

                                     HEROINE
                         Stop her!

                                     BARTENDER
                         Hey!

               SECOND FLOOR

               Tuffy BURSTS through the door. Cody sits by the TV, unmoved. 

                                     CODY
                         Mommy --

               Tuffy pulls Cody into her arms. Heroine and Bartender halt 
               to guard the doorway. Heroine spots a SMALL PORTAL WINDOW.

                                     TUFFY
                         Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? 
                         Mommy is never gonna let you go!

                                     HEROINE
                         Let's lock off this room.

                                     TUFFY
                              (moving to exit)
                         Never, ever, never. Never, ever, 
                         never, baby. I love you --

               SMASH! Papa Beast BURSTS through the portal window and RIPS 
               Cody's torso from Tuffy's grasp. Tuffy holds his DANGLING 
               ARMS. Blood sprays everywhere.

                                     TUFFY
                         NOOOOOOOO!

               Papa Beast LUNGES at Tuffy! Bartender SHOOTS, nailing Papa 
               Beast. He hisses, but can't fit through the small window.

               Bartender aims again for a kill shot, but Papa Beast 
               projectile vomits Cody's remains at Bartender.

               Papa Beast retracts out the portal window. Heroine SLAMS the 
               wood shutters closed.

               Tuffy drops Cody's arms. Bug-eyed. She moves, zombie-like, 
               to the staircase. Bartender follows, covered in Papa Beast's 
               bile. Heroine locks the staircase door shut.

                                     HEROINE
                         Damn it.

               MAIN BAR

               Beer Guy stares at the bile covered Bartender.

                                     BEER GUY
                         Oh god...

               He hands him a towel. Tuffy slowly walks towards the rest of 
               the patrons. The blood on her face and chest tells them what 
               happened. The horror hits home.

               Heroine eyes the destroyed phone.

                                     COACH
                              (to Tuffy)
                         Are you --

               Heroine puts a hand up to silence Coach.

                                     HEROINE
                         Just let her be... please.
                              (beat)
                         Is that the only phone?

               Bartender emerges from the back holding a mess of plastic 
               and wires.

                                     BARTENDER
                         The back phone is wrecked, too.

               Trampy's eyes light up and she digs through her purse.

                                     BELLE
                         This is really happening. I can't 
                         believe this is really happening.

               Grandpa and Grandma have calmly re-taken their seats.

                                     GRANDPA
                         What'd you say?

                                     GRANDMA
                         I didn't say anything.

               Bartender hesitantly tosses a wash towel over the Grandpa 
               Beast head at the end of the bar.

               Para is awkwardly trying to fix the back of his wheelchair.

               Belle moves over to help and sees a mess of wires coming 
               from the wheelchair's back rest.

                                     PARA
                         Thank you, but I don't need any help --

                                     BELLE
                         What's this? A power magnet or 
                         something?

                                     PARA
                         No. It's nothing.

               Belle puts together his scam with a smirk.

                                     BELLE
                         I didn't peg you for a con man.

                                     PARA
                         Hey, it pays more than the couch.

                                     BELLE
                         Lots of stuff around here does.

               Trampy pulls out a CELLULAR PHONE from her purse.

                                     TRAMPY
                         Here!

               The group looks over. Adulterer GRABS it.

                                     TRAMPY
                         Hey!

                                     ADULTERER
                         Back off!

               Beer Guy walks from behind the bar.

                                     BEER GUY
                         So, what now? Did those things leave?

                                     BOZO
                         Why don't you go check it out?

                                     BEER GUY
                         Fuck no.

                                     ADULTERER
                              (into cell phone)
                         I have a signal! I have -- Diane? 
                         Diane listen to me... get the kids 
                         and get in the basement... do it 
                         right now...

               Trampy stares with grief in her eyes.

                                     ADULTERER
                         I'll explain later. Not now! I'm at 
                         a bar... look... shut up! JUST SHUT 
                         UP AND GET IN THE FUCKING BASEMENT, 
                         DIANE! Diane! Diane?... Hello? Damn 
                         it! I lost the signal!

               Adulterer looks at the phone a bit dazed.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Okay. Okay. Look now, I gotta get 
                         outta here! I gotta go! My wife... 
                         See my wife is alone... She could be 
                         in trouble. I GOTTA GO!

               He moves towards the front door. Heroine moves into his path.

                                     HEROINE
                         I wouldn't do that.

               Adulterer, violently grabs Heroine to shove her away.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Fuck you, bitch!

               Heroine nails Adulterer with THREE HITS to the chin, throat 
               and chest, flipping him to the floor. She pulls a KNIFE from 
               her belt buckle and has it under Adulterer's chin.

                                     HEROINE
                         You can risk your life, but not mine! 
                         My daughter's no more than twenty 
                         miles from here waiting for me. I 
                         have just as much reason to leave 
                         this place as you do. But I also 
                         know that if they're here, then 
                         they're not there yet.

               Adulterer squirms.

                                     HEROINE
                         You understand me?

                                     ADULTERER
                         Get the fuck off...

                                     HEROINE
                         You understand me!?

                                     ADULTERER
                         Yes!

                                     HEROINE
                         Now pull that tough boy shit again 
                         and I'll slice you from neck to nuts!

               Adulterer nods obediently. Heroine removes the knife from 
               his neck and plants it back into her buckle.

                                     ADULTERER
                         You can't keep me here. This is 
                         bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is 
                         fucking BULLSHIT!

                                     HEROINE
                         We can't risk letting them in.

                                     ADULTERER
                              (trembling, pissed)
                         Right.

               Adulterer takes his seat. He looks over at the half bald 
               Trampy. She looks at him, hurt.

               At the bar, Bozo puts the TV back into place, he jiggles 
               with some wires in the back, bringing back the picture.

                                     BOZO
                         Anything?

                                     PARA
                         Yeah, you got it.

               The bar takes notice. Trampy, cell phone in hand, paws through 
               a phone book as she watches the broadcast.

                                     BELLE
                         See! This has to be isolated. That's 
                         a local broadcast.

               ON TV: The Newscaster reads the teleprompter.

                                     NEWSCASTER
                         And now, we head to our man on the 
                         scene with a live look at tomorrow's 
                         event in Red Mountain.

               Heroine eagerly looks on, moving closer to the TV.

                                     HEROINE
                         My daughter's in Red Mountain.

               ON TV: There is an awkward pause from the Newscaster. The 
               broadcast doesn't cut to the reporter.

                                     NEWSCASTER
                         Can you hear us? Apparently we're 
                         having some technical difficulties...

               Heroine sinks in her skin.

                                     HEROINE
                         Oh no.

                                     NEWSCASTER
                         Oh, there we go!

               ON TV: A REPORTER, in an even worse suit, stands in a field 
               with several people looking through telescopes.

                                     REPORTER
                         That's right, the crowds are lining 
                         up early to witness tomorrow's 
                         meteorological phenomenon.

               Heroine sighs a gust of relief.

                                     REPORTER
                         But always remember, don't look 
                         straight into the sun because a 
                         special filter is needed to avoid 
                         damaging your cornea.

               The Reporter beams.

                                     REPORTER
                         And we're all looking forward to it 
                         tomorrow. Back to you.

               In the studio, the Newscaster smirks.

                                     NEWSCASTER
                         Thank you. And in other news...

               Roadie points to the TV.

                                     ROADIE
                         That studio's local, we can call in.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         I have a short wave radio upstairs.

               Trampy is already dialing on the cell.

                                     TRAMPY
                         I'm calling them... it's ringing!

                                     ROADIE
                         They'd have a police scanner.

                                     TRAMPY
                              (into cell)
                         Hello? Yes, we're at the United --

               ON TV: the Newscaster continues his routine.

                                     NEWSCASTER
                         ...it has been reported that the 
                         power outage --

               A Beast arm REACHES in and TEARS off Newscaster's jaw. The 
               bar gasps in horror as his blood sprays. ZAP! The broadcast 
               cuts out, turning to static.

               Trampy screams and DROPS the cell, SHATTERING on impact.

                                     TRAMPY
                         Oh no! Oh fucking no!

               Heroine, tense, quells the rising panic.

                                     HEROINE
                         Keep it together! I came from the 
                         east. That studio is south of here. 
                         For all we know, north and west are 
                         okay.

                                     ROADIE
                         An associate of mine was coming in 
                         from the north, ain't heard a word 
                         from him in hours.

                                     HEROINE
                         So, that leaves the west.

               Tuffy looks up from a booth, clearing her throat.

                                     TUFFY
                         And Red Mountain. Your daughter.

               Heroine looks over, making eye contact.

                                     HEROINE
                         Right.

                                     BEER GUY
                         This is goddamn depressing.

               At the door, Heroine slides a thick metal pole through the 
               double door handles and takes out the Rust Red shotgun.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         I've got some tools and extra planks 
                         in the kitchen, if we're on the same 
                         page here.

                                     HEROINE
                         Let's work.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               The last board is hammered into place as the survivors back 
               away from the now re-enforced bar.

                                     BARTENDER
                         We'll it ain't pretty...

                                     BOSS MAN
                         But its got teeth.

               BAM-BAM-BAM! Junior Beast bangs around in the ice cooler.

                                     BOZO
                         I think it's hungry again.

                                     HEROINE
                         We have to kill it.
                              (to Boss Man)
                         Can you help?

               Boss Man hobbles over to the cooler and aims his .38. Junior 
               Beast goes wild, trying to get out.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Fire in the hole!

               Bullets rip through the cooler. Junior squeals. More shots.

               Casings hit the ground. Smoke rises. Bozo leans in.

                                     BOZO
                         I think we got --

               RAH! A tiny white arm fires out from the cooler GRABBING 
               Bozo's leg. Bozo yelps.

               Moving quick, Tuffy grabs The Judge from Bartender and shoves 
               the barrel into a hole.

               BLAM! Guts splatter. Bozo falls back unscathed. He catches 
               his breath and looks to Tuffy. She is born again, seething.

                                     TUFFY
                         You're welcome.

               She hands the shotgun back to Bartender.

                                     TRAMPY
                         Jesus, it took all that? All those 
                         bullets? How can we possibly fight 
                         off the others?

                                     HEROINE
                         Aim for their orifices. Eyes, ears 
                         and mouth. From what I've seen, it's 
                         their only weakness.

                                     ROADIE
                              (looking at the corpse)
                         Looks like they're soft on the inside 
                         like any other animal. Trick is to 
                         get in there and do the damage.

                                     BELLE
                         Maybe we don't have to fight them.

                                     BOZO
                         Right, let's just call 'em names.

               Coach steps forward, poised to make the sale.

                                     COACH
                         Ladies and gentlemen, if I may have 
                         your attention.

               The bar skeptically eyes the large, sweaty Greek man.

                                     COACH
                         We have to think outside the box 
                         here. We don't need to fight them, 
                         we need to scare them. Scare them 
                         right back. This is a species stand-
                         off. We just need to show them we're 
                         not vulnerable. That we're formidable.

                                     ADULTERER
                         How?

                                     COACH
                         I need a stick.

               Bartender opens the cooler's lid and carefully pulls out 
               Junior Beast with salad tongs. It falls to the floor with a 
               SPLAT. Coach grabs a splintered broomstick.

                                     COACH
                         Stand back.

               He buries the broomstick into Junior's side and carries the 
               limp carcass towards a covered hole in the wall.

                                     COACH
                         Let's get that board down.

               Roadie pries off a board to reveal a pumpkin sized hole. 

                                     HEROINE
                         What are you doing?

               Coach shoves Junior's mangled body through to the outside.

                                     COACH
                         Showing superiority. The scent of 
                         their dead may drive them away.

               The whole bar moves to the side wall to see how the Beast 
               family will react. They look through SMALL HOLES, barely 
               able to see anything.

                                     BEER GUY
                         I don't see them.

                                     COACH
                         Come on. Come onnnnnn.

                                     BELLE
                         Is there a call, or something?

                                     BOZO
                         See that you monkey fucks! That's 
                         what you get when you mess with us!

                         Shit don't make me gay because you'll 
                         be sucking my dick!

               Bozo's insult hangs in the air.

               P.O.V - THROUGH SMALL HOLES

               WHOOSH! Junior is swiped from the handmade pike.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Coach jerks back. The startled group tries to focus, but 
               it's too dark outside. With the moon as the only light, Father 
               Beast can barely be made out cradling his dead child.

               Silhouettes of the other family members slowly approach 
               Junior. Papa Beast is gentle and it's almost endearing.

                         It's working. I think it's working.

                         You see? What I tell you?

               The whole group starts to ease. Then... Papa Beast HOLLERS.

               P.O.V. - THROUGH SMALL HOLES

               Papa Beast lets out a HORRID WAIL. The group jumps back, 
               covering their ears. Then, something really odd happens.  
               Momma tosses Junior in the air, opens her wide jaws and 
               SWALLOWS HIM WHOLE.

               P.O.V. - THROUGH SMALL HOLES

               Papa Beast moves behind Momma Beast and grabs hold of her.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               A steady "thud-thud-thud" rhythm vibrates the bar. Grandpa's 
               drink starts to hop to edge of his table with the beats. The 
               group maneuvers to get a better look.

                                     TRAMPY

               Yes, Momma Beast and Papa Beast are having MONSTER SEX.

               P.O.V. - THROUGH SMALL HOLES

               Unlike humans, Papa Beast finishes and the birth cycle lasts 
               all of thirty seconds. Momma Beast's belly balloons up and 
               she squats. POP! A SLIMY OBJECT the size and shape of a vacuum 
               cleaner drops from her.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Trampy VOMITS.

               P.O.V. - THROUGH SMALL HOLES

               The slimy object SPLITS in half. The two halves spring 
               appendages and raise their heads. The TWIN SISTER BEASTS 
               have been born.

               Papa moves forward and cleans off his new baby girls. The 
               Beast Girls look at the bar and hiss in unison.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Heroine's eyes bulge.

                         Get back!

               SLAM-SLAM! The two hissing Beast Girls strike the bar front.

               Roadie shoves that board back over the hole. Beer Guy is 
               holding back the still heaving Trampy's hair.

               Bozo pops open a beer off the back of Para's wheelchair.

               Roadie nods to Grandpapa Beast's head on the end of the bar.

                         Well, it all started about forty 
                         hours ago...

               Hero and his overweight friend TUBBS (35, hard living career 
               farm hand) laugh at a TV show while Heroine paces on the 
               telephone in the background.

                                     HEROINE
                              (into phone)
                         So, how is staying with Grandma 
                         working out? Ya know, if you stare 
                         into her glasses, you can see what 
                         cards she is holding. But I didn't 
                         tell you that.

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- CONTINUOUS

               There's a home on the horizon with a big barn next to it.

               Shrieking and flapping grows in the distance.

               INT. FARMHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

               Heroine starts to peek out of the window.

                                     HEROINE
                         Mommy will pick you up tomorrow night, 
                         okay baby?

               The phone cuts out.

                                     HEROINE
                         Hello? Charlie?

               Heroine and Hero look at each other with concern. Hero looks 
               out the window.

                         We barricaded ourselves in the cellar. 
                         Then it was just listening. We heard 
                         those things destroy an entire heard 
                         of livestock. They just kept coming. 
                         Closer and closer, consuming anything 
                         in the way. Slashing, feeding and 
                         licking the bones clean. Just when 
                         we said our prayers, the first ray 
                         of sun hit the house...

               EXT. FARMHOUSE -- MORNING

               PLOP! A HORSE'S HEAD falls as Heroine and her companions 
               peek out from the damaged cellar door.

                                     HEROINE
                         That first beam of sunlight drove 
                         'em away. Somewhere. We called who 
                         we could and then decided to run for 
                         it. We didn't see a soul the whole 
                         drive out. When the tank went dry, 
                         we came upon a gas station to refill.

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- LATE DAY

               The sun is falling into the horizon. The traveler's CAMARO 
               pulls into a small gas station

               EXT. GAS STATION -- CONTINUOUS

               Heroine goes up to the service window with Tubbs and looks 
               inside. Nobody. There is a slight BUZZING from inside.

               Hero hollers from the fuel pump by the car.

                                     HERO
                         What's goin' on? The pumps are off.

                                     TUBBS
                         There's nobody here --

               She follows the buzzing sound to a corner of the room. There 
               is a swarm of black flies crawling over half a STATION 
               ATTENDANT'S gutted torso.

                                     HEROINE
                         They've been here!

                                     HERO
                         Turn on the pump!

               Glass shatters as Heroine reaches inside to turn on the pumps.

                         We had no time. All we knew was the 
                         sun was dropping and we had to get 
                         enough fuel to make it through the 
                         night at 90 miles per hour...

               EXT. GAS STATION -- LATE DAY

               Hero fills their Camaro.

                                     HERO
                         Suck it down you metal bitch. Suck 
                         it down.

               INT. GAS STATION -- CONTINUOUS

               Heroine and Tubbs hastily grabs food and drinks, ignoring 
               the cash register completely. The sun is setting.

               EXT. GAS STATION -- CONTINUOUS

               Hero turns as a shrill HISSING comes from the shadows...

               EXT. GAS STATION -- LATE DAY

               Heroine and Tubbs emerge from the gas station shop.

                         Move it!

               Heroine and Tubbs hear the growing cries of the Beasts.

               Their loot hits the pavement as they run.

                                     HERO
                         Get in the car, baby.

               Hero drops the spilling gas nozzle. Tubbs slides into the 
               back as Heroine jumps into the driver's seat.

               Hero runs over the top of the Camaro and slides into the 
               sunroof. He grabs a rifle and aims toward the leaking gas 
               pool. Something rises in the gas station.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

                                     HEROINE

                         just for a second.

               EXT. GAS STATION -- SUNSET

               Three lean, muscular shapes rise from the shadows.

                         Roll!

               Heroine fires up the car and tears out. Hero shoots and the 
               station becomes a FIREBALL.

               Hero lowers into the back seat and starts to close the roof 
               as STRIPPED COUSIN BEAST lands on top of the car...

                                     HERO
                         Shit!

               Stripped Cousin Beast PUNCHES through the back window, 
               reaching for them. Heroine jerks the wheel.

               The car 180's and the Beast sails off of the car into 
               darkness. The Camaro tears down a tangent dirt road.

                                     HERO
                         We made it!

               Hero reaches back to give a "five" to Tubbs. Tubbs doesn't 
               respond. Heroine is the first to see Tubbs' quivering, 
               HEADLESS body in the back seat.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Heroine stands near Grandpa Beast's head.

                         It must have smelled the blood or 
                         something. We buried the body and 
                         got back on the main road when...

               INT. CAMARO -- NIGHT

               BOOM! Grandpa Beast LANDS on the front hood of the Camaro.

               Heroine and Hero SCREAM and rev the engine, swerving madly 
               as Grandpa Beast VOMITS on the windshield.

                                     HERO
                         Break!

               Heroine slams on the breaks. Grandpa Beast slides back, 
               holding onto the grill.

                                     HERO
                         Go! Go! Go!

               Grandpa Beast tears into the engine through the grill as 
               sparks and smoke shoot out. Heroine jerks the steering wheel.

               INT. CAMARO -- NIGHT

               The car crashes into a ditch, DECAPITATING Grandpa Beast.

               His head FIRES through the windshield, landing on Heroine's 
               lap. Its snake-like tongue lashes out at Heroine's crotch.

                         No. It was wild out there. No time 
                         to think. We just moved. He didn't 
                         leave me. He just ran.

               Para wheels over to a COUNTY MAP on the side wall.

                         The three from the gas pump are over 
                         at the TV station? And you say there's 
                         four here, huh?

                         should play "Chief" tonight. Someone 
                         that knows the lay of the land.

               Para stares intently at the map. Adulterer moves over to the 
               window that has shutters over it, peeking through a hole.

                         Maybe these things are like locusts 
                         or something and only come out for a 
                         few days to feed. This could just be 
                         a part of their life cycle.

                         Somebody's gotta know something about 
                         these things. This stuff just doesn't 
                         happen out of the blue.

               The room is silent. Bozo looks around, quickly moving towards 
               Grandpa and Grandma.

               Grandpa holds on to Grandma's hand as he speaks.

                                     GRANDPA
                         You young'uns worry about weapons, 
                         I'm thinkin' 'bout strategy.

                                     BOZO
                         Oh? And what's that?

                                     GRANDPA
                         Sit still, look less like a meal.

                                     BOZO
                         That's for bears and sharks, chunky 
                         chew.

               The group looks back to Heroine.

                                     HEROINE
                         Alright, what else do we have? Can 
                         we somehow contact the outside world?

               Trampy pensively stays on her fractured phone.

                                     TRAMPY
                         I can't get anybody. I don't even 
                         know if I have a signal anymore.

                                     BEER GUY
                         I have a CB in my truck, we could 
                         get some help out here.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Who the hell would you call?

                                     BEER GUY
                         Anyone.

                                     BOZO
                         Do you drive a short beer bus or 
                         something? You go out there, you get 
                         eaten. You stay in here, you get 
                         eaten. Anyone comes to help, they 
                         get eaten. Don't you see a pattern 
                         here, Spuds Makenzie?

                                     BEER GUY
                         Then I guess we should just give up.

                                     BOZO
                              (re: Trampy)
                         Believe me, I'd love to save the day 
                         and get some heroic snatch, but it's 
                         not in the cards, partner.

                                     HEROINE
                              (to Boss Man)
                         You said you had a short wave radio.

                                     TRAMPY
                         Where?

                                     BARTENDER
                         Upstairs.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Go for it. It's by the far wall. 
                         Channel 9 is the emergency frequency.

                                     HEROINE
                         Good. I'm heading to the basement 
                         for supplies.
                              (to Bozo)
                         And you're going upstairs.

               Bozo blinks. A little taken aback.

                                     BOZO
                         Let's not get carried away...

                                     HEROINE
                         Step up, Chief.

                                     BOZO
                         So that's how it is?
                              (hands out)
                         Fine! Shotgun, please.

               Bartender hands him The Judge.

                                     BOZO
                              (to Bartender)
                         You're coming with, portly. 'Cause 
                         if I'm attacked, I want a fat man 
                         close by.

                                     BARTENDER
                         I'll wait by the door.

                                     BOZO
                         Now who else is comin'?

               No one budges.

                                     GRANDPA
                              (rising from his seat)
                         I'll go with ya.

                                     BOZO
                         What are you gonna do? Throw your 
                         teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon.

               Bartender moves to the back of the bar, grabbing his machete.

               At the same moment, Coach emerges from behind the bar in 
               very snug, feminine-looking pink sweat pants.

                                     BOZO
                         You! Zorba! You're coming too!
                              (to Heroine)
                         Now gimme the keys.

               Heroine tosses the keys to Bartender.

                                     HEROINE
                         No. You're locked in.

                                     BOZO
                         What?

                                     HEROINE
                         Those two will be on the other side 
                         waiting for you. If you become food, 
                         I don't want the only set of keys in 
                         the belly of one of those things.

                                     BOZO
                         Don't get your hopes up.

               Bozo moves to the staircase. There's blood at the bottom and 
               it gets worse with each step. Bartender and Coach follow.

               Heroine turns to the bar.

                                     HEROINE
                         Any volunteers to head into the 
                         basement with me?

                                     TUFFY
                         I will.

               Tuffy stands, sniffling. She wipes the tears from her eyes, 
               looking tough and resolute.

                                     BEER GUY
                         That's not a good idea.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         With what happened upstairs --

                                     TUFFY
                         Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have 
                         no idea what is running through me 
                         right now. No idea.
                              (to Heroine)
                         I'm ready.

                                     HEROINE
                         Alright.

                                     ROADIE
                         Count me in.

                                     BEER GUY
                         Me too.

               Heroine, Tuffy, Roadie, and Beer Guy all move to the basement. 
               The door creaks open slowly. The group descends.

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

               Bozo slightly slips on the blood. He grips the railing and 
               pulls himself up the staircase like an old man.

                                     BOZO
                         Alright you two, I don't want to 
                         hear any of this, "oh, I dropped the 
                         key, wrong key, ain't no key here." 
                         When I want out, I want out, ok?

                                     BARTENDER
                              (displaying keys)
                         They're right here.

                                     COACH
                         We've got your back, bro.

               They unlock the door, swinging it open.

                                     BOZO
                         Just keep 'em handy, ladies.

               Bartender has the key in the thick dead bolt, ready to move.

               SECOND FLOOR

               Bozo hustles in. The door shuts and locks.

                                     BOZO
                         Wish me luck...

               WHAM! Bozo is on the ground.

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

                                     BOZO (O.S.)
                         I'm okay! I'm okay!

               SECOND FLOOR

               Bozo rises and nervously surveys the damaged floor.

                                     BOZO
                         Come on. Come on. Come on.

               Bozo jumps when he sees the gore and the bloody shoes from 
               Cody's attack. The TV illuminates the room.

                                     BOZO
                         Geeezzzus.
                              (moving gingerly)
                         Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. 
                         Easy steps.

               MAIN BAR

               Belle kneels next to the Boss Man.

                                     BELLE
                         How are you holding up?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Well...

               He pulls a bottle out of his pocket and hands it to her.

                                     BELLE
                         What is this?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Morphine. My magic potion. I need a 
                         few drops.

               She puts a few drops on his out-stretched tongue.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         You should try a little, it'll calm 
                         your nerves. Works like a charm.

                                     BELLE
                         No other time than now, right?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Wait, before you do that, help me 
                         move. There's a small room off the 
                         kitchen where I can lay down.

                                     BELLE
                         But --

                                     BOSS MAN
                         It's much safer in there. Trust me.

               BASEMENT

               The basement is dark, dingy and scattered with crap. Dried 
               out ANIMAL CARCASSES hang from the ceiling on hooks. A WINDOW 
               is open. Roadie slams it shut, eyeing the room, staring into 
               the dark corners.

                                     ROADIE
                         Stay on your toes everybody.

               Tuffy tightly grips her weapon, ready to fire. Heroine kneels 
               next to a hatch door that emits a red glow.

                                     HEROINE
                         What's this?

               Roadie jams a pipe into the little door, bracing it shut.

                                     ROADIE
                         You don't need to know what that is.

               Beer Guy finds the dusty locker and opens it.

                                     BEER GUY
                         There's a sawed-off shotgun in here.

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

               Bartender and Coach have their ears pressed to the door.

                                     COACH
                         Come on, bro.

               Behind them, through a boarded window, something CRAWLS 
               upward.

               SECOND FLOOR

               Bozo moves turtle slow.

                                     BOZO
                         Lamaze. Lamaze. Lamaze.

               He moves to the Boss Man's private room. He puts his hand 
               out to open it. Trembling, he touches the knob and...

               CREEEEEEEEAK! The door eases open. Bozo steps inside the 
               room. He moves over to a lamp and pulls the chain. A bat 
               FLIES off the lamp shade SCREECHING. Bozo falls backwards.

                                     BOZO
                         HAAAA!

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

               Bartender and Coach jump back.

               SECOND FLOOR

               Bozo gets off the floor again. He may have filled his pants.

                                     BOZO
                         Just a bat! I'm okay! Just a bat!

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

                                     BARTENDER
                         If he doesn't shut up...

                                     COACH
                         He is human kabob.

               SMALL ROOM OFF KITCHEN

               The room is like a converted pantry. Boss Man lies on a cot, 
               kissing Belle. A tiny wall fan spins providing ventilation.

               Belle pulls away and brushes back her long hair.

                                     BELLE
                         Doesn't your foot hurt?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         I can't feel a thing, Hon.

                                     BELLE
                              (touching his crotch)
                         How 'bout now?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         You're a bad girl, aren't you.

               Belle, a bit high, sways and starts to remove her clothes.

                                     BELLE
                         Um-hmmm.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         The girl's got rhythm.

               She takes off her blouse and tosses it at him. She then lifts 
               up her skirt and bends over, giggling.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         There it is.

               BASEMENT

               Roadie emerges with two crates. He dumps them on the floor.

                                     ROADIE
                         This is all junk.

               Beer Guy holds a rusted machete.

                         This could come in handy.

                                     HEROINE
                         Let's get everything upstairs.

               Heroine moves to the stairs, but stops. She grabs Tuffy by 
               the arm and takes her aside.

                                     HEROINE
                         I'm sorry.

                                     TUFFY
                         Don't worry, I'm fine. Really.

                                     HEROINE
                         I admire your strength.

                                     TUFFY
                         Trust me, I plan on having a full 
                         breakdown when this is over, but for 
                         now, we all have to be strong, right?

               Heroine reaches into her shirt and pulls out an IDENTICAL 
               LOCKET as Tuffy's. She opens it and displays a picture of a 
               LITTLE GIRL.

                                     HEROINE
                         This is my daughter, Charlie. She's 
                         all I'm after.

                                     TUFFY
                              (fighting back tears)
                         Oh...

                                     HEROINE
                         And I'm gonna need your strength, 
                         every bit of it.

                                     TUFFY
                         You have it.

                                     HEROINE
                         Good. But still do me a favor.

                                     TUFFY
                         Name it.

                                     HEROINE
                              (with a wink)
                         Don't tell anyone I have a soft side.

                                     TUFFY
                              (tiny smile)
                         Deal.

               SECOND FLOOR

               Bozo turns and points the gun around the room. He sees the 
               CB. It is like an intercom with a cable running outside. He 
               drops the shotgun and fidgets with the CB knobs.

                                     BOZO
                         Hello? Anyone there? We need help 
                         out here at the United Nations Tavern. 
                         Send guns, tanks, and all that shit. 
                         10-4. S.O.S.

               All he gets is static. A faint GROWL is heard outside. OUTSIDE 
               THE DOOR Bartender hears the growl, his eyes grow wide.

               SMALL ROOM OFF KITCHEN

               Belle rubs her hands over her rounded ass and flicks her 
               tongue at Boss Man.

                                     BELLE
                         You wanna see, baby?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Hell yeah.

                                     BELLE
                         How much you got?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         How much I got, what?

                                     BELLE
                         How much you got to see the show?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         You don't understand, sweety. Daddy 
                         doesn't pay. Daddy sees the show for 
                         free. But you do get points for being 
                         horny on a night like this.

               She cringes and backs up a little.

                                     BELLE
                         What?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         You can't expect a man to buy a car 
                         without a test drive first, can you?

                                     BELLE
                         Um, hmm --

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Now wiggle that sweet little ass 
                         over here and sit on Daddy's face, I 
                         wanna do some appraising.

               SECOND FLOOR

               Bozo barks into the CB.

                                     BOZO
                         Repeat. We need help. SOS. Calling 
                         all cars! Calling all cars! We need 
                         help at the United Nations Tav --

               The CB is JERKED from Bozo's hands and slams into the wall.

                                     BOZO
                         Shit!

               Bozo aims the gun at the wall. Chewing sounds begin.

                                     BOZO
                         Double shit!

               He backs up to the door.

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

                                     BOZO (O.S.)
                         Okay, I'm ready to come out now!

               Bartender confidently turns the key. CLICK! It breaks off in 
               the lock.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Oh!

                         mean?

               Bozo knocks on the door hard.

                                     BOZO
                         HEY! OPEN IT!!!

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

               Bartender looks to Coach.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Wha?

               A thunderous CRASH! Boards fly off the wall.

               SMALL ROOM OFF KITCHEN

               Belle, hearing the crash, jerks back from Boss Man.

                                     BELLE
                         What was that?

               CRASH! Sister Beast #1 and Sister Beast #2 punch through the 
               tiny wall fan and GRAB Belle by the scalp. She is JERKED 
               against the wall.

               She's slammed against it repeatedly and then -- RIP! Belle's 
               skin is TORN from her head and torso. Boss Man jumps back.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Hoh-SHIT! Help!! Help me!!!

               Belle falls into Boss Man's arms for a HIDEOUS KISS.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         NO! NO! NO!

               Boss Man shoves the bloody Belle back against the wall.

               Sister Beast #1 pokes her head inside the room, hissing. 

               MAIN BAR

               Heroine and the others, just returning from the basement, 
               hear the mayhem from upstairs and the kitchen.

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

               Coach fumbles desperately with the jammed lock, trying to 
               use his fingernails to turn the metal stump.

                                     COACH
                         Great god, why do you damn me?!

               Bozo bangs on the door and looks over his shoulder at the 
               Momma and Papa Beast chomping at the wall.

               SMALL ROOM OFF KITCHEN

               Boss Man uses the cot to block the Sister Beasts from 
               entering. They hiss and shred the cot fabric.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         They're getting in! Somebody help!

               MAIN BAR

               Heroine charges up the staircase. Roadie rips the sawed-off 
               weapon from Beer Guy and runs for the kitchen.

               Heroine rips the earring from Bartender's ear. He YELPS. She 
               jams the backing into the lock.

               SMALL ROOM OFF KITCHEN

               Boss Man crawls for the door. Sister Beast #1 fires out a 
               whip-like tongue and snags Boss Man's damaged foot. He howls 
               in pain. Sister Beast #2 tongue-lasso's his other foot.

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

               Heroine's picking fingers are bleeding from her effort.

                         HELLLLLP!!!

               Roadie kicks open the door and FIRES at the Sisters. They 
               dive back out of the room screeching.

               Right behind Bozo, the boards fly off the portal window.

               Papa Beast flies at Bozo. Bozo spins and aimlessly FIRES his 
               shotgun, hitting Papa Beast directly in the groin.

               The door flies open. Bozo is YANKED to safety just as Papa 
               STRIKES the closing door.

               The patrons track the wild CRASHING and HIGH-PITCHED SHRIEKING

               Beer Guy and Roadie carry Boss Man into the room as Coach,

               Coach eyes the group, this is his time to shine.

               Coach sits down, humbled.

                                     HEROINE
                         We know what not to do. We must stay 
                         focused and together. The beasts 
                         will find a breach. We gotta find a 
                         way out before they find a way in.

                                     TUFFY
                         Let's run for the cars, cause mass 
                         confusion.

                                     BARTENDER
                         The lot's too damn far, that's 
                         surefire suicide.

               The room is silent. Bartender motions to Boss Man, but he is 
               promptly shushed by Boss Man. Heroine notices.

                                     HEROINE
                              (to Boss Man)
                         What?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         What?

                                     HEROINE
                         You know what.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         I don't know shit.

                                     HEROINE
                              (to Roadie)
                         You. What was that door downstairs?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Wait, wait, wait.

               Heroine glares at Roadie.

                                     HEROINE
                         Don't bullshit me.

                                     BARTENDER
                         It's a tunnel.

               Roadie nods, causing Boss Man to sigh.

                                     BARTENDER
                         It runs about a hundred yards and 
                         spits out on the backside of that 
                         hill down the way.

                                     HEROINE
                         What's it for?

               They clam up.

                                     HEROINE
                         What's it for!?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Grass, man. I grow pot down there.

                                     HEROINE
                         Does the tunnel spit out near a car?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         It spits out behind the parking lot.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         My truck is near, but it ain't nearly 
                         big enough to haul the whole lot.

                                     HEROINE
                         It's a shot. Is it gassed up?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Fully.

                                     HEROINE
                         Four door?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Two.

                                     HEROINE
                         How many can it hold?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Six.

                                     HEROINE
                         Max?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Seven.

                                     HEROINE
                         It's gonna fit thirteen.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Thirteen clowns wouldn't fit.

                                     HEROINE
                              (with hand out)
                         Keys.

                                     ROADIE
                         What're you planning?

                                     HEROINE
                         Three of us go. Two to defend, one 
                         to drive. We back up to the bar and 
                         then tear ass out of here.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Sounds sketchy.

                                     HEROINE
                         Let me make this clear; if we stay, 
                         we die.

               Boss Man reluctantly pulls out some keys that are on a string 
               around his neck.

                                     ROADIE
                         Give 'em to me, I'm going.

                                     BARTENDER
                         You're trusting that con? He'll ditch 
                         us and never look back.

                                     ROADIE
                         Fuck you too.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Get in line!

                                     HEROINE
                         Hey! I'm not trusting him either, 
                         that's why I'm going with.

               Coach stands forward.

                                     COACH
                         "Courage is being scared to death, 
                         but saddling up anyway."
                              (off blank stares)
                         The Duke. I will go.

                                     HEROINE
                         This is it. They have this place 
                         surrounded, but if we go under them 
                         we might just make it.

                                     BARTENDER
                         This is a bottleneck waiting to 
                         happen.

               SMACK! Bozo SLAPS Coach's ass.

                                     BOZO
                         This one's great under pressure. I 
                         wish you luck.

                                     HEROINE
                         The rest of you prepare the weapons, 
                         whatever you got left. 'Cause when 
                         we crash through those walls, we're 
                         bringin' death with us.

               Heroine takes The Judge from Bartender and hands it to Coach.

                                     COACH
                         No, I don't believe in guns.

                                     BARTENDER
                         This ain't time for a political 
                         stance.

               Coach takes the rusty machete from Beer Guy.

                                     COACH
                         This doesn't run out of ammo.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Got ya.

               Heroine, Roadie, and Coach move to the basement.

                                     BOZO
                         Hey!

               The three look to Bozo, who offers a parting nod.

                                     BOZO
                         When you get to that truck... drive 
                         it like you stole it.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               At a booth, Trampy re-bandages Adulterer's eye.

                                     TRAMPY
                         How does it feel?

                                     ADULTERER
                         Lousy.

                                     TRAMPY
                         You still have one left.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Yes, the silver lining.

                                     TRAMPY
                         It serves you right for cheating.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Spare me.

                                     TRAMPY
                         I figure it's karma. You wronged me 
                         and you wronged your wife, so this 
                         is karma biting you on the ass, or 
                         in your case... in the eye.

               Bozo moves close, surveying the bandage work.

                                     BOZO
                         Oh yeah?

                                     TRAMPY
                         It could be worse, you could be dead. 
                         Then again, the climax is upon us.

                                     BOZO
                              (re: Trampy's hair)
                         Ya know, that's not a bad look on 
                         you. Kinda 1985, but not bad. I'd 
                         hook it up.

                                     TRAMPY
                         I wouldn't fuck you for practice.

                                     BOZO
                         Tease.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Leave her alone.

                                     BOZO
                         Hey, cyclops. Let's have a quiet 
                         contest... starting now.

               Bozo turns his attention back to Trampy.

                                     BOZO
                         Ya know, in situations of duress, I 
                         have found that women are attracted 
                         to my authority.

               INT. BAR -- BASEMENT -- CONTINUOUS

               Heroine, Roadie, and Coach make their way through the 
               basement. Creeks and cracks with every step.

                                     ROADIE
                              (to Heroine)
                         You handle yourself pretty well. You 
                         a cop or a criminal?

                                     HEROINE
                         Neither. Just a farmer.

                                     ROADIE
                         Oh yeah? Then how do you do it?

                                     HEROINE
                         I just think about my husband and 
                         daughter... and the rest is easy.

               The light casts a shadow of something BEHIND THE CURTAIN.

               Roadie moves to open the curtain with his sawed-off barrel.

                                     HEROINE
                         Easy.

               WHIP! The curtain slides. It's a dried animal hide on a hook. 
               They all sigh. Roadie unblocks the tiny door.

               Heroine scans the room.

                                     ROADIE
                         This place is creepy in the daytime, 
                         too. Ready?

               Coach's hand shakes as he raises his weapon.

                                     ROADIE
                         Scared?

                                     COACH
                         No. You?

                                     ROADIE
                         Of course not. I fight monsters all 
                         the time.
                              (gripping the door)
                         On three.

               Roadie, Heroine raise their weapons.

                                     COACH
                         One... two... three!!!

               Roadie whips open the door. Nothing.

               BANG-GONG-GONG! Some pipes CRASH to the ground next to them... 
               they jump, but nothing is there. A LITTLE MOUSE emerges from 
               the fallen heap.

                                     COACH
                         Well, look at that.

               Coach leans down and puts out his hand. He smiles as Heroine 
               watches over his shoulder.

                                     COACH
                         Hey, little fella.

                                     HEROINE
                         Let's go.

               He leaves the mouse and follows Heroine to the tunnel.

               SLURP! A pink tongue LASSOS the mouse.

               A red fluorescent glow radiates from the tunnel. They all 
               drop in, one by one, entering the steamy, confined space.

               Tuffy stands by a far wall, looking through the planks for 
               movement. At the bar, Beer Guy makes MOLOTOV COCKTAILS.

               Bozo moves close, slaps Beer Guy's constructing hand.

               INT. TUNNEL -- NIGHT

               The tunnel is thin and no more than SIX FEET HIGH. Cherry 
               red fluorescent lights line the top of the tunnel and kneehigh 
               marijuana plants are along the ground soil. There are thick 
               pipes above the plants that work as a makeshift watering 
               system. There is about six inches of water on the floor.

                         accents. We both travel a lot. We

               Coach bites his lip, dying to say something.

                         It's just that this seems like the

                         You don't want the rag touching booze, 
                         that way you can hold it and ensure

               Bozo finishes the Molotov cocktail and grabs a beer.

                         Perfecto. What we should do, though, 
                         is put those peanut barrels to use.

                         can be ugly and hurtful.

               Bozo looks to Trampy, putting an arm around her shoulder.

                         Excuse me for being forward, but I'm 
                         curious about your dimensions.

               INT. TUNNEL -- NIGHT

               Roadie leads the way and glares at the opposite end. The 
               tunnel slightly curves, so he can't see the whole way down.

                                     ROADIE
                         Hold up. You hear something?

               A SCRATCHING sound is heard from above.

                                     ROADIE
                         They're trying to burrow through the 
                         tunnel walls.

                                     HEROINE
                         Move.

               The scratching sound increases, now heard from the far end 
               of the tunnel as well.

                                     COACH
                         Like moles these things.

               Then, Sister Beast #1 drops into the tunnel from the far 
               end.

               She charges. At the last second, Roadie spots her.

                                     ROADIE
                         Duck!

               Roadie and Coach duck into the water, but Heroine is unable 
               to avoid a thrust that knocks her back ten yards. Sister 
               Beast #1 lands and turns, surveying her prey. Roadie aims 
               his water-dripping gun, but Heroine rises and blocks his 
               shot.

                                     ROADIE
                         Stay down!

               From her knees, Heroine fires. BLAM-BLAM-BLAM! The three 
               shots push Sister Beast #1 backwards. Heroine rises, covered 
               in muddy water and bleeding from a cut across the face.

                                     HEROINE
                         Go! The bitch is mine!

               Roadie and Coach reluctantly turn, leaving Heroine to fend 
               with the Beast.

               Heroine charges. Hissing, Sister Beast #1 charges as well.

               Heroine pumps and fires. BOOM! Sister Beast spins, avoiding 
               the shot. Now too close, Heroine jams the Beast in the mouth 
               with the gun, knocking her back.

               Sister Beast #1 responds with a swipe and chomp on the arm.

               Heroine bats her away. Sister Beast #1 moves to the others.

                                     HEROINE
                         Look out!

               Roadie and Coach sprint until Sister Beast #2 BURSTS through 
               the tunnel walls, stopping Roadie and Coach in their tracks.

               Roadie fires his weapon, but it sparks and fizzles.

                                     ROADIE
                         The shells are wet!

               With the two Beasts closing in. The men are trapped. Coach 
               looks around, seeing a plan.

                                     COACH
                         Grab onto ceiling and get out of 
                         water!

                                     ROADIE
                         What?

                                     COACH
                         Do it!!!

               Grabbing onto the piping along the ceiling, Roadie pulls 
               himself from the water. Coach uses the machete to cut a power 
               cord from above. He grabs the exposed, sparking end.

                                     COACH
                              (to Heroine)
                         Get out of water!!!

               Heroine sees what he's doing, sprints back the way they came.

               As the two Beasts charge, Coach pulls himself out of the 
               water by holding onto the above piping. He's forced to wait 
               for Heroine to get out of the water.

               The second she does, he jams the cord into the water.

               ZAP! The conductive water sizzles. Sister Beast #1 and Sister 
               Beast #2 lock up and crash. ELECTROCUTION. Sparks and smoke 
               rises from their cooked bodies.

               Roadie and Coach look to each other, victorious. They begin 
               shimmying along the piping to the end of the tunnel.

               INT. TUNNEL/BASEMENT -- NIGHT

               Heroine looks back at the two men. She turns and reenters 
               the basement.

               GAH! Teen Beast drops in front of her, whacking her to the 
               floor. Heroine slides across the floor, but jumps up quickly. 
               Teen Beast cautiously moves in for the kill.

               Heroine raises her weapon.

                                     HEROINE
                         You fuck with my family. 
                              (aiming shotgun)
                         I fuck right back!

               Click -- out of ammo!

                                     HEROINE
                         Oh shit.

               Heroine THROWS the shotgun at him and pulls out the MACHETE.

               She rolls left and swings. Teen Beast loses two fingers.

               She swings again but gets whacked to the floor.

               Heroine rolls with the hit, grabs her shotgun, and dives 
               into the KEG ELEVATOR.

               She slams closed the door as Teen Beast regains its composure 
               and lunges. BAM! It CRASHES against the door.

               Roadie and Coach crawl to the platform by the exit.

               The two men climb up the ladder leading to the ground above.

               At the top, Roadie pushes off the plywood covering. The two 
               men peer into the night and spot the TRUCK.

               Beast is pulled down to the bottom. The keg elevator door 
               bursts open on impact.

               Heroine SLAMS into the ceiling, kicking and yelling.

               MAIN BAR

               Tuffy KNOCKS Adulterer's shotgun up, takes the gun, and rips 
               open the keg door. Heroine swings out.

               P.O.V. - Teen Beast is right behind her with mouth open and 
               ready to feed. Tuffy points her shotgun.

               BLAM! Teen lurches back, dropping back down the shaft.

               Tuffy slams the keg door shut. Heroine pants on the floor.

               Adulterer is down, winded.

                                     BOZO
                         Welcome back.

                                     HEROINE
                         F-f-fuck you.

                                     BARTENDER
                         What the hell happened?

                                     TUFFY
                         You okay?

                                     HEROINE
                         I think they made it.

               She turns to Adulterer, rigid.

                                     HEROINE
                         Stop trying to get people killed. It 
                         is getting very old.

               Adulterer nods, ashamed. Heroine looks around the bar. She 
               notices the peanut barrels on top of the bar. Two wooden 
               planks serve as track, leading straight for the side wall.

                                     HEROINE
                         What's this?

                                     BOZO
                         Ingenuity, baby. Ingenuity.

                                     HEROINE
                              (to Bartender)
                         I need some shells.

                                     BARTENDER
                         I have two left.

               Bartender expels a shell from The Judge and hands it over.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Make it count.

               Heroine cringes, eyeing the lined up Molotov cocktails.

                                     HEROINE
                         Let's prepare ourselves, they ought 
                         to be here with the truck any minute.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Bullshit.

               Boss Man sips a bottle, still hopped-up on morphine. He lazily 
               loads his pistol from a pool of bullets on his belly.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         If you ask me, I'm gonna just lay 
                         right here, wait for sunrise, then 
                         walk on out of here.

                                     HEROINE
                         That's your choice, but this is going 
                         to get a whole lot worse before it 
                         gets any better.

               Boss Man shrugs, content with himself.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         If all of you run for it, they won't 
                         care about lil ol' me. They like the 
                         food that moves...

               CRASH! Teen Beast's arm ERUPTS through the Boss Man's belly.

               His pistol and bullets scatter across the floor.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         OHHH!!!

               SNAPPP!!! His head and legs SLAP together as the arm pulls 
               him through a small hole in the floor.

               The group jumps back. Blood rockets out. His body is pureed 
               down the tiny hole.

                                     HEROINE
                         Get on the tables!!! On the tables!!!

               Everyone struggles to get on the tables.

               CRASH! Teen Beast's arm reaches up and GRABS Para's 
               wheelchair, violently shaking it. Para FALLS to the floor.

               Teen Beast's arm grabs Para's leg...

                                     PARA
                         HELP ME!!!

                                     BOZO
                         Bonsai!

               Bozo jumps from a table and STOMPS on Teen Beast's arm. He 
               picks up Para and TOSSES him onto a table.

                                     BOZO
                         Hot potato!!!

               Bozo leaps back onto a table. POP! The power cuts out. The 
               room goes black.

                                     BEER GUY
                         We're gonna die!

                                     ADULTERER
                         What the hell?!

                                     HEROINE
                         Settle down!

                                     TRAMPY
                         Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

               And with that, the shouting and pounding stops. The group 
               nervously shuffles around the tables.

               There's silence.

               Dead silence.

               Then, far is the distance, beyond the walls, a sound is heard. 
               It's screaming. And it's approaching. Rapidly. The survivors 
               maneuver to peek out the front walls.

                                     BARTENDER
                         What's that?

               Tuffy sees what is coming.

                                     TUFFY
                         They didn't make it.

               EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Being held by Papa and Momma Beast, Roadie and Coach are 
               both rushed towards the wall like human battering rams.

                                     ROADIE
                         RUN!!!

               THUD! The first strike causes the men to HOWL.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               The survivors shake in sickened silence. From beyond the 
               walls, they can hear high-pitched SCREAMS.

               THUD! THUD! THUD! With every strike, a splattering of blood 
               spits through the planks of wood.

                                     BARTENDER
                         That wall's coming down!

                                     BOZO
                         Commence Plan B!

               The entire group goes into motion.

                                     HEROINE
                         What's Plan B?

                                     BOZO
                         Just watch the floor and keep the 
                         others safe!

               THUD! THUD! THUD! With a final furious strike, a few wood 
               planks splinter. Papa Beast sticks in his head and hisses.

                                     BOZO
                         Bomb's away!!!

               From the bar, Beer Guy, Tuffy, and Adulterer release the 
               first peanut barrel. It's ablaze and sails straight for Papa 
               Beast. BLAM! It explodes, bursting open the wall and knocking 
               back Papa Beast. The wooden walls go up in flame.

               Para, on a side table, reaches out and grabs Boss Man's .38 
               from the floor.

               The second peanut barrel is released. It sails outside the 
               breach, but it doesn't explode. Nevertheless, the Beasts 
               stay far away.

               Teen Beast madly rips floor boards away, moving towards Para's 
               table. Teen Beast bursts through the floor, knocking Para to 
               the floor.

               Para crawls to his fallen wheelchair. Teen Beast spots him, 
               moves in to feed.

               Para points his seat back at the scattered .38 bullets and 
               flips the armrest switch. SNAP! The bullets jump to the power 
               magnet. Para yanks one free, loads the pistol and turns just 
               as Teen Beast strikes...

               POP! The shot hits Teen Beast in the eye, sending him back 
               down the hole in the floor.

               Heroine and Bartender move in. When Teen Beast sticks his 
               head out of the hole again, they thrust both their shotguns 
               into each ear.

                                     HEROINE
                         Now!

               BLAM-BLAM! The two shots scatter head everywhere.

               The flames in the bar spread, catching the entire wall and 
               roof on fire.

               EXT. BAR -- MOMENTS LATER

               The second barrel comes to a stop a good distance from the 
               bar. Suddenly, the top is knocked off. Trampy sticks her 
               head out.

               Seeing no trouble, she emerges, dizzy as hell, and races for 
               the nearby BEER TRUCK.

               INT. BAR -- MOMENTS LATER

               Papa and Momma Beast both charge the bar. The third peanut 
               barrel is released. It sails for them, but they dive out of 
               the way.

               KABLOOM! It takes out the rest of the wall. Fire and smoke 
               fills the place.

               Adulterer douses Momma Beast with booze as Beer Guy nails 
               her with a lit Molotov cocktail.

               WHOOSH! Engulfed in flame, she bolts from the bar shrieking.

                                     BOZO
                         One down, one to go!!!

               Papa enters and is instantly cornered. He swings wildly.

                                     HEROINE
                              (to Bartender)
                         Help me!

               Heroine and Bartender rip the DEER HEAD from the wall and 
               charge Papa, pinning him against the wall with the antlers.

                                     HEROINE
                         Come on!

               Bozo and Beer Guy dive into Papa's legs, holding them down.

               Tuffy picks up The Judge.

               WHAM! The shotgun butt knocks out Papa's front teeth. Tuffy 
               raises the weapon again, staring down at the monster that 
               killed her child, but Papa Beast gets an arm free to knock 
               away her fatal blow.

               Bartender wrenches Papa Beast's arm with all his might. With 
               her hair stuck in Papa Beast's claw, Tuffy is pulled face to 
               face with the beast. She squirms as he chomps at her, but 
               with no front teeth, he can't do immediate damage.

                                     BARTENDER
                         I can't hold him!!!

                                     HEROINE
                         Do something!!!

               Tuffy reaches back and shoves her fist into Papa Beast's 
               mouth, jamming it down his throat. He instantly gags, sucking 
               for air.

               Papa Beast struggles to get free, but the others hold tight.

               Papa Beast's body begins to quiver from a lack of oxygen.

               His eyes widen, face to face with Tuffy.

                                     TUFFY
                         CHOKE ON IT!!!

               With one last lunge, Papa Beast shakes, his life drifting 
               away. His eyes turn black as his body goes limp. Tuffy pulls 
               out her arm from his throat.

                                     BARTENDER
                         God...

                                     BOZO
                         I need to get your number.

               Tuffy shakes her wet arm dry. As the group pulls away, Papa 
               Beast is still pinned to the wall with the deer antlers dug 
               into the wood.

               Heroine turns to Grandma and Grandpa, offering a hand.

                                     HEROINE
                         Come on, I'll help you.

                                     GRANDPA
                         No thank you, we're content.

                                     HEROINE
                         I'm not leaving anyone behind.

                                     GRANDMA
                         Maybe next time, dear.

               Heroine swallows and nods. HONK-HONK-HONK! Just outside the 
               breached wall, the beer truck pulls up.

               EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               The beer truck screeches to a halt. Trampy's at the wheel, 
               waving the group over. With the bar burning, a thick layer 
               of SMOKE blankets the entire area.

               The people amass at the opening, but Heroine stops them from 
               advancing. The group stares the dark night. Silent.

                                     HEROINE
                         She's still out here.

               Heroine eyes the truck, seeing something she likes.

                                     HEROINE
                         Stay put.

               She creeps out alone.

                                     HEROINE
                         Where are you... come on...

               Nothing. Just smoke. And silence.

                                     HEROINE
                         Come on! Come on!

               From the smoke, a smoldering Momma Beast charges like a bull.

               At the truck, Heroine opens the back doors and dives in, 
               leaving the doors open. Momma Beast gives chase, entering 
               the back.

               INSIDE TRUCK

               Heroine is deep into the truck as Momma Beast enters. She 
               advances, hissing.

                                     HEROINE
                         Come and get me you blood-chugging 
                         CUNT!

               Momma howls and charges. Heroine slides out the side keg 
               door, locking it behind her. Before Momma can see the trap, 
               Beer Guy slam closed the rear doors.

               OUTSIDE TRUCK

               Beer Guy latches it. Trampy comes around the truck.

                                     TRAMPY
                         You got her? You got her!

                                     HEROINE
                         Not for long, we gotta burn it.

               Heroine looks to the others at the breach.

                                     HEROINE
                         Come on! Let's blow this thing!

               The others move into action. Beer Guy takes off his shirt 
               and shoves it into the fuel tank. Adulterer and Bozo, with 
               Para riding piggyback, help. They use the Molotov cocktails 
               to make a fuel trail leading away from the truck.

                                     BEER GUY
                         When this lights, run like hell.

               About fifteen yards away from the truck. Bozo throws his 
               silver-plated American Eagle lighter to Heroine.

                                     HEROINE
                              (catching lighter)
                         Here we go...

               Then, a noise: EOCH-OCK-OCK! EOCK-OCK-OCK! EOCK-OCK-OCK!

               A deafening pattern of sound erupts from within the truck.

               It's Momma Beast. Again and again.

                                     TUFFY
                         What is that?

                                     HEROINE
                         She's calling for help.

               Heroine drops the lighter onto the fuel. It races for the 
               truck. When feet away, COUSIN BEAST lands, stomping out the 
               fire with his foot.

                                     BOZO
                         The fan has officially been buried 
                         in the shit.

               Instantly, another beast, AUNT BEAST, lands on the top of 
               the truck. These Beasts are like the others, but stripped. 
               The group gasps. Trampy backs away.

                                     TRAMPY
                         We have to run --

               BURST! Trampy's rib cage is ripped from her body. The culprit, 
               UNCLE BEAST, stands behind her. Her organs drop like a box 
               of vegetables. Cousin Beast lets out a high-pitched roar. 
               From atop the truck, the rear doors are ripped open. Momma 
               Beast emerges.

                                     HEROINE
                         Get to your cars!!!

               The Beasts spring into action, chasing the group.

               Bozo, with Para on his back, sprints for his car. Aunt Beast 
               RIPS Para from Bozo's back.

                                     BOZO
                         Motherfucker! Give him back!

               Bozo runs for his Trans-Am. Para falls to the ground, still 
               alive. Bozo turns back and sees him.

                                     BOZO
                         Oh Jesus!

                                     PARA
                         HELLLPPP!

               Bozo grabs his brother and puts him on his back again, runs.

                                     BOZO
                         I thought we lost you --

               Para is RIPPED into the air again.

                                     BOZO
                         You FUCKER!

               Tuffy and Bartender jump into his PICKUP TRUCK.

                                     TUFFY
                              (to Heroine)
                         Get in!

               Heroine hops in the back.

               Beer Guy and Adulterer run to a car together. Beer Guy lags 
               behind, continually looking over his shoulder.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Run and quit looking back!

               As Beer Guy looks forward, Aunt Beast and Uncle Beast hit 
               him HIGH-AND-LOW, cutting him in half. Bozo makes it to his 
               Trans-Am.

                                     BOZO
                         DO IT!

               VAHVVVOOOMMMM! The car roars to life. He pushes in a tape.

               The "MIAMI VICE" theme song blares from the speakers.

                                     BOZO
                         Get me FUCK BIRDS!

               Bozo peels out. Aunt Beast lands right in his path.

                                     BOZO
                         No you don't!

               BAM! He SMACKS Aunt Beast head on, sending the creature's 
               disemboweled body sailing through the air.

                                     BOZO
                         VENGEANCE!

               Para DROPS from the sky, still ALIVE and panting. Cars are 
               moving everywhere.

                                     PARA
                         Oh Jesussss...

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               The burning JUKEBOX plays a slow love song. Dancing and 
               holding each other, Grandpa smooches Grandma on the forehead.

                                     GRANDPA
                         We had a good run.

               EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Para crawls along the ground, being ignored by the Beasts.

                                     PARA
                         HELP ME! HELP ME SOMEBODY!

               Bozo turns on his windshield wipers to clear off the blood 
               and guts. He spots Para.

                                     BOZO
                         Hang on!

               Para claws the ground.

                                     PARA
                         Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

               Bartender jerks the wheel of his car.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Oh shit!

               Para sees Bartender's approaching truck.

                                     PARA
                         NOOO!!!

               Para rolls right, just missing tires. Para yells for his 
               brother.

                                     PARA
                         COME ON! GODDAMN IT!

               Bozo's eyes bulge.

                                     BOZO
                         Brother!!!

               BAM! Para is SMEARED by Adulterer's car.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Shit!

               Bozo floors it.

                                     BOZO
                              (overly endearing)
                         I meant to tell you so much!

               The remaining cars maneuver to hit the open road.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Grandpa and Grandma hold each other tight. Uncle Beast enters, 
               moving to their table. It moves in for the kill.

               Grandpa kisses his wife gently.

                                     GRANDPA
                         Close your eyes, hon.

               The Beast OPENS its massive jaws and... CRASH! Bozo's car 
               DRIVES through the bar, SMEARING the Beast.

               INT. BOZO'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS

                                     BOZO
                         YOU ARE SUCKING MY DICK!!!

               Bozo guns the engine, crashing out the other end of the bar.

               EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Bozo's car veers, flipping over a pile of rubble.

                                     BOZO
                         Motherfucker!!!

               Bozo squirms in his flipped car, UPSIDE-DOWN.

               He hears a Beast approaching. He pulls out a BUTTERFLY KNIFE 
               from the open glove box and SAWS at his safety belt.

               Cousin Beast leans into the passenger side of the car and 
               looks him right in the eye. Bozo raises the knife.

                                     BOZO
                         Lord, if I die, bury me upside down 
                         so the world can KISS MY ASS!

               Cousin Beast leaps in.

               EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               The remaining TWO CARS race down the road.

               INT. BARTENDER'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS

               With the peddle to the floor, Bartender drives.

                                     BARTENDER
                         I think we're in the clear --

               BAM! Momma Beast lands on the roof. She reaches inside and 
               yanks out Bartender's throat. The car veers.

               Tuffy rights it, leaning over and stomping on the gas. Momma 
               yanks at the door, pulling it open. Tuffy pushes out 
               Bartender's corpse and JERKS the wheel.

               IN THE BACK

               Momma Beast falls back, knocking down Heroine. Momma Beast 
               nearly falls out, but manages to grab the rear gate with one 
               claw. Defenseless, Heroine backs away. Momma Beast holds on 
               tightly, pulling herself onto the bed of the truck.

               Tuffy stares back through the glass, unable to do anything.

               Momma Beast lunges towards Heroine. Momma Beast's claw snags 
               Heroine's locket, jerking Heroine right up to the creature's 
               face. The locket catches Momma's attention for split second.

               Her remaining eye goes from the picture of Charlie to Heroine.

               Momma's mouth opens wide. Heroine screams!

               And then, a beam of the RISING SUN catches the gold locket 
               and burns into Momma's eye. In one quick motion, she's gone, 
               taking the locket with her.

               Heroine lets out her breath, reaching around her neck for 
               what is no longer there. The truck SKIDS to a halt. Tuffy 
               jumps out.

                                     TUFFY
                         Are you okay?!

                                     HEROINE
                         I don't know, I think --

                                     ADULTERER (O.S.)
                         Hey!

               They both jump as Adulterer approaches.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Are you two all right? They left! We 
                         made it! I think we made it!

                                     TUFFY
                         They'll be back.

                                     HEROINE
                         We're safe until dark, but we need 
                         to find other people.

               Heroine rises and moves to the cab of the truck. She finds a 
               pack of cigs under the visor. Pops in the lighter.

                                     HEROINE
                         You know where the IGA grocery store 
                         is over in Red Mountain?

                                     ADULTERER
                         Um, yeah, ten miles west.

                                     HEROINE
                         They have a bomb shelter.

               PING! The lighter springs out, hot. Heroine lights up and 
               passes one to Tuffy.

                                     HEROINE
                         We'll meet in three hours?

                                     ADULTERER
                         I don't wanna go home alone... I 
                         don't wanna see what might have...

                                     TUFFY
                         Don't worry about that. Just go.

               Moment of silence as Adulterer and Tuffy look down the 
               desolate road.

                                     ADULTERER
                         I'm sorry about your son. I really 
                         am.

               Tuffy nods, affectionately touching his hand.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Where are you two going?

                                     HEROINE
                         We're going to get my little girl.

                                     ADULTERER
                         I wish you luck.

               The car peels off. Adulterer watches the car tear down the 
               road. He glances up at the RISING SUN.

               EXT. TOWN ROAD -- DAY

               A sign reading "RED MOUNTAIN" swings lazily in the breeze.

               Tuffy and Heroine coast down a town road. There are random 
               POOLS OF RED BLOOD in the dirt. No one in sight.

               EXT. TOWN ROAD -- DAY

               Adulterer drives along a small town road. There's no sign of 
               life here either.

               EXT. HEROINE'S GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE -- DAY

               The car pulls up to the house. The only sound is the wind.

               INT. BARTENDER'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Heroine and Tuffy look at each other and proceed with caution.

               INT. ADULTERER'S CAR -- DAY

               He pulls up in front of his house. The front door is swinging 
               open, BANGING against the door frame.

               INT. HEROINE'S GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE -- DAY

               Heroine enters the ransacked house. Tuffy follows.

               INT. ADULTERER'S HOUSE -- DAY

               He enters his house. It too, is a mess.

               INT. HEROINE'S GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE -- DAY

               They look down the stairs to the basement. Nothing. They 
               move up the stairs to the second floor.

               SECOND FLOOR

               SMACK! They spin to the noise.

               INT. ADULTERER'S HOUSE -- DAY

               He moves up the stairs to the master bedroom. SMACK!

               There's a noise at the end of the hall. SMACK!

               INT. HEROINE'S GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE -- DAY

               They cautiously move to the last room in the hall. A 
               scratched, closed door without an outside handle.

                                     HEROINE
                         Oh no...

               Heroine kicks in the door and...

               There's a note on a teddy beer that says, "WE WENT TO THE 
               SHELTER. LOVE GRANDMA AND CHARLIE."

                                     TUFFY
                         They're alive!

               The shudders SMACK against the wall.

               INT. ADULTERER'S HOUSE -- DAY

               Adulterer holds a shattered PICTURE of his wife and two kids.

               He sighs and puts it down.

                                     ADULTERER
                         I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...

               EXT. IGA (GROCERY STORE) -- DAY

               The sun shines bright in the cloudless sky. There is a stiff 
               wind that stirs up the dust. Bartender's car slowly lurches 
               up the street.

               INT. BARTENDER'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Heroine and Tuffy skeptically look at the surroundings.  

                                     HEROINE
                         It's right up there, in the back of 
                         the store.

               EXT. IGA (GROCERY STORE) -- CONTINUOUS

               The car pulls up in the back of the store and stops. They 
               get out, looking around. Tuffy holds a machete. Adulterer 
               kneels against his car.

                                     HEROINE
                         Where is everyone?

                                     ADULTERER
                         I don't know, I just got here. Did 
                         you find your girl?

                                     HEROINE
                         She's supposed to already be here.

                                     TUFFY
                         Your family?

               Adulterer shakes his head, acknowledging their death.

                                     TUFFY
                         I'm sorry.

               Adulterer sheepishly nods.

                                     HEROINE
                         This place is a ghost town.

               The group makes their way to the store front, peeking beyond 
               the glass doors.

                                     ADULTERER
                              (pointing)
                         Look!

               In the distance, in middle of a dusty parking lot, CHARLIE 
               stands staring at them.

                                     HEROINE
                         Charlie?

               Heroine runs to her and the others follow. Charlie fidgets 
               awkwardly. She cries and blood stains her dress.

                                     HEROINE
                         Charlie!

               As Heroine nears, Adulterer GRABS her arm.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Stop! There's something wrong!

                                     HEROINE
                         Honey!?

               The group eyes Charlie, noticing Heroine's locket around her 
               ankle, leading to a slightly ajar manhole cover. Suddenly, 
               the sunlight starts to FADE. They look up the sun.

                                     TUFFY
                         Oh god.

               The MOON moves in front of it -- a SOLAR ECLIPSE. Beast 
               HISSING and FLUTTERING is heard. Heroine looks from left to 
               right, panic stricken.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Mommy!

               The sunlight is fading. The manhole cover shakes, something 
               is holding Charlie in place. Heroine lurches forward, but 
               Adulterer holds her at bay.

                                     ADULTERER
                         It's a trap!

               At a standstill, the group looks around for options. In the 
               distance, the darkness of the eclipse rolls towards them.

               Adulterer reacts, grabbing Tuffy's machete and lunging for 
               Charlie. The strike cuts the chain at her ankle. The manhole 
               cover POPS off and a Beast claw sinks into Adulterer.

               The darkness covers the manhole. Momma Beast rises, hoisting 
               Adulterer's blood dripping body from the ground.

                                     ADULTERER
                              (gurgling blood)
                         Run!!!

               Heroine scoops up her child, moving away from Momma Beast.

               Tuffy grabs them both, leading them back towards the store 
               front. As Adulterer's blood flows, Momma Beast drags him 
               towards her main prey. 

               A blanket of darkness leads Momma Beast, overtaking the 
               survivors. At the store front, Heroine pulls Charlie close. 

                                     HEROINE
                              (a whisper)
                         I love you...

                                                              CUT TO BLACK:

               EXT. IGA (GROCERY STORE) -- AN HOUR LATER

               A string of ten WHITE VANS come to a halt in the dusty parking 
               lot. THE MAN IN TAN (45, buzz cut, leathery skin, cool) steps 
               from the lead van and surveys the ravaged small town.

               A swarm of men emerge from the other vehicles, all dressed 
               alike in work boots, gas masks and coveralls. They go into 
               action honing in on rubble with SENSORS and COUNTERS.

                                     THE MAN IN TAN
                         What's the damage radius?

                                     THE MAN IN TAN
                         How many picked up the broadcast?

               The Man in Tan closes his eyes in thought.

                         Sir, what's the spin?

                         Get what you need to sell it.

                                     COMPANY MAN (O.S.)
                         Sir, we have movement!

               The Man in Tan moves to a few men standing over a pool of 
               blood and guts. Using the sensor equipment, the COMPANY MAN 
               follows the blood trail that enters the grocery store.

               INT. IGA (GROCERY STORE) -- CONTINUOUS

               The place is torn to hell. Dust and soot hangs in the air.

               The men instinctively raise their high-powered rifles, letting 
               the flashlights on the ends lead the way. They follow the 
               trail of blood to a back FREEZER LOCKER.

               It's scratched, bashed and thrashed.

                                     THE MAN IN TAN
                         Open it.

               Company Man #2 steps forward and uses a metal-cutting chainsaw 
               to cut through the hinges. The door falls with a THUD.

               As the dust clears, Tuffy, Heroine and Charlie stare back at 
               the men, huddled together in a defensive stance.

               The Man in Tan creaks his neck.

                                     THE MAN IN TAN
                         Gentlemen, help them to safety.

               Heroine, holding Charlie, lurches back.

                                     HEROINE
                         You're not safe, she's still alive, 
                         she'll be back...

                                     THE MAN IN TAN
                         Relax. We know. We're the calvary.

               The Man in Tan steps forward, guiding the group out.

               EXT. IGA (GROCERY STORE) -- MOMENTS LATER

               A bulky security truck pulls up. A DRIVER, holding a bloody 
               rag to his nose, gets out and moves to the back door.

                                     THE MAN IN TAN
                         What happened to you?

               The Driver nods to the back of the truck, opening the door.

               Bozo lurches out, handcuffed and chained.

                                     BOZO
                         Get these cuffs off me! I'm a goddamn 
                         hero for Christ's sake!

               A shirtless, irate BOZO sits next to Grandpa and Grandma in 
               the back. He settles at the sight of the others.

                                     GRANDMA
                         G'morning.

                                     BOZO
                         Thanks for waitin' for me back there, 
                         really fuckin' appreciate it!

               Heroine covers her daughter's ears as the survivors are helped 
               into the truck. Tuffy sits, looking to Bozo.

                                     TUFFY
                         How'd you survive?

                                     BOZO
                         I found a new weak spot on 'em, but 
                         it damn ain't pretty getting to it.

               Heroine, last in the truck, turns to the men.

                                     HEROINE
                         Where are you taking us?

                                     THE MAN IN TAN
                         A trauma center. We have doctors 
                         waiting.
                              (off Heroine's pause)
                         You're in good hands now.

               The door shuts on Heroine's concerned face. The Man in Tan 
               locks eyes with the Driver.

                                     THE MAN IN TAN
                         Do it quick and spread the mess.

               The Driver nods back. Sinister implication understood.

               The Man in Tan lights a cigarette as he watches the truck 
               drive off. The truck's logo reads, "FARM-AID." He inhales.

               Freeze on him.

               NAME: THE MAN IN TAN 
               AGE: 45 
               OCCUPATION: HE CAN'T TELL YOU 
               PURPOSE: TO LAY GROUNDWORK FOR SEQUEL 
               LIFE EXPECTANCY: PRETTY F-ING GOOD

               The Man in Tan exhales a gust of smoke.

                                                                  FADE OUT:
