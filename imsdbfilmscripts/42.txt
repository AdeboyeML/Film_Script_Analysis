          The big Birmingham Black Barons CATCHER behind the plate as
          Kansas City Monarchs JOHN SCOTT stands at bat. The catcher's
          attention on the RUNNER DANCING off first. Stomping a foot,
          feinting, hard to see clearly in the glare of the lights.

                         CATCHER
          Where'd you learn to move like
          that, runner?! At dime a dance
          night?! Stay quiet!
          INSERT: Birmingham, Alabama. April 8, 1945. 
          On the first pitch the runner takes off. The catcher fires to
          second. See it from his POV as the runner slides in âSAFE!â
          A foot on the bag, the runner dusts off, heckles the catcher:

                         RUNNER
          Is that the best you got?! Huh?!
          I'm going to steal nine, ten bases
          today! You better start counting!

          Shaking his head, the catcher gets back in his crouch,
          signals the PITCHER. On the wind-up, the Runner is off
          again. The catcher fires to THIRD: âSafe!â

          Well California here he goes, if he
          comes down here.
          The Catcher gets back down in his squat. Signals the
          pitcher: fastball. Scott digs in, ready. The runner dancing
          off third. Here comes the wind-up...
          The Runner takes off even as the pitcher fires it in. The
          Birmingham Catcher receives it. As the Runner slides --
          The Catcher intentionally drives his glove, the ball and both
          hands into the runner's face -- WHALLOP! Sound drops as
          we're knocked flat senseless along with the runner.
          ON HIM now as he tries to push himself up from the dirt. A
          close look at JACK ROOSEVELT ROBINSON. A born battler, he
          shakes out the cobwebs, finally lurches to his feet, looks to
          the UMPIRE. He never heard the call.

                         JACK
          What was I?
          The umpire passes one hand over the other: Safe. Jack looks
          over at the catcher, gives him a pointed look as he goes --
          The catcher shoves him in the back. Jack turns, shoves back.
          As the two men wrestles each other to the ground --

          Blinds closed. Jack sits across the desk from Rickey.
          Sukeforth sits a little further back. Rickey is staring at
          Jack. Bushy eyebrows flared, light gleams off his glasses.
          INSERT: August 28, 1945. Brooklyn. 
          Jack doesn't know what to do, looks to Sukeforth. Finally...

                         RICKEY 
          Do you have a girl?

                         JACK
          Excuse me?

                         RICKEY
          A man needs a family relying on
          him. It insures he'll behave
          responsibly. Do you have a girl?

                         JACK
          I think so.

                         RICKEY
          You think so?
          Jack looks to Sukeforth who smiles placidly. Back to Rickey.

                         JACK
          I don't make much money. Between
          the army and now baseball I've been
          away a lot. And Rae, Rachel, she
          wants to finish school. Considering
          all that, I say I think so.

                         RICKEY
          Do you love her? Rachel?

                         (JACK CONFUSED)
          Don't you know?

                         JACK
          Yes, sir, very much.

                         RICKEY
          Marry her.
          What? Rickey stands, walks to a window. Jack looks at
          Sukeforth who raises a hand as if to say: Give it a chance.

          RICKEY (CONT'D)
          Baseball's a hard life; a man needs
          a good woman by his side. You
          don't want the only person waiting
          for you at home to be a catcher.
          Sukeforth chuckles at that. Rickey fingers open a slat on
          the blind and peers out. Jack looks hard at him.

                         JACK
          Coach Sukeforth here said you were
          starting a new Negro League. That
          doesn't make sense to me.

          MR. RICKEY
          It doesn't, huh? Are you calling
          us liars, Jack?

                         JACK
          What's this about, Mr. Rickey?

                         RICKEY
          This is about baseball.
          Rickey opens the shade. Sunlight floods in. Rickey follows
          it to the chalkboard, to the list of players under Montreal.

          RICKEY (CONT'D)
          I see you starting in the spring
          with our affiliate in Montreal. If
          you make it there, we'll try you
          down here with the Dodgers. The
          white Brooklyn Dodgers.
          Jack looks to Sukeforth who nods: Yes, you heard right.

          I'll pay you $600 a month and a
          $3,500 bonus when you sign the
          contract. Is that agreeable?
          Believe it or not that's a lot of money to Jack on this day
          in time. This is all becoming a bit overwhelming.

                         JACK
          Yes, sir. That's fine.

                         RICKEY
          There is one condition. I have a
          pile of scouting reports. I know
          you can hit behind the runner, that
          you can read a pitch. The question
          is can you control your temper?

                         JACK
          My temper?

                         RICKEY
          Yes your temper! Are you deaf?! 
          Rickey furious, the avuncular old man gone. Jack sits there, 
          fists now balled. Rickey to Sukeforth like he's not there: 

          RICKEY (CONT'D)
          He looks proud. Willful. 

                         SUKEFORTH
          He'll need to be.
          Rickey looks back to Jack who is as angry as he is confused.

                         RICKEY
          I want to win! I want ballplayers
          who can win! Are you one of them?!

          Yes.

          A black man in white baseball.
          Imagine the reaction. The vitriol.
          Rickey strides forward, gets in his face.

          The team stops at a restaurant.
          The waiter won't take your order.

          Didn't you see the sign on the

                         JACK

                         (MASTERS HIMSELF)
          Do you want a ballplayer who
          doesn't have the guts to fight
          back? Is that what you want?

                         RICKEY
          I want one who has the guts not to
          fight back! There are people who
          will not like this. They will do
          anything to get you to react. If
          you echo a curse with a curse, they
          will only hear yours. Follow a
          blow with a blow and they will say
          a Negro lost his temper; that the
          Negro does not belong. Your enemy
          will be out in force, but you can
          not meet him on his own low ground.
          We win with hitting, running and
          fielding, nothing else. We win if
          the world is convinced of two
          things: that you are a fine
          gentlemen and a great ballplayer.
          Like our Savior, you must have the
          guts to turn the other cheek.
          Jack considers Rickey. Rickey looks worn out.

          RICKEY (CONT'D)
          Can you do it?
          Jack poised at what will be his Rubicon. He crosses.

          Pop Lloyd.

          Wagner is number two. And Rabbit

          He won't break it. He doesn't have
          a shortstop's arm. Robinson
          belongs on second base.

          Alright then, where would he rate
          at second?

          I spoke to the Daytona mayor. He
          assures me there'll be no trouble.
          But Rickey doesn't sound so sure. They consider each other.

          RICKEY (CONT'D)
          Mr. Smith, are you a Communist?

                         SMITH
          I'm a Democrat. Why do you ask?

                         RICKEY
          I have a business proposition.
          What's your salary at the Courier?

                         SMITH
          Fifty dollars a week.

                         RICKEY
          I will pay you an additional fifty
          dollars a week plus expenses if you
          will attend spring training with
          Jackie Robinson. You will watch
          over him, help him to avoid the
          harm that could come if he were to
          do or say anything out of turn.
          You will act as his chauffeur, you
          will secure accommodations for him
          wherever the team may be, help him
          find restaurants, etc...

                         SMITH
          What's in it for me? Besides the
          fifty dollars and a whole lot of
          aggravation?

          Unprecedented access for any
          reportage you feel appropriate.
          What do you say, Mr. Smith?

                         SMITH
          I say yes, sir. If a Negro is good
          enough to stop a Nazi bullet in
          France; he's good enough to stop a
          line drive at Yankee Stadium.

          agree. The world is ready.

          As our former President Herbert
          Hoover remarked in his tribute to
          our national pastime: âThe rigid
          voluntary rules of right and wrong,
          as applied in baseball, are second
          only to religion in strengthening
          the morals of the American people.'

          Jack swinging two bats to get loose. Watches as the Montreal
          BATTER hits a LINE DRIVE which -- Pee Wee Reese nearly leaps
          out of his socks to bring down. Wow...
          As the CROWD claps in appreciation, Jack takes a deep breath.

                         PA ANNOUNCER
          Now batting the second baseman --
          Jackie Robinson!
          Jack wincing as he steps forward to both cheers and boos from
          the white sections. As a âgo home, coon' drifts over -- A
          BIG OVATION from the black section in right drowns it out.

          COLORED SECTION - RIGHT FIELD 
          Rachel sits with Smith. They react to some of the INVECTIVE 
          coming from the white section. 

                         RACHEL 
          Jack's got a thick skin. He'll be 
          okay.

          Higbe watching from the mound as Jack steps into the batter's
          box. Two well wishing voices from the infield stands.

                         SPECTATOR ONE
          Come on, black boy, you can make

                         SPECTATOR TWO
          They're giving you a chance! Do
          something about it!
          Jack heartened at the words. Concentrates as Higbe's first
          pitch is fired. High and tight, Jack jerks out of the way.

          Here comes the next pitch. Even tighter. Jack nearly hit.

                         UMPIRE
          Ball two!
          Jack glaring, crowds the plate more. Bragan shows 1, taps
          his right thigh signalling outside. Jack watches it sail,
          doesn't bite. The umpire: âBall Three!â Higbe's fun
          slipping away as he can't find the strike zone.

                         HIGBE
          Come on, Rook! Ain't you gonna
          swing at something?!
          Jack takes a practice swing, waits as Bragan sets up right
          over the plate. Here comes the pitch. Low. âBall four!â

          Looks ill-tempered over to first where Jack gives the same

          bag. Higbe incredulous. Did he just do that?

          Higbe gets the ball back, settles. Jack takes a lead, but a 
          modest one this time. Here come the pitch -- And Jack goes.
          You knew he was fast; but not this fast. Bragan's throw to 
          Pee Wee is late and high. Pee Wee throws back to Higbe. 
          Higbe sets. Bragan gives him a sign. Jack takes a lead. On 
          the wind-up, Jack goes. Bragan stands -- it's a PITCH OUT. 
          Bragan fires to third and Jack is caught in a RUN DOWN. It 
          seems like half the team gets involved with Higbe finally 
          getting the ball by third and Jack ducking under the tag. 
          Safe! A BUZZ goes through the stadium now as people start to 
          realize they are not watching something or someone ordinary.

                         HIGBE & JACK
          Higbe looks home for the sign, Jack dancing off third, 
          pounding his right foot toward home. He feints hard home. 
          Higbe steps off the rubber. Jack stays where he is. 

                         HIGBE
          Hell! You're supposed to go back
          to third when I step off! Don't
          you know nothing?!
          He throws over. Jack back to the bag. Higbe gets the ball
          back, looks in. Jack bouncing, pounding off third. His 
          movements carry violence within them. Like a piston 
          exploding in an engine. 
          Higbe into his motion, stops his delivery, accidentally drops 
          the ball to the ground. The umpire signals BALK, points Jack
          home. Higbe is furious.

          can't start toward home and then
          stop. Jackie scores.

          Montreal vs. Indianapolis. THE STANDS are half filled. The

          empty seats in the sections on either side of it.
          INSERT: De Land, Florida.
          No score, top of the first as -- Jack drops a BUNT down the
          line. The FIRST BASEMAN fields, throw to the SECOND BASEMAN
          covering. Too late. Only Jack doesn't stop.
          Realizing the SHORTSTOP isn't covering the bag, Jack bolts
          for second. The second baseman has to wait on the throw and
          when he makes it -- The UMPIRE signals safe. A bunt double!
          Spider Jorgensen settles in the batter's box. The pitch.
          Crack, Jorgensen laces a single to left.
          Jack motors to third where Sukeforth is WAVING him home.
          We're with him at hip level as he tears down the basepath.
          The CATCHER bracing for the throw - they COLLIDE - he's SAFE! 
          As Jack gets to his feet, however, a Jim Crow POLICEMAN steps
          up to meet him, grabs him by the shoulder.

          name. Casey signs with a flourish. Casey holds out the pen
          to Walker who doesn't take it right away. An odd beat.

          Recently, the thought has occurred
          to me that a change of ball clubs
          would benefit both the Brooklyn
          Baseball Club and myself.

          Southern upbringing, that you would
          have to subordinate your feelings
          for the welfare of this venture. I
          for one would deeply appreciate it.
          I think we can all learn something.

          What I have, Mr. Rickey, is a
          hardware store back home. It's
          called Dixie Walker's. Folks don't
          come because I have the lowest
          prices, they come because it's

                         BARBER
          One out in the bottom of the first.
          Headed toward the plate for his
          first big league at bat is Dodger
          rookie Jackie Robinson. Jackie is
          very definitely brunette.

                         114 JACK 114
          Walks toward the plate. More cheers. Mostly.

                         FAN #2
          Hey, boy, how about a shine?!
          Jack struggles not to look back at the source of the jeer.
          He settles in at the plate. JOHNNY SAIN on the mound waiting
          for the sign. The crowd BUZZING.

          BARBER'S VOICE
          Sain looking in. When he's got
          that fastball working, he can toss
          a lamb chop past a hungry wolf.
          The BRAVES CATCHER signals â1'. Here come the pitch. CRACK!
          It's down the third base line.
          The THIRD BASEMAN is going to need every ounce of his arm as
          he fields it at the line, throw across his body to --
          FIRST. Where Jack's foot hits the bag an instant before the
          ball smacks into the first baseman's mitt.

          Jack can't believe it. As he trots toward the dugout he
          looks at the umpire who looks back: I dare you to complain.

                         STANDS
          As the Brooklyn faithful BOO the call, Rachel and Smith watch
          Jack head decisively toward the dugout. He was safe.
          Rickey sits down closer to the dugout.

                         RICKEY
          It's a game of inches, Jackie!

          Burt. Another season is underway.

                         SHOTTON
          Yeah, it's a shame about Leo.

                         RICKEY
          Inevitable I suppose. I asked him
          if she was worth it and he said
          yes. How's the retirement?

                         SHOTTON 
          It's fine. The roses -- 

                         RICKEY 
          It's a helluva thing when a man has 
          good health and enough money and
          absolutely nothing to do.

                         SHOTTON

          When I took off that Cleveland 
          uniform two years ago, I promised
          the Mrs. I'd never put on another
          uniform again. Roses look great 
          and I sleep a whole lot better. 

                         RICKEY

          No, I'm sorry, but no. 

                         RICKEY 
          Do you miss the game, Burt? Look 
          me in the eye and tell me you 
          don't. 
          Shotton considers Rickey a beat and then looks away. 

                         SHOTTON
          Baseball's the only life for an old 
          pepper pot like me, but I promised 
          my wife, Branch.

                         RICKEY
          You promised her you wouldn't put
          on another uniform. You didn't
          promise her you wouldn't manage.

                         SHOTTON
          Men, I don't have much to say.
          Just, don't be afraid of old Burt
          Shotton as a manager. You can win
          the pennant in spite of me. I can
          not possibly hurt you.
          The Dodgers trade looks. Not exactly inspirational. As
          Shotton heads out he pauses by Jack.

          forkful of food to his mouth before a MENU and a PEN are
          offered for an autograph. As he signs, a FLASH BULB goes
          off. In a lull, Jack cuts his steak, low to Rachel.

          doing this with a sick sort of glee.

          Grips the bat. Watches for the next pitch with bloody
          mindedness. He hacks at it, lofts a routine fly into left.
          He's about halfway down to first when the left fielder
          catches it and Jack can mercifully return to the dugout.

          Jack sits down. No one says anything to him. No one comes
          near him as he stares ahead, trapped in a kind of void. The
          closest player to him is Bobby Bragan. Bragan finally
          manages to glance over at him, then looks quickly away.

          wincing, wondering if it's going to start again.

          is ashamed. Dixie tries to look disinterested. Stanky and
          Reese exchange a helpless glance as Jack continues into:

          He proceeds to turn his bat into SPLINTERS. Concrete chips,
          wood flies. Jack drops the handle of the bat, pounds his
          fists. Heaving for breath, framed by the empty tunnel. Raw,
          electric, ungovernable. All the anger on display, the fury.
          FEET SCRAPE. Jack looks up to see Rickey standing there,
          watching, afraid to get too much closer.

                         JACK
          To hell with this. The next white

          pokes a soft hit past second. A nothing hit, but he's
          standing on first. And he looks, well, ferocious in fact.
          As Pete Reiser steps up into the batter's box...
          Jack stares at Dutch Leonard. Assassin's eyes as he takes an
          insolent, in-your-face lead off first.
          Dutch fires to first. Jack dives back safe!
          Back on his feet, he spits out a piece of grit he picked up

          Robinson, who is pitched to a great
          deal that way, uses a thicker

          I could run as fast as you can.

          No matter how fast you run, you'll
          never hit as much as you weigh.
          Garagiola signals for another fastball.

          Munger throws inside.
          Jack falls back, strokes a double into the gap.

          I saw him at a UCLA football game.
          Even in uniform with a helmet on,
          his vanity was awful. It was the

                         (RICKEY LAUGHS)
          And on campus he always wore crisp
          white shirts and I'd think his skin
          is so dark, why would he do that?
          Then I got to know him, his pride
          and confidence, and I realized he
          was showing off his color. I was
          wrong. He wasn't conceited; he was 
          proud. Always, of who and what he

          Yes. I have to let him have that
          silence at first, let him come to
          me. But he opens up eventually.

                         RICKEY
          Good. It's too much to carry
          inside. Does he have any friends

          No one can take their eyes off him.

                         RACHEL
          He's had himself on trial since the

          himself or gets to himself worse

          Herbert, what your team does is
          your decision. But my team is
          coming to Philadelphia. With
          Robinson. If we have to claim the
          game as a forfeit, we will. That's
          9-0 in case you forgot.

          stitched up for Pete's sake.
          The reporters move off for other interviews. Reporter Two
          hesitant to let it go, finally drifts off. Rickey watches.

          Sticking up for yourself is what
          you'd expect of any man. Some find
          it galling to see it in a Negro.

          We had victory over fascism in
          Germany; it's time for victory over

          Why are you doing this? Come on

          A long moment between them. Finally, Rickey looks away.

                         RICKEY
          I love this game. I love baseball.
          I've given my life to it. Forty
          odd years ago I was a player coach
          at Ohio Wesleyan University. We
          had a Negro catcher, best hitter on
          the team. Charley Thomas.
          Rickey starts slowly rubbing the baseball in his hands.

                         RICKEY
          A fine young man. I saw him laid
          low. Broken because of the color
          of his skin and I didn't do enough
          to help. I told myself I did, but
          I didn't. The game I loved had
          something unfair at the heart of
          it. I ignored it. But a time came
          when I could no longer do that.

                         (LOOKS UP)
          You let me love baseball again.

           from one house to the next. In a gap, a passing car picks it

          A very big game today here in

          Every year in April, all MLB players wear the number 42 as a
