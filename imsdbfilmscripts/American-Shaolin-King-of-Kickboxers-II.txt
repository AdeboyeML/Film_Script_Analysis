ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THE NEW YORK CITY SKYLINE AT NIGHT, THE LIGHTS
OF THE CITY SHINING BRIGHTLY.
EXT. WORKOUT AREA ­ SAME NIGHT
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF MASTER KWAN'S SCHOOL, A RAMSHACKLE BUILDING IN A
BURNED OUT ROW OF STORES.
His is the only one still    occupied, and it doesn't look that
permanent. In the window    is a cardboard, handwritten sign that reads
"Kwan's Shaolin Kung Fu".    What remains visible behind the poster and
the security grate is an    IMPRESSION of people moving and milling
around.
INT. WORKOUT AREA ­ SAME NIGHT

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF KWAN'S SHAOLIN KUNG FU SCHOOL.

The students are doing their own thing, and they are a mixture of old
and young, men and women. They are not dressed alike, as they would
be in a Karate school: they are dressed in old T-shirts and tattered
sweat pants. This is not a wealthy school, by any means, and that is
typified by the appearance of SIFU KWAN, who is walking through the
students as they train. He is wizened old man, 70 years old if he is
a day, and he is dressed in a fraying Chinese jacket, scruffy cloth
shoes and a discolored Chinese T-shirt.

ANGLE ON A YOUNG ADULT

Struggling through a horse stance, his face in real pain. He is
trying his best to hold the stance, but his legs are quivering. He
drops out of the stance onto his knees. Master Kwan is right beside
him.

                     YOUNG ADULT

           Sifu Kwan, was that long enough? It's been 10 minutes...

Sifu Kwan shakes his head and puts his hands behind his back as he
walks past the student.
                     KWAN
           At Shaolin Temple, in misty Songshan mountains, We monks
           trained in iron palm until our hands bled...
                   (beat)

           ... then we trained some more.
He walks on, leaving a puzzled student behind.
                     YOUNG ADULT
                   (getting back into horse stance)
           I guess not...

ANGLE ON KWAN
As he walks around the different people training. As one woman is
moving through an intricate series of movements, he sighs and
rearranges her hands.
                       KWAN
              Tiger grasps his tail, not hamburger!
He    moves on, studying the room with his eyes, often glancing toward
the    door, and then toward the small clock on a table near the door.
It    is late, and Kwan is obviously waiting for someone to arrive. As
he    is waiting, a young STUDENT comes up to Kwan.
                       STUDENT
              Master Kwan, when can I learn flying kicks? I see Bruce
              Lee...

                       KWAN

              Bruce Lee actor, we fighters, warriors. A sparrow in
              flight is beautiful, but a side kick to the ribs is
              effective. Show me.

The boy shrugs    and then    starts throwing side kicks. Kwan   is half
looking at the    boy and    half looking towards the door and   the clock.
The boy throws    three or    four kicks and then stops. He is   watching
Kwan watching    the door.    Kwan sees him, and turns back to   him.

                       KWAN (CONT'D)

                    (shaking his head)

              A Shaolin warrior lets nothing intrude. Continue, never
              mind.

He continues to kick, and Kwan continues to look at the door.
Finally, the student stops kicking, half-heartedly bows to the
master, and then moves to the side of the workout room. Kwan doesn't
know he's gone. Kwan turns around, forgetting for a moment what he is
doing, and comes face to face with the mother of a student, MRS.
RODRIGUEZ, and she is holding a uniform of some sort. She smiles
widely at him and holds up the uniform. It is beautiful, obviously
hand made, and on the back is embroidered: "Kwan's Shaolin" and
underneath that is "Drew Carson". Kwan takes in the entire outfit,
while the rest of the class is gathering around to have a look. They
are all very impressed.

                       KWAN (CONT'D)
              Never in my days at the Shaolin Temple have I seen
              uniform as beautiful as this. Thank you, Mrs. Rodriguez.
              I wish Drew were here to thank you himself. Ta ma de!
This last he says looking at the empty door.
                       MOTHER

              I only hope it brings him luck in the tournament.

                    KWAN
           Luck is no concern, Mrs. Rodriguez. Shaolin warriors
           depend on heart and soul ­ that's how they saved the
           T'ang emporer.
He looks again at the door, then claps his hands together, gathering
his students around him.
                    KWAN (CONT'D)
           Xie Xie, Mrs. Rodriguez.
                  (to class)
During my time training at the Shaolin Temple, the birthplace of the
martial arts, I was lucky (glance at Mrs. Rodriguez)... er...
fortunate to have the best instructors in the world train me. But,
there was also time for individual training ­ where skills were honed
like the blade of a sword. Now, it is that time for you.

He turns to go.

One of the students, before he can leave, clears his throat.

                    STUDENT 2

           What do you want us to do?

                    KWAN

           When the blind follow the blind, they both fall over the
           cliff. Understand?

                    STUDENT 2

           No.

The others mutter "No" and shake their heads, confused.

                    KWAN

           No matter.
He exits, leaving his students staring vacantly after him.

They look at each other, honestly not knowing what to do.
EXT. DREW GARAGE ­ SAME NIGHT
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF OLD GARAGE.

It is kind of spooky, and there are no lights on outside. There is
candlelight inside, and it is moving around ­ an effect not unlike a
ghost carrying a candelabra.

INT. DREW GARAGE ­ SAME NIGHT
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF INTERIOR.
The area is dilapidated, but very clean, with all kinds of kung fu
and Chinese paraphenalia lying around. Around the corner comes the
spooky light, and (with music building to a crescendo), we see DREW

CARSON, a    muscular 16/17 year old, bowls of flaming wax on his bare
shoulders,    moving through the garage, practicing his kung fu
maneuvers.    He is kicking, punching, etc., occasionally spilling hot
wax on his    skin (INSERT).
In the background is a TV, and on it is showing a martial arts movie.
ANGLE ON KWAN
Who is quietly settling into a shadowy corner of the garage, watching
Drew.
ANGLE ON DREW
As he continues to move around the workout area, his arms and body
moving as he tries to match the movements on the TV.
Suddenly, Kwan jumps out of the shadows, attacking. Drew reacts
instantly, evading the attack, the wax sloshing around in the bowls
but not spilling (INSERT SHOT HERE). Kwan continues the attack, and
Drew evades, their movements matching the movements on the TV almost
move for move. It is a beautiful ballet, and Drew ends it by sweeping
Kwan down to the ground. When Kwan hits the ground, hard, his face is
lit by the TV screen.

ANGLE ON DREW

Who, for the first time, sees that it is Kwan.

                       DREW

              MASTER KWAN!

He hurries over to his master, a concerned look on his face.

He leans down to help Kwan up, forgetting about the bowls of hot wax.
It pours down on Kwan, scalding him, as well as running down Drew's
chest. Kwan struggles to get up, while at the same time trying to
wipe the hot wax off.

                       DREW (CONT'D)

              Master Kwan! I'm sorry, very sorry!

                       KWAN
                    (blustering)

              I'm OK, never mind! What are you doing anyway?
DREW
Is taking the glued-on cups of wax off his shoulders, while peeling
the already hard wax off his chest.

                       DREW
              Practicing. I saw it in this movie...
Kwan shakes his head and walks over to Drew, standing in front of
him.
                       KWAN

           Why didn't you come to class? Why waste time with this...
           Should study tapes of opponent.
                      DREW
           I'll still win. Besides, the Shaolin monks never had
           tapes to study... they did it this way... right?
                      KWAN
           Not quite ­ our drills at the temple had meaning. If we
           had tapes, we would have watched them.
Drew starts to protest, but Kwan doesn't even let him start.
                      KWAN (CONT'D)
           "The    warrior who knows himself and his opponent will win
           100    times in 100 battles." Study the tapes I gave you.
           All    these years of one on one training ­ you're the best
           I've    ever taught.

                      DREW

           The best?

                      KWAN

           Best white boy, maybe. Just fight like a Shaolin warrior
           ­ the rest will take care of itself.

                   (picks up tape)

           Face reality, before it breaks your jaw!

Drew holds out his hand for the tape, and Kwan slaps it into his
hand. Drew smiles a defeated smile and turns toward the VCR, when
Drew's stepfather, BOB, walks in. He is a big, overweight man, and he
is very angry.

                      BOB

                   (shouting)
           Are you screwing around with this stuff again?

                      DREW
           Look, Bob, I'm not bothering you, am I?
                      BOB

           It's your attitude that bothers me, son.
                      DREW
           I'm not your son, Bob. Lay off.
It is a threat, one that Bob almost takes up. Kwan feels the tension
in the room, and starts to say something.
                      BOB

                 (cutting him off)
           Don't say a word, yellow man.
REACTION SHOT OF KWAN
Closing his already opened mouth.
                    BOB (CONT'D)
           You're here because I told your Mom I'd see you were
           taken care of... after. At least respect my wishes, and
           make something of yourself... Stop wasting your time!
                    DREW
                 (sarcastic)
           When I'm the best fighter in the country, I'm not going
           to let you be part of my entourage...

                    BOB

           You mean when you're in jail...

                    DREW

           Just leave me alone, Bob, OK? I NEVER asked for anything
           from you.

He spins and kicks one of the hanging bags, then walks out of the
workout room, leaving Bob and Kwan standing alone.

Kwan looks at Bob, who towers over him, and smiles sheepishly.

                    KWAN

           Pressure. Big tournament this weekend.

He starts to walk out, but Bob follows him.

                    BOB

           How would you have liked having to take care of a kid you
           never really wanted... ?
                    KWAN
           I wish I had the chance...

Kwan exits, and we...
EXT. TREVOR ESTATE ­ DAY
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TREVOR GOTTITALL ESTATE, A HUGE PALATIAL SPREAD.

The grounds are immaculate and huge, exquisitely kept and beautifully
laid out. A gathering is around the pool and lawn area, where TREVOR
and his team are having an exhibition for their guests. Polite
applause is
COMING FROM THE CROWD, ALL WELL-DRESSED AND OBVIOUSLY WELL-HEELED.

ANGLE ON TREVOR
As he knocks out an opponent.
ANGLE ON CROWD
Applauding.
ANGLE ON TREVOR
Taunting a different opponent. Trevor executes a beautiful technique
and puts the guy down and out.
ANGLE ON TEAM
(Psychologist, therapist, masseur, etc.) who are cheering Trevor on.
ANGLE ON TREVOR
As he plays with the next fighter.

                         TREVOR

              They said you were good... ha!

He knocks the guy out with a picture perfect kick. There is no
denying that he's a superior fighter.

                         TREVOR (CONT'D)

              Can't you get me any quality sparring partners?

The next guy comes up, but before they can start, the psychologist,
DR. PFEELGUT, calls for "Time" and motions Trevor over.

                         PFEELGUT

              It's    not enough just to win, Trevor. You have to destroy
              your    opponent completely, mentally and physically. Beat
              him    once, he's a threat. Humiliate him, and he'll fear
              you    forever.

Trevor listens to this, nods his head once, and when Pfeelgut goes to
leave, Trevor pushes him into the pool.
Pfeelgut comes to the surface, smiling.
                         PFEELGUT (CONT'D)
              Exactly!
Trevor goes back to the ring. He really takes it      to this guy,
alternately playing with him and hurting him. As      the guy tries to
hold his own, the string to his pants comes loose      and they start to
fall down. He grabs for them with both hands, and      Trevor starts to
back up, laughing with the rest of the group.

ANGLE ON PFEELGUT
Toweling off, who is yelling to Trevor.
                         PFEELGUT (CONT'D)

           GET HIM! NOW!!
Trevor looks at him for a moment, not really understanding, then sees
what the psychologist is saying. He lunges immediately forward and
(in SLOW MOTION) knocks the guy out while he is still trying to pull
his pants up.
ANGLE ON CROWD AS THEY ENJOY THE SHOW IMMENSELY
Trevor has learned the lesson of the day, and he walks off.
INT. TREVOR HOUSE ­ SAME DAY
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TREVOR BEING PAMPERED BY HIS ENTOURAGE
The masseur is massaging his shoulders, a woman is doing a pedicure
and another is doing a manicure. An exercise physiologist is going
over a computer print out with Trevor, when an old Korean master,
MASTER KIM, comes into the room.

                    TREVOR

           Ah, Master Kim.

                 (to physiologist)

           I'll look at these stats later.

Trevor indicates a seat near him, much lower than the one he is
sitting in. The Korean master prefers to remain standing.

                    TREVOR (CONT'D)

           Are all you guys named Kim? So, what did you think?

                    KIM

                 (thick accent)

           You velly good fighter...

                    TREVOR (CONT'D)
           Learn English, will ya? And, tell me something I don't
           know...
                    KIM

           A mountain lion doesn't ponder his weakness, and is
           therefore vulnerable.
                    TREVOR
                 (after a beat)

           Well, I'm pretty damn tired of this fortune cookie crap.
                 (beat)
           You're history. Chaunce, get ride of the bum.

The butler, CHAUNCY, comes forward and walks up to Master Kim.

                      CHAUNCY
           Very good, sir.
                      TREVOR
           Don't come here any more, you hear? Over a little more to
           the left, Sam.
The masseur nods and adjusts his technique accordingly.
                      TREVOR (CONT'D)
           It's hard being me, you know. So much pressure...
EXT. COLISEUM ­ DAY
People are streaming into the large building. The marquee out front
reads "Diamond Nationals".

INT. COLISEUM ­ SAME DAY

ESTABLISHING MONTAGE OF TOURNAMENT: CROWDS AND COMPETITORS.

(SOME IDEAS, NOT IN ORDER)

Competitors warming up (wall front stretch, very high; one guy
kicking another in the head ­ tap, tap, tap; two man routine
practicing ­ another one jumps in?; two beautiful girls sparring;
crowd assembling; group of kids waiting ­ call comes over public
address system, they run off; stand outside selling high tech
equipment; different styles of fighter's clothes ­ camo, stars &
stripes, "headhunter"; stern 9 year old girl doing kata; two toddlers
barely seen through their safety equipment fighting furiously; two
twins doing identical kata; breaking; etc.)

ANGLE ON DREW AND KWAN

Walk into the area ­ Drew is dressed in the ill-fitting handmade suit
by Mrs. Rodriguez. People recognize him as he walks past.

ANGLE ON TREVOR
Making his entrance. He is in a perfectly laundered and pressed suit,
and his assistant is carrying another suit pressed and ready to go.
                      COMPETITOR

           Hey, Trevor! What's the 2nd uniform for?
                      TREVOR
           The finals.
                      COMPETITOR

           Cocky bastard...
ANGLE ON TREVOR

As he wins a fight.
ANGLE ON DREW
As he wins.
ANGLE ON TREVOR
Drew watching, as he wins again.
DREW AGAIN
Winning. The stage is set for the finals.
ANGLE ON THE RING
Drew and Trevor are already inside, waiting. Drew fights in a mish
mosh of gear (different colors, different makes), while Trevor is
decked out in designer, personalized gear.

                      ANNOUNCER

              Fighting for the Grand Championship: Trevor Gottitall and
              Drew Carson. 3 rounds, max point. Gentlemen, bow to the
              ref, to each other...

The referee gives them a signal and the fight begins. Drew is holding
his own, but Trevor is scoring. After several flashy moves, the round
is over.

Score: 6 - 1. We see Trevor's cheerleaders cheering.

ANGLE ON TREVOR'S CORNER

Where he is given mineral water to drink, his shoulders are massaged,
etc.

ANGLE ON DREW'S CORNER

Kwan sheepishly offers him a sip of water from a battered paper cup.

2nd round: Drew's getting beaten worse than the first round. Nothing
he tries works. The score at the end of the round is 15 - 4, in favor
of Trevor.
ROUNDBREAK

Drew is exhausted, frustrated and worried. Trevor is pumped and ready
to go on forever.
                      KWAN
              You only lose if you give up.

ANGLE ON TREVOR'S CORNER
The psychologist is exhorting him to destroy Drew. Trevor leans back
on his padded stool, smiling.
The 3rd round starts. In this round, Trevor is destroying Drew,
making him look ridiculous. A clinch comes, and
(INSERT HERE) before they can break, Trevor grabs the drawstring

around Drew's waist and pulls.
They face off ("20 seconds" comes the call), and Trevor charges. As
Drew blocks, his pants begin to sag. Trevor, not trying to score,
just trying to keep Drew's hands busy, keeps coming.
Drew's pants drop lower and lower.
When they get around his knees, he finally notices them, and reaches
down to get them. Trevor drives and picks him up in a throw,
effectively showing Drew's bare ass to the world.
CUT AWAY to crowd laughing, girls shocked, cameras poised and
recording, one mom puts her hands over her daughter's eyes, etc.
Trevor dumps Drew and scores the final point, just as time runs out.
A buzzer goes off, signaling the end of the round.
Trevor thrusts his fists into the air in celebration. Drew tries to
crawl out of the ring, and everyone is watching him.

           I was never worried. He's no match for me. I just hope
           the 2nd place trophy is a belt!

Crowd laughs, Trevor's entourage laughs the hardest.

ANGLE ON DREW

EXT. NEW YORK BRIDGE ­ NIGHT

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW AND KWAN WALKING ALONG A BRIDGE, THE ENTIRE
NEW YORK NIGHT SKYLINE IN THE B.G.
They are not talking, they are just walking, Drew kicking a can and
contemplating the future, and the past.
INT. KWAN HOUSE ­ SAME NIGHT

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF SMOKING ACUPUNCTURE NEEDLE, ITS TIP EMBEDDED IN
DREW'S FOREARM.

Kwan's hand COMES INTO FRAME and flicks the needle, sending it
vibrating back and forth.
CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL Drew sitting at the table in Kwan's
house, the acupuncture needle in his arm and his face pensive and
sad. Kwan busies himself around the needle, trying to alleviate the
pain of Drew's bruises.
                    KWAN

           Next time we get that guy...
                    DREW
                 (shaking his head)
           No next time, Master. Maybe...
                 (big sigh)
           ... you should find a new student. I just can't do it ­
           I'm not getting any better!
                    KWAN (CONT'D)
           Don't talk like that. At Shaolin...
He pauses, and decides not to tell another Shaolin Temple story. Drew
looks at him funny ­ this is very against his character.

                    KWAN (CONT'D)

           I saw a Shaolin monk once. I was only 5 years old at the
           time, but I remember it like it was yesterday. I was
           coming back from the market with my father. Soldiers
           stopped us and were taking the food we had just bought.
           It was all we had left to eat ­ no more money. These were
           hard times in China, people were selling their children
           for food, and the soldiers had no right. Who can stop
           soldiers with guns, though? Yes?

He pauses, and takes a sip of tea, checking the needle, adjusting it
and turning it slightly this way and that.

                    KWAN (CONT'D)

           Just as the soldiers were leaving, a monk stepped out of
           the crowd and told them very calmly to put the food back.
           Well, naturally, they didn't. They pushed the monk, and
           the next thing I knew the soldiers were in the street,
           and the food was back in my father's arms. 5 soldiers,
           and they were in a heap on the ground, their blood mixing
           with the dust of the street.

Kwan smiles with the memory ­ it is a sweet and heroic one.
                    KWAN (CONT'D)
           The crowd whispered "Shaolin", and he bowed to us,
           touched my cheek and smiled, then just walked on. I
           watched him until he disappeared in the distance. He was
           larger than life, a hero to a little boy of 5. I vowed
           then and there to become like him, fight for right like
           the Shaolin.
He pauses again, looking at Drew. Drew meets his gaze, wondering why
he is telling him this story.

                    KWAN (CONT'D)
           I never did, though. My family left China and ended up
           here in New York, a young boy's dream left behind in

           China.
                     DREW
           You mean... all the stories...?
                     KWAN
                   (nodding)
           Made up. I never trained at the Shaolin Temple. When I
           realized my dream couldn't come true, I convinced myself
           that it had anyway. It was a small step to convince other
           people.
                     DREW
           Why are you telling me this?
                     KWAN

           I've given you all I can, and it's not enough. It was
           never enough. You're like a son to me, Drew, and you have
           all the potential in the world, but I can't take you
           where you want to go.

Kwan takes the needle out of Drew's arm, and then rubs the spot where
it was with a cotton ball.

                     KWAN (CONT'D)

           There, that should control the swelling.

He watches Drew, who is pondering what Kwan has said.

                     DREW

           So you're not a Shaolin?

                     KWAN

           No.

                     DREW
           Never were?

                     KWAN
           No.
Drew nods, an idea forming in his head. A slight smile forms on his
face. Kwan was expecting him to be angry, he never expected this.

                     KWAN (CONT'D)
           What?
                     DREW

           If you are not a Shaolin warrior, then I will become one.
                     KWAN

           What are you talking about?
                       DREW
           I'm going to the Shaolin Temple ­ they can train me so I
           will never lose like that again.
Kwan feels Drew's forehead. A long beat here as Kwan studies Drew's
eyes.
                       KWAN
           He hit you so hard, you're delirious. I'll get a cold
           cloth.
He starts to get up, but Drew grabs his arm and forces him back down.
                       DREW
                 (eyes intent)

           Don't you    see? You said    yourself I needed the right
           training ­    where better    than the Shaolin Temple? What's
           holding me    here? I have    the chance to do what you
           couldn't.    I will go to    the Shaolin Temple.

Kwan looks at him, realizes he's serious. He nods his head, giving
the idea serious consideration. He smiles along with Drew.

                       KWAN

           I must pay for your ticket...

                       DREW

           No! I'll make it there myself.

                       KWAN

           I grew up on the stories of the Shaolin, and you can be
           those stories. You can live my dream for me ­ at least
           let me help you. Let an old man make up for the trouble
           he's caused.
Kwan touches Drew's bruised cheek, fatherly love in his eyes. Drew
nods his head, then bows in the traditional Chinese manner.
                       DREW
           Master...

EXT. CHANG AN LU ­ DAY
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW RUNNING ALONG BEIJING'S CHANG AN LU, A SEA

Bicycle bells ring loudly as figures dressed in the same drab clothes
ride around him, their faces covered with scarves and surgical masks
against the northern China dirt.
CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL TIAN AN MEN SQUARE and the huge photo of
CHAIRMAN MAO on the front of the Meridian Gate of the Forbidden City.
Drew continues his run, past a group of western-dressed lyou mang,
who watch him run by through dark glasses.
Drew runs through a large city park, stopping to watch a group of
older citizens going through Tai Zhi routines under the weeping
willow trees there.

Drew runs through an open air food market, picking his way through
flipping fish, dead frogs and all kinds of fruits and vegetables.
People yell at each other, trying to get the best price. Young man
brushing his teeth in the street. A group of toddlers, strung
together with rope, walks down the street, their split pants showing
glimpses of bare bottoms as they walk.

EXT. TRAIN STATION ­ SAME DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF SERIOUSLY OVERCROWDED TRAIN, PEOPLE PUSHING AND
SHOVING TO GET ON.

Drew walks up to it, a huge backpack on his back. He hesitates a
moment, then starts forcing his way onto the train like everyone
else. He manages to get in through a window.

INT. CROWDED TRAIN ­ SAME DAY

There are no seats. Drew takes his pack off and sits on it.

Next to him is an old man, his teeth red and rotted from betel nut
juice. The man smiles at Drew.

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW GETTING OFF THE TRAIN.
He stops on the platform for a moment, a huge colorful Chinese
billboard in the b.g. A transit cop quickly comes up to him and prods
him into motion. Drew walks on, passing a sign that reads "Luoyang".
EXT. CHINESE STREETS ­ DAY
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW MAKING HIS WAY TOWARD THE SHAOLIN TEMPLE.
He stops at    a drink stand and orders one. As soon as he stops, he is
ringed with    people watching his every move ­ he feels almost like a
movie star.    The woman in the stand hands him a drink, and takes the
money out of    his hand.
                       DREW
           Where is the Shaolin Temple? Shaolin?

The woman just smiles and shakes her head, not comprehending.

ANGLE ON DREW

Walking aimlessly. He comes to an intersection and sees a sign that
says "Shaolin Temple" with an arrow. He goes in the direction that
the arrow points.

EXT. GIRL'S SCHOOL ­ SAME DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF GROUP OF GIRLS STANDING OUTSIDE THEIR SCHOOL.

Drew walks up and says hello.

                       DREW

           Hello, ladies! Can you tell me how to get to the Shaolin
           Temple?

They titter with laughter, covering their mouths with their hands.
Drew is not really amused, however, he is frustrated and tired.

                       DREW (CONT'D)
           The Shaolin Temple? How hard can that be? Geez, doesn't
           anyone speak English here?
ANGLE ON ASHEMA
As she pushes her way to the front of the group. She is a strikingly
beautiful young woman.
                       ASHEMA
           I do. But wouldn't it make more sense for you to speak
           Chinese than to expect us to speak English?
                       DREW
                    (flustered)

           You're right. I apologize ­ I've just been trying to get

           to the temple for a long time now.
                     ASHEMA
           Why do you want to find the temple?
                     DREW
                 (not without pride)
           I am going to join the temple as a monk.
Ashema translates this for her friends, and they titter anew. They
gesture to Drew's longish hair and laugh, and then make some attempts
at martial arts movements.
                     ASHEMA (CONT'D)
           I'm going that way ­ I can take you.

                     DREW

           You have a car?

                     ASHEMA

           The next best thing.

                 (beat)

           This is a Chinese car.

She pulls out her standard-issue black bicycle ­ she has customized
it, however, with some colorful additions.

                     ASHEMA (CONT'D)

           Hop on.

Drew does, and they take off, the girls from the school tittering as
they drive off.

It is not the most stable ride ­ Ashema is struggling to keep moving,

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW PEDALING ASHEMA.

He is riding strongly, and she is comfortable in the back. They are
getting stares from the people they pass, but Ashema seems to be
enjoying the attention. Drew hits a bump, and Ashema holds his waist
a little tighter. Neither of them mind ­ in fact, Drew starts looking
for more bumps.
He pulls around the corner into a wide area lined with drink and food
stands.

                     ASHEMA
           We are here.
DREW STOPS THE BIKE AND LOOKS BACK AT HER. ASHEMA GESTURES TO THE
TEMPLE FRONT, AND DREW TURNS IN AWE.
EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ SAME DAY
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THE TEMPLE.
This is it ­ the temple he came halfway around the world to see. The
Shaolin Temple, the birthplace of the martial arts.
                     DREW
           Whoa!
Ashema climbs off the back and takes the bike from Drew, marveling at
his awe-struck face.

                     ASHEMA

           I have to help my grandfather with our stand. If you get
           a chance, come by later.

                     DREW

                   (distracted)

           I'll try, but monks aren't allowed to be around girls.

                     ASHEMA

           Good luck.

                     DREW

           Shaolin monks don't need luck...

                   (beat)

           Hey, thanks a lot for the ride. I hope I see you again.
They wave at each other, and Ashema pushes her bike off.

Drew turns back to stare at the front of the temple. He is letting it
all sink in.

After a moment, he picks up his backpack and heads for the front
door. He pulls it open and disappears inside.
INT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ SAME DAY
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TEMPLE INTERIOR AS DREW OPENS THE HEAVY DOOR.

The muted half light inside is in direct contrast to the sunlight of
the day outside. Drew quietly closes the front door, and the half
light takes over.
He walks through the temple proper, and what follows is a MONTAGE of
temple shots, establishing the feeling of the

temple:    the famous Shaolin monk painting, the depressions in the
floor of    the training hall, the incense blackened walls of the
temple,    the temple figurines, the red lanterns hanging from the
ceiling,    a huge wooden carving of
Bodhidharma, etc.
No one is around.
Drew continues to explore, looking for someone to talk to. He wanders
into another hall, following the O.S. sounds of CHANTING.
Once inside this hall, he sees a group of monks, amid hanging incense
burners and paper lanterns, sitting down on the floor chanting in
rhythm. No one notices that Drew is standing there. The monks eyes
are open, but they don't seem to see him.
He stands there for a moment, then shrugs and walks out of that hall.
He goes into a corridor, then passes the "Wooden Man Chamber".

HE STICKS HIS HEAD IN, AND SEES ALL KINDS OF WOODEN STATUES LINED UP.
HE ALMOST STARTS IN, BUT IS DISTRACTED BY THE SOUNDS OF TRAINING
OUTSIDE (O.S.). HE WALKS OUT IN SEARCH OF THE SOUNDS.

EXT. TRAINING AREA ­ SAME DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TRAINING AREA.

All manner of training equipment is standing outside (wooden men,
posts, hanging targets, heavy bags, iron palm jugs, balance beams,
etc.).

A monk, the DRILL SERGEANT (hereafter D.S.), is standing in front of
a wooden post, driving his hand into the wood.

The post TREMBLES with every strike.

Drew stands next to the monk, watching him intently. Again, the monk
takes no notice of him.

                       DREW

              Excuse me, Master.
No answer.
                       DREW (CONT'D)

              Hello? Busy, huh?
Still no answer. The man is just slamming his hand into the post,
over and over.
Drew sighs and walks on. He goes down a path, and flowering bushes
are on either side of him. He can see the "pagoda forest" in the
distance. At the end of the path, a monk, SAN DE, is sweeping up the
path.
Drew walks up to the monk and bows.
                       DREW (CONT'D)

           Master, may I ask you a question?
No answer nor response. Drew's kind of tired of this treatment.
                    DREW (CONT'D)
           What's the deal here? Is everybody deaf in this temple?
           Even if you heard me, you wouldn't understand, would you?
           Huh, baldy? Shine your head for a quarter?
He walks off frustrated, wondering what he has to do to get noticed.
He walks back into the chanting chamber.
INT. TEMPLE ­ SAME DAY
The monks are still chanting. Drew stands there, listening some more,
moving with the beat, until they stop chanting.
Drew, thinking it was some kind of performance, claps his hands.

                    DREW

           That was great! Great!

The monks finally take notice of him, and they are shocked.

                    MONK 1

           No tourists! Temple closed!

                    DREW

           So you can see me?!?

Several monks rush up and start herding Drew towards the exit.

                    MONK 1

                 (very agitated)

           No tourists! No tourists!

Drew stops their progress and makes sure he has the monk's attention.
                    DREW (CONT'D)

           I'm not a tourist! I want to be a monk!
The monk stops, his face a mask of shock. He calls to another monk,
and they have a short conversation in Chinese.
                    ADMISSIONS MONK
           That's not possible.
                    DREW
           What do you mean, sir?

                    ADMISSIONS MONK
           The training is too difficult. Besides, Shaolin policy is
           no foreigners.

                     DREW
             I didn't come all this way, from America, to get turned
             away. I want in. I want to become a Shaolin monk.
                     ADMISSIONS MONK
             What people want and what they can have are often not the
             same.
                     DREW
             Not in this case.
                     MONK
             Oh, yes, especially in this case.
                     DREW

             I'm not leaving.

Drew starts to sit down, intent on staying, almost like a kid who is
going to hold his breath until he turns blue.

                     MONK

             You give me no choice.

                  (to other monks)

             Remove him.

He continues in a stream of Chinese, and the other monks grab Drew
and physically force him to stand up and start moving him towards the
door.

                     DREW

             I just want to be a monk!

Drew is forced through the courtyard to the front door.

They pass the monk who was sweeping up in the back of the temple. He
watches with interest as they open the door and force Drew through
it, out of the temple.
He smiles.

EXT. SHAOLIN COURTYARD ­ SAME DAY
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW LANDING ON THE FLAGSTONES OF THE COURTYARD
WITH A THUMP!

A group of people stop and watch the foreigner. The temple door
closes with a solid boom.

                     DREW
             Hey! What about my...

The temple door opens again, and out comes Drew's backpack.
It lands next to him, but spews out a couple of pairs of underwear,
and some socks.
The people standing around laugh.
Drew gathers up the clothing and stuffs it back into his pack. He
sits there for a moment, then gets up and heads for the small shops
and stands ringing the courtyard.
He walks past a couple of the stalls, looking at the people running
them. He doesn't see Ashema. He passes a tea stall, where one old man
is sitting down sipping his tea.
The old man looks at Drew and smiles, and Drew is about to walk on,
when Ashema stands up from where she was squatting behind her stall.
                    ASHEMA

           Drew?

                    DREW

           Hi.

Drew sits down heavily, putting his pack down next to him.

Ashema places a cup of tea down in front of him, the steam rising
from it.

                    DREW (CONT'D)

           Make it a double. Rough day.

                    ASHEMA

           What happened?

                    DREW

           They kicked me out...

EXT. TEMPLE STAND ­ EVENING
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW, ASHEMA AND OLD MAN, STILL SITTING AT THE
TABLE, NOW LIT BY CANDLES AND A LANTERN.
A bunch of tea bowls are scattered in front of Drew, as if he's been
drinking heavily. He points to his teacup, and Ashema shakes her
head.
                    ASHEMA
           You've had enough.

Drew's shoulders slump even more.
                    ASHEMA (CONT'D)
           Maybe it's for the best, Drew. You belong in America. New

           York.
                      DREW
           I have to do this. I can't go home, not until I'm a monk.
           I'd be even more of a disgrace...
The old man talks to Ashema for the first time. He chatters in
Chinese, motioning towards Drew.
                      ASHEMA
           Not now, Bau Bau.
                      DREW
           Bau Bau?
                      ASHEMA

           My nickname for him. He wants to tell you a story about
           the temple.

The grandfather keeps talking, even though Ashema and Drew really
don't want to listen.

                      ASHEMA (CONT'D)

           He is telling a story about a monk who was refused
           admission into the temple. It broke his heart not to be
           allowed to be a monk.

                      DREW

           What did he do?

Ashema says something to him, and he continues in Chinese.

                      ASHEMA

           He decided not to leave. He stayed in the courtyard until
           they let him in.

                      DREW
           How long?
                      ASHEMA
           A long time ­ through the worst weather. He just sat
           there, unmoving, through rain, sleet, snow.
                      DREW
           Did they let him in?

                      ASHEMA
           No.
                   (beat)
           Of course they did ­ what kind of story do you think my

           Bau Bau would tell? He stayed in front of the temple
           until they could no longer say no. He went on to become
           one of the most famous monks in the history of the
           temple.
Drew sits there, thinking, letting it all soak in. He then gets up
and smiles.
                     DREW
           Please tell your grandfather, your Bau Bau, he is a wise
           man. And that he tells a good story.
The grandfather smiles at him, nodding his head.
                     ASHEMA
           What are you going to do? Are you going home?
Drew shakes his head.

                     DREW

           I'm camping out.

He starts away from the stand.

                     DREW (CONT'D)

           In front of the temple.

He walks off into the Chinese night.

EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ EARLY MORN

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF MIST-LADEN COURTYARD.

The sun is barely coming up, and only a few shafts of light are
illuminating the darkness. A figure can be seen sitting cross-legged
in front of the door.

It is Drew, backpack at his side.
The front door opens and a monk pokes his head out to look around,
and he sees Drew sitting there. His eyes widen in shock, then he
quickly disappears inside.
Almost immediately, the door opens again, and the Admissions Monk is
standing there, surprised and angry to see Drew sitting there.
                     ADMISSIONS MONK

           Go home! You cannot stay here!
No response from Drew. He just sits there, staring straight ahead.
                     ADMISSIONS MONK (CONT'D)

           Do you hear me? Go away!
Drew doesn't move.
San De, the sweeping monk, walks out of the open door, a monk behind

him carrying a suitcase. He walks past Drew, noticing him sitting
there. He walks on.
The Admissions Monk slams the door, angry.
EXT. TEMPLE ­ MONTAGE SECTION
ANGLE ON DREW SWEATING IN THE HOT SUNSHINE
Sweat is running into Drew's eyes, and he is trying to keep them from
stinging.
ANGLE ON DREW BEING TORMENTED BY LOCAL KIDS
They are playing games around him, throwing stones at him, messing
with his hair and his clothes, touching the things in his backpack
(frisbee, football, walkman), etc.
ANGLE ON DRILL SERGEANT

As he comes out of the temple, chasing away the kids.

When they are gone, he turns to Drew.

                    DRILL SERGEANT

           Will you give up? I think so.

ANGLE ON DREW SHIVERING IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT

His eyes are closed, and it is obvious he is very uncomfortable.

ANGLE ON SPIDER AS IT CRAWLS OUT TO SEE DREW

It lingers for a moment, then goes away.

ANGLE ON DREW BEING FED BY ASHEMA

She is giving him food, and all he is moving is his mouth. They do
not speak.

ANGLE ON DREW SITTING IN THE RAIN

He is miserable, and he is looking at the relative comfort of the
stands around the temple, where there is food, warmth and light. His
spirit is wavering.

ANGLE ON DREW BEING FED BY ASHEMA AGAIN
                    ASHEMA
           Give this up, Drew! Please?

No response from Drew. Just a small smile.
ANGLE ON SPIDER, WHO IS BACK
This time it stays even longer. Drew looks down at it and smiles.
ANGLE ON MONKS FROM TEMPLE
Looking out the windows at the crazy foreigner in their courtyard.

ANGLE ON DREW IN COURTYARD
As a school group comes through the temple.
The children are tied together with a rope, and the teacher motions
to the crazy American. Drew has become an attraction!
ANGLE ON DREW, SURROUNDED BY OLD MEN
They are marveling at his perserverance.
ANGLE ON DREW, WIND AND RAIN
This time it doesn't seem to bother him so much.
ANGLE ON DREW WITH ASHEMA AND HER BAU BAU THERE
Bau Bau speaks quickly in Chinese.
                       ASHEMA (CONT'D)

              My Bau Bau says, keep it up! He is proud of you...

Drew nods.

ANGLE ON DREW SURROUNDED BY KIDS

They are no longer tormenting him, they are playing around and with
him. Drew is not moving, but he is part of their group.

ANGLE ON DREW, THE SPIDER NOW SITTING ON HIS HAND

Drew stares at the spider, his companion in the vigil.

ANGLE ON DREW, BIRDS ALL AROUND HIM

The birds are keeping him company, and they are singing for him.

ANGLE ON DREW, THE FULL MOON IN THE B.G.

Drew's form is firm and solid, the determination in his eyes easily
seen as he stares at the moon. He will see this through.
EXT. TEMPLE ­ DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW STILL SITTING IN THE COURTYARD.
The    old monk, San De, comes back, the same monk following behind him
with    the suitcase. He looks at Drew, a little surprise showing in his
face    at seeing the American still there. He doesn't stop, though. He
goes    into the temple, shaking his head.

ANGLE ON DREW
Same as the first shot, all alone in the temple.

EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ SAME DAY
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF COURTYARD, DREW ALL ALONE.
The door to the temple opens and out comes San De, alone this time.

He walks over to where Drew is, stares at him for a moment, then sits
down across from him.
Drew tries not to look at him.
San De runs his hand across his bald pate and smiles.
                    SAN DE
           My head is shiny enough already, don't you think?
Drew, in shock at his ability to speak English, sputters
                    DREW
           You... You speak English? I'm sorry, I was just
           goofing... I apologize, master. I didn't mean to make fun
           of you...
San De shrugs it off. Apology accepted.

                    SAN DE

           What are you trying to do?

                    DREW

           I want to become a monk ­ they won't let me in... Hey,
           you're just a grunt, a janitor sweeping up and all, don't
           sweat it. It's not your problem...

                    SAN DE

           Why are you sitting here?

                    DREW

           I got the idea from a story about a monk who wouldn't
           leave. I thought...

San De nods.

                    SAN DE

           Has it been hard?
                    DREW
           It was at first. I was uncomfortable, in pain, actually,
           but as time went on, I got... into it, I guess. The
           sacrifice made me feel... in control, you know what I
           mean?
                    SAN DE
                 (nodding)

           Much of the training at the temple is in that direction ­
           self sacrifice. Tell me more.

                    DREW
           At first I was really bored, and very lonely. But then,

           things changed. Maybe it's like hitting the wall in
           running ­ it was like I became part of the courtyard, and
           I felt powerful. Even the spider became my friend...
Drew opens up his hand to reveal a spider sitting in his palm.
                    DREW (CONT'D)
           It was an incredible experience ­ I said I'd do it, and I
           did it.
San De, watching Drew intently, smiles at this last. He stands up and
bows to Drew. Drew bows back, from his seated position.
                    SAN DE
           I wish you all the best.
                    DREW

           Same to you.

San De turns and goes into the temple, leaving Drew still sitting in
the courtyard, the setting sun in the b.g.

EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF COURTYARD, DREW ALL ALONE.

O.S. comes the sounds of gongs and drums.

A crowd has gathered in the courtyard. Ashema and her grandfather are
in the crowd, and they work themselves up to where Drew is.

Drew turns his head, and a procession of kids about his age (some
older and some younger) come walking into the courtyard.

The front door to the temple opens wide, and a column of monks, all
in their best saffron robes, are lined up waiting to receive them.

The young men who are walking in all still have hair, and they are
carrying some baggage. They begin to enter the temple.

                    ASHEMA
           They are disciples. This is the last class for fighting
           monks at Shaolin.
Drew, very concerned, watches as the monks-to-be file through the
temple doors.
The mothers and fathers of the boys watch proudly as the last ones go
through.
The temple doors close.

ANGLE ON DREW
Who is crushed. His chance is gone.
                    ASHEMA (CONT'D)

           I'm sorry, Drew. It was a good effort.
Drew is sitting there, trying to understand what is happening when
the door to the temple opens again. The Drill Sergeant appears in the
doorway and impatiently motions for Drew to come in.
The crowd has stopped and is watching the drama unfold.
Drew gets up warily, expecting some trick.
The Drill Sergeant motions again, wanting Drew to hurry up.
Drew looks at Ashema and her Bau Bau and smiles. He picks up his
backpack and starts towards the temple, limping from sitting for so
long.
The crowd goes crazy, clapping and yelling.
Drew runs into the temple. The door closes behind him.

INT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ SAME DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF INTERIOR OF TEMPLE.

The line of disciples has stopped, waiting for Drew. Drew, back pack
in hand, takes his place at the end of the line.

They parade past a line of monks assembled in the courtyard inside
the temple.

As they walk by, some of the monks look nonplused, while a few are
put out by the fact that Drew is among them.

Several of the disciples turn around to look at Drew, and a couple
are openly hostile to him.

They file up to a raised platform, on which stand 20 monks, each
holding a scroll in their hands, one monk for every new disciple.

A gong sounds, and the questions begin.

ANGLE ON FIRST DISCIPLE
Who is asked...

                    MONK
           Do you accept the authority of the Shaolin patriarchs?
                    DISCIPLE 1

           Yes, without pause.
ANGLE ON DREW
                    MONK
           Do you renounce the earthly world?
                    DREW

           Sure do, master. You bet.

The monk pauses, for that is not the ritual answer to the question.
The Drill Sergeant comes up to him and whispers in his ear, and the
monk then continues.
                     MONK
           Will you abide by the rules of the temple, even if it
           means death?
                     DREW
           I do.
The Drill Sergeant comes up behind Drew and WHACKS him in the side
with his elbow.
                     DRILL SERGEANT
                   (whispering)

           Answer "Yes, without pause."

                     DREW

                   (rubbing his side)

           Yes, without pause.

ANGLE ON ANOTHER DISCIPLE

                     MONK

           Who is the patriarch of the Shaolin Temple?

                     DISCIPLE 2

           Bodhidharma.

ANGLE ON DREW

                     MONK

           Do you accept the shr fu at the Shaolin Temple as your
           spiritual leaders?
                     DREW
           Yes, without pause.
The Drill Sergeant nods his head.
                     MONK

           Will a fighting monk ever use his skills for personal
           gain?

Drew pauses, looking at the Drill Sergeant. The D.S. nods, urging him
on.
                     DREW
           Yes, without pause.

The D.S. puts his hands over his eyes.
                      DREW (CONT'D)
           I mean, no, of course not.
Then, another gong sounds, and the quizzing is concluded.
A figure moves down a corridor in beautiful robes. Everyone bows
down, their eyes on the floor, to the figure, who is moving towards
the raised platform in the center.
Drew, also bowed down, sneaks a peak at the figure.
It is San De!
San De catches his eye and smiles slightly. He winks at Drew, then
clears his throat.
Everyone stands up again.

                      SAN DE

           Do these disciples accept the authority of the Shaolin
           Temple?

                      DRILL SERGEANT

           Yes, without pause, Master San De.

ANGLE ON DREW

Who now knows that the monk he called a "Janitor" is the headmaster!

                      DREW

                 (under his breath)

           I'll be damned!

The DISCIPLE next to him, GAO, pokes him sharply in the ribs.

                      GAO
           Shut up!

                      DREW
                 (holding his side)
           Oh, unbelievable, in the same place...

                      SAN DE
           Are they ready to begin their training?
                      DRILL SERGEANT
           They are.
                      SAN DE

           Then, let us welcome them into our ranks!

Gongs go off, firecrackers are set off, and a special flag is raised
on the flag pole. A roar comes from the crowd outside.
ANGLE ON THE DISCIPLES
All of whom are happy. All, that is, except for Gao, who is staring
at Drew.
Drew, notices the stare.
                    DREW
           You got a problem, man?
                    GAO
           You, American...
ANGLE ON SAN DE

When the noise subsides.

                    SAN DE

           Your training begins tomorrow. For now, your shr fu will
           introduce you to our temple. Welcome to Shaolin.

San De walks away, and the disciples are split into several
"platoons". Drew is matched up with the Drill Sergeant, and Gao is
also in his group.

                    DREW

           Great, just great.

They are motioned to follow Gao out of the courtyard and into the
temple proper.

INT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ SAME DAY

Drew walks behind the other disciples, who are lining up to get their
robes. As he takes his place in line, a monk comes up to take Drew's
backpack. Drew resists, and a tug of war ensues.

                    DREW
           What are you doing, man?
                    MONK

           You must surrender this.
                    DREW
           No way, man! Get your own...

The Drill Sergeant sees the scuffle and walks over.
                    D.S.
           It is unseemly to argue like this. Take the backpack into
           the sleeping quarters.

                 (to Drew)
           Do not cling to material things ­ it is not good for your
           soul.
He walks away, and Drew reluctantly gives up his backpack.
Drew lines back up, and is about to get his robes, when Gao slides
over and takes them from him. Drew immediately shoves him and tries
to grab the robes back. Gao smiles and moves away, holding the robes
up and away from Drew.
Drew is pissed and ready to go after Gao. Before he can, however, LI,
another disciple, grabs another set of robes from the table and gives
it to Drew, pulling him away from the confrontation.
                    DREW (CONT'D)
           What's with that guy?

                    LI

           Watch out for Gao. He's trouble.

                    DREW

           Really? I hadn't noticed... Why'd they let him in,
           anyway?

                    LI

           Who knows? Maybe for the challenge?

                    DREW

           No, that was me...

They both smile and walk off.

about the haircut.

           Mr. James designs my hair, master. I don't think...
                    D.S.

           This will symbolize your final break from the outside

The D.S. shakes his head, and Drew sits down, unhappy.
The barber starts on Drew's head, big clumps of hair falling down to
the floor.

           What outside world? I don't want to be seen by anybody...
He rubs his hand over his head, and then sees the others.
Li is smiling.

INT. DORM ­ NIGHT

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THEIR SLEEPING QUARTERS, AS THE MONKS FILE IN,
LED BY THE D.S.

A number of cots are lined up side by side. The D.S. has assigned a
bed to each monk. Drew finds his bed, which is right next to Gao's.

                    GAO

           I want another bed.

                    D.S.

           Why?

                    GAO (CONT'D)

           I won't sleep next to the American.
                    D.S.
           We are no longer Chinese or Americans, Han or Mongol. We
           are Shaolin. Everyone is a monk.
                    GAO (CONT'D)

           Well, this monk smells!
Drew unconsciously smells himself. He shakes his head.
Li goes up to the D.S. and points to the bed he was assigned.
                    LI
           I will switch with Disciple Gao.

D.S. nods, and then starts for the door.
                      D.S.
           Go to sleep. No talking! We have an early day of training
           tomorrow.
Gao collects his stuff and starts off to the new bed, hitting Drew
with his shoulder. Drew trips him as he walks away, all done very
secretively since the D.S. is watching.
                      DREW
           Jerk!
Li comes over to the new bed, and in silence they get climb into
their respective beds. D.S. switches off the lights, then leaves, and
Drew stares up at the ceiling.
                      DREW (CONT'D)

ANGLE ON DREW, SLEEPING
All is quiet.

Suddenly, a huge stick ENTERS FRAME, and it pauses for a moment above
Drew, before THUMPING down on top of him.
Drew cries out when he is hit, and jumps out of bed, looking all
around him. No one is there. A few of the disciples are moving around
because he yelled, but there is nothing else there.
Drew, belatedly, gets into a fighting stance, but no other attack is
coming.

Drew yelps and jumps, looking    around for the attacker.

No one is there, and his underwear is now all wet.

He takes the bowl away.

           Wooden Man, I think.

                    WU

           No, it'll be basics, first day. Horse stance, kicks and
           punches...

When they are all dressed, they run out of the room.

EXT. TRAINING AREA ­ SAME DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF ALL THE DISCIPLES LINED UP, READY FOR THE
TRAINING.

In the b.g. are the fighting monks, going through their routines.

ANGLE ON FIGHTING MONKS

As they go through forms or free sparring. There are SHOTS of monks
throwing stars, working with weapons, etc. It is all very exciting.

ANGLE ON DREW

Who is more excited than all the others.

ANGLE ON THE D.S.
As he walks to the front of the group. In his hand he is carrying a
shovel.
D.S. Bodhidharma, the patriarch of the Shaolin Temple taught us that
to train the mind, we first have to train the body.
ANGLE ON WU, WHO SHIELDS HIS MOUTH AND WHISPERS
                    WU
           Basics, I told you.
ANGLE ON D.S.

Who motions to one of the monks behind him, who has a wheelbarrow
filled with shovels.

                    D.S.
           Each one of you take a shovel.
                    DREW
           We're using the shovels as weapons?
                    D.S.
                 (smiling)
           Weapons...
                 (beat)
           ... in the war on infection.
D.S. motions with his hand, and in the distance is the latrine
building.

                    D.S. (CONT'D)

           You will be digging today, digging our new latrines.

                    DREW

           Latrines? Why?

                    D.S.

           A Shaolin fighting monk-in training does not ask
           questions. He just obeys.

The D.S. leads the way to the latrine building, and the disciples
follow, each of them carrying a shovel. Drew is trudging along, not
believing what they are doing.

                    DREW (CONT'D)

           I came halfway around the world to dig latrines? I could
           have just joined the army...

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:
LATRINE WORK AREA ­ MONTAGE
MONTAGE SEQUENCE OF WORK DETAIL.

ANGLE ON DREW AND THE OTHER DISCIPLES
Digging with their shovels. Their training clothes are already
sweated through and dirty. Their shirts are off, and their arm
muscles are bulging and shining in the hot sunshine.
ANGLE ON DREW
As he lifts up two heavy buckets of dirt on a pole, then places the
pole on his shoulders, the muscles in his arms, shoulders and back
straining. He walks off to the side of the area to dump it.
As he dumps the dirt, a pole appears and CRACKS across his back. He
drops the buckets and falls to the ground. He gets up as quickly as

he can, but there is no one to be seen.
ANGLE ON DREW AND DISCIPLES
As they are working hard on the latrines. Drew is teaching them an
American song as they work.
                    DREW (CONT'D)
           "Ain't no cure for the Shaolin Temple Blues... "
                    OR
           "Working on a Chain Gang"
                    OR (CONT'D)
           "I fought the law and the law won"
                    OR (CONT'D)

           "16 tons"

The monks are singing along with him. All except for Gao.

ANGLE ON DREW AND DISCIPLES AS THEY EAT THEIR LUNCH

It is again very meager: a bowl of rice, a bowl of soup and a piece
of scrawny meat. Drew looks at it for a moment. The

D.S. is standing over his shoulder.

                    D.S.

           Any problems?

Drew shakes his head and starts to eat, quickly.

ANGLE ON DREW

As he loads up a two baskets of dirt onto his pole. He gets it up
onto his shoulders, in pain, and starts to walk. Immediately, the
D.S. is there in front of him.

He examines the baskets. They are not full.
He moves quickly and dumps both baskets of dirt.

                    DREW
                 (shocked)
           What'd you do that for?
                    D.S.
           Do a job well or don't do it.

ANGLE ON GAO AND THE DISCIPLES
As they are in line for water. They each drink a large glass full,
then move back to their work area. Drew is the last in line. When
Drew gets to the front, the D.S. smiles and shakes his head.

                       D.S.
           Sorry, all gone. Get some more.
Drew stares at all the water spilled onto the ground, then looks up
at the D.S., then forces a smile. He takes the proferred buckets of
water (made of wood, with pointed bottoms and large handles). The
D.S. indicates that they are to be held straight out to the sides, to
work on the shoulder muscles. Drew turns and walks away, muttering to
himself.
                       DREW (CONT'D)
           I'm gonna get you, man. Oh, yeah...
Gao is laughing as he watches Drew go.
EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ SAME DAY
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW FILLING THE BUCKETS IN THE STREAM.

Once they are filled, he starts back for the temple. His shoulders
are straining from the weight of the buckets.

He goes over the path to the temple, having to negotiate logs over
chasms, etc. After various trials and tribulations, Drew arrives at
the temple, his arms incredibly tired. The D.S. is there waiting for
him.

Drew, determined not to show any weakness, raises the buckets a
little bit higher. He comes to the D.S., proud and defiant. The D.S.
motions for him to put the buckets down.

Without thinking, Drew, puts the buckets down, and they both fall
over, spilling their contents onto the ground. Drew tries to stop
them, but he's too late. The water has all spilled out onto the
ground.

                       DREW

           Don't tell me, I know. Get more water...

INT. DORM ROOM ­ NIGHT

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DISCIPLES ALL IN BED.
They are exhausted from their work. Drew is lying in bed, his eyes
wide open, ready to get attacked.
ANGLE ON DREW

As his eyes go closed, finally.
EXT. WORK AREA ­ DAY
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW WALKING ON A RIDGE BETWEEN TWO LARGE HOLES,
CARRYING HUGE BASKETS OF DIRT ON HIS POLE.
He is balancing as he walks.
ANGLE ON GAO
Who is working at the other end. He starts across the same ridge.

They come to the middle: a stand off.
                       GAO
           Back up and let me pass.
                       DREW
           No chance, Gao. You back up.
Gao smiles and shakes   his head. Gao starts forward, and WHACKS Drew
in the leg with a leg   sweep. Drew tries to keep his balance, and
fights a valient, but   losing battle. He falls over the side, the dirt
in his buckets flying   everywhere. Gao wipes his hands off and
continues walking.
CLOSEUP ON DREW'S BLOODY HAND
A huge splinter sticking out of it. He is in real pain. The D.S.
walks over and looks at the splinter, and in one move pulls it out.

                       D.S.

                 (heartlessly)

           Shaolin monks feel no pain. Rub some dirt on it and you
           will be fine.

He walks away.

ANGLE ON DREW AND THE DISCIPLES

On a work break. They are watching the monks training in the
distance. It is all the more desirable because it is unattainable.

In the distance, a monk can be seen walking between two other monks.
They are leading him out.

The monk continues walking until he walks right in front of the
disciples. His face and body are covered with bruises and welts. The
two other monks don't say a word, their faces grim.

Li turns to the D.S.
                       LI

           What happened?
                       D.S.
           He failed to pass through the wooden man chamber. He must
           leave the temple.
The D.S. walks off.
                       LI (CONT'D)
           The "Wooden Man Chamber"! The ultimate test of a Shaolin
           monk...
                       WU

           Did you see his face?

                       SHU
           Poor guy.
                       GAO
           He just wasn't good enough. I wouldn't be surprised if
           half of us go out the same way.
The D.S. appears and motions for them to work.
INT. MEDITATION HALL ­ DAY
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DISCIPLES, DREW IN THE MIDDLE, SITTING IN ROWS
IN THE INCENSE-FILLED MEDITATION CHAMBER.
The monk in charge of the chamber is talking to them.
                       MEDITATION MONK

           Breath in through your nose, out through your mouth.
           Imagine yourself sitting on the bank of a river watching
           your thoughts flow by. Clear your mind... Think of
           nothing.

Drew sits, trying to think of nothing. He is not succeeding.

INT. DINING AREA ­ NIGHT

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW WASHING DISHES, ALONE IN THE KITCHEN AREA.

He bends over to get a dish, when a pole comes and SMACKS him on the
rear end. He turns immediately in one direction, but gets hit again
from the OTHER direction.

Drew is furious, and he can't even see the attacker.

                       DREW

           Come out, goddamn it! Show yourself!

No answer, as we HOLD on Drew looking around.

EXT. WORK AREA ­ DAY
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DARK BROWN LIQUID BEING POURED INTO A LARGE PIT.
Drew is walking with Li, having just dumped their buckets into a
large hole.

                       DREW
           So what is this 'night soil' stuff anyway?
                       LI

           Human waste.
                       DREW
           Oh, man! You guys actually use this as fertilizer? That's
           disgusting!

They turn to go back, and there is Gao, balancing a huge basket of
night soil over his head, peasant-style. He is on the same ridge that
they are going to walk on.
                       DREW (CONT'D)
           Hi, Gao. How you doing?
                       GAO
                 (a little worried)
           Let me pass.
He reaches down and plucks a stick out of the earth at his feet, and
then closes on Gao a little bit.
                       DREW (CONT'D)
           There's something on the bottom of your basket.

Drew pokes at the basket for a moment, right over Gao's head. Then,
he JAMS the stick in, and holds it there.

                       DREW (CONT'D)

           Oops! I think I found the problem.

                 (beat)

           A hole.

Drew pulls the stick out and watches as the night soil cascades down
onto Gao's head. They back away as Gao goes running towards the pit
where the night soil is deposited.

                       DREW (CONT'D)

                 (to Li)

           Well, somebody sure smells!

EXT. WORK AREA ­ DAY

THE DISCIPLES ARE WORKING EXTREMELY HARD.
As they work, a group of fighting monks walk by after a workout. Drew
stops working and watches them pass.
                       DREW
           This is ridiculous.

Suddenly, a bamboo pole CRACKS Drew on the shoulder. He turns around,
ready for a fight, only to see the D.S. standing there, the pole
raised for another strike.

                       D.S.
           Back to work.
Drew is about to say something, but doesn't. He returns to work.

DORM AREA ­ NIGHT
ANGLE ON DREW MASSAGING HIS MUSCLES
He is sitting with Li and a couple of the other disciples, Wu, Shu
and Low.
                    DREW (CONT'D)
           I've got an idea on how to get even with our beloved
           Drill Sergeant...
They all huddle a little closer.
EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ DAY
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF D.S. AS HE WALKS ALONG THE PATH.
In the b.g. can be seen Drew, Li, Wu and a couple other of the
disciples. They are waiting for something.

The D.S. hits the trip wire and suddenly two bamboo poles HURTLE
towards him, ready to slam him in the shoulders.

With one beautiful move, the D.S. breaks both poles, shattering when
they hit his arms.

The D.S. hardly breaks stride and continues walking. He looks back
once, and sees the outline of the group of disciples.

ANGLE ON DREW AND THE GUYS


Who are up and running as soon as they are spotted. They run by Gao,
who was watching from another area.

EXT. D.S. QUARTERS ­ SAME DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF GAO WAITING OUTSIDE D.S. ROOM.

He looks around, knocks, and then goes in.

EXT. COURTYARD ­ SAME DAY
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF ENTIRE CLASS GATHERED TOGETHER.
The D.S. walks into the front of the courtyard and addresses the
group.
Gao is standing off to the side, a smug smile on his face.
                    D.S.
           You are all responsible for anything that happens within
           your group. What happened yesterday falls on everyone's
           shoulders. So, all of you will do double work...
ANGLE ON GAO
The smug smile gone now.
INT. MEDITATION ROOM ­ DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF GROUP OF DISCIPLES SEATED ON ROUND PILLOWS
PRACTISING ZAZEN, SITTING MEDITATION.
Drew is in the center of the room, and the sound of light snoring is
heard.
ANGLE ON DREW
It is him, he is asleep!
Suddenly, a bamboo shinai is SLAMMED across Drew's back, waking him
up.
                       MEDITATION MONK
           Bodhidharma meditated for 9 years without sleeping. Think
           you can manage 9 minutes?
EXT. WORK AREA ­ DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THE ENTIRE GROUP LABORING IN THE FIELDS.

They are all singing "Chain Gang".

TIGHT ON SEVERAL OF THE DISCIPLES

They are good workers, and they don't mind the hard work nor the hot
weather quite so much.

ANGLE ON DREW

Working hard.

INT. DORM AREA ­ NIGHT

ANGLE ON DREW

Who is holding court.

                       DREW

           We came here to train, not to be slaves! We're free
           men...

                       MU
           But we swore to obey them...
                       DREW

           An uninformed choice is no choice at all!
                       MU
           Huh?

                       DREW
           We have to stand up for our rights! If they don't even
           know we're dissatisfied, things will never change.
                       GAO

           They haven't changed for centuries, why should we listen
           to you?
                    DREW
           Are we men or mice? Sheep or the shepherd?
                    WU
           I'm with you!
The others are with him too, except for Gao. They are ready to
explode, and Drew has the match.
                    DREW
           I'm for going to the Headmaster right now!
They are all ready. They head for the door, but Gao doesn't move.
Drew stops at the door and turns to Gao.

                    DREW (CONT'D)

           You're either with us, Gao, or you're against us.

No answer from Gao. They exit the room.

INT. HALLWAY ­ SAME NIGHT

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW AND THE BOYS RUSHING DOWN THE CORRIDOR,
HEADING FOR SAN DE'S QUARTERS.

ANGLE ON D.S.

Heading for the same place but from a different direction.

INT. SHAOLIN HALLWAY ­ SAME NIGHT

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF GROUP ASSEMBLED OUTSIDE SAN DE'S CHAMBERS.

Drew goes to knock on the door, when it opens and San De is standing
there. The D.S. has just arrived. He looks at San De for
instructions, but San De indicates that he will deal with them.

                    DREW
           Master San De!
                    SAN DE

           Who else?
                    DREW
           We have something to say...

                    SAN DE
           This is an interesting coincidence, as I was just on my
           way to your sleeping quarters to talk with you all.
                    DREW

           I request permission to go first.
                    SAN DE
           I think I'd better...
                    DREW
           No, really, I want to...
San De holds up his hand. He is the final authority.
                    SAN DE
           Here at the temple,    we use a period of intense physical
           labor to test your    patience, and to teach you humility
           and self-reliance.    As you continue training, you will be
           given chores every    day ­ remember the first time you saw
           me I was sweeping?    Physical labor keeps us humble.

ANGLE ON THE DISCIPLES

Who tonight have been anything but humble.

                    SAN DE (CONT'D)

           You've all performed    admirably, and have learned an
           important lesson ­ to    obey your shr fu without question.
           Because of this, I've    decided to begin your martial
           training sooner than    what is prescribed. Tomorrow
           morning.

The disciples can hardly believe their luck.

                    SAN DE (CONT'D)

           And, what did you have to say to me?

ANGLE ON DREW

Who is sputtering now.

                    DREW

           I... I mean we, just wanted to... thank you for the
           opportunity to be part of the illustrious history of the
           Shaolin Temple.

                 (beat)
           Yeah, that's it. Right, guys?
They all say "Thank you" as one, and then bow to the headmaster with
their hands clasped in front of them. They turn away and head down
the hallway.
ANGLE ON THE DISCIPLES

As they increase their pace, almost running through the halls with
their excitement.

INT. DORM AREA ­ SAME NIGHT

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DOOR TO THE SLEEPING QUARTERS.
Suddenly, it BURSTS open and in come the disciples, led by Drew. They
fan out into the room, Drew in the center.
                    DREW
           Gentlemen, this calls for a party!
He runs to his backpack and pulls out a boom box with speakers, and
puts on some good old American Rock 'N' Roll.
Everyone, but Gao, is moving in time with the music. Drew is the most
accomplished dancer, but the others are pretty bad.
The entire effect of the bald-headed monks rocking out is very comic.
Drew starts showing Li and Wu a couple of dance routines (old stuff ­
the swim, the twist, etc.). Everyone is having a great time.

ANGLE ON GAO

Glowering, as he moves toward the boom box.

He reaches for the "Stop" button.

Drew blocks the arm, and a pushing and shoving match starts.

                    GAO

           You're trying to get us all kicked out!

                    DREW

           I'm just trying to have a party. Chill out!

They push and shove into the middle of the room, a couple of kicks
and punches thrown, then they face off, ready to duke it out.

The party is raging, while Gao and Drew are the only ones static, set
to do battle.

Just then, the door starts to open. Everyone freezes and looks toward
the door, including Gao. Drew, meanwhile, has the presence of mind to
jump onto the boom box, shutting it off and hiding it with his body.
ANGLE ON DOOR
As the D.S. opens it and sticks his head in.
He surveys the room, seeing the tableau of frozen monks, with Drew
lying on his bed.
ANGLE ON DREW
Who waves to the D.S.

ANGLE ON THE D.S.
Who knows that something is going on.
                    D.S.

           Go to sleep. Lights out.
He hits the lights and then closes the door. In the semi-darkness the
room relaxes in a collective sigh. Drew stands up and packs up the
stereo.
Gao walks over past Drew.
                    GAO
           It's not over, American.
INT. MAIN CHAMBER ­ MORNING
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF CHAMBER FULL OF FIGHTING MONKS, ALL GOING
THROUGH THE SAME SET OF MOVEMENTS.
Kick. Punch.
Kick. Punch.

INTERCUT of feet striking the stone floor, depressions in the floor
testifying to the centuries of training this chamber has seen.

Through the door come the D.S., Drew and the others. They line up
along one wall, watching the fighting monks go through their form.

It is beautiful: powerful, graceful and intimidating.

Their form done, they file out of the chamber, leaving the D.S. with
his group, along with one fighting monk. The D.S. motions for them to
line up as the monks had.

                    D.S.

           You will train 6 days a week, from 5 am to 9 p.m.,
           alternating with work and meditation. Sunday afternoon is
           free time.

D.S. lets that sink in, then motions for the monk to take over.

                    MONK
           In order to keep our bodies strong, Bodhidharma gave us a
           series of exercises and breathing techniques. Because the
           times demanded action, we developed Shaolin style wu shu
           from these exercises.
He goes through a couple of martial movements.
                    MONK (CONT'D)

           The spirit of Bodhidharma remains. Training is like
           meditation. Be aware of everything, but aware of nothing
           in particular. Think not thinking.
                    DREW
           What do you mean, 'Think not thinking'?
                    MONK

            Non thinking.
ANGLE ON DREW
Confused.
ANGLE ON MONK
Who doesn't explain any further.
                    MONK (CONT'D)
            Your training begins today, in this most sacred of
            training halls. The floor bears witness to the efforts of
            fighting monks from centuries past.
ANGLE ON FLOOR
Where there are depressions and worn spots, the result of thousands
of hours of training.

                    MONK (CONT'D)

            At the Shaolin temple, we forge our bodies in the fire of
            our wills. We adhere to a vow of non-violence, unless
            someone else is in danger... Follow my movements...

He starts moving through a series of techniques, and the rest of the
disciples try to mimic his actions. He is moving around the room, and
they are trying to do what he is doing.

Some are getting it, some aren't.

Drew, used to a more individualized type of training, isn't getting
it.

EXT. TRAINING AREA ­ DAY

ESTABLISHING TIGHT SHOT OF WEDGE THWOCKING INTO THE GROUND.

A hand COMES INTO FRAME, grabs the wedge and pulls it back out of the
ground.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL Drew, along with the other disciples, lined up
and throwing these sharp wedges into the ground and pulling it back
out. Their muscles are bulging with the effort.
ANGLE ON HUGE SMOKING BRASS URNS
Filled to the brim with small stones. Drew is forcing his arms into
the urn in "Iron Palm" training.

ANGLE ON MONK ON A SET OF POLES
He is going through a complex form, kicking and punching, never
missing or faltering a step. Some of the poles are as high as 6 feet
off the ground.
ANGLE ON GAO ON THE POLES
He is less sure, but at least he doesn't fall.

ANGLE ON DREW
Trying the poles. He starts out well, but he soon misses and falls,
almost impaling himself on a pole.
                      DREW
           I can't do this!
                      D.S.
           Here at Shaolin, can't doesn't exist. Only won't.
EXT. TRAINING AREA ­ DAY
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DISCIPLES PAIRED OFF.
Drew is working with his friend Li. They are moving through a series
of techniques, ending with a flashy kicking technique which is to
blocked by a special Shaolin technique.

Each time Li throws the final kick, Drew gets hit, HARD.

His block isn't working. A monk comes up to him.

                      MONK

           Block the way I showed you.

                      DREW

                 (showing him a block)

           This is the way I was taught.

                      MONK (CONT'D)

           Do it this way. You won't get hit.

Drew bows and turns to continue working with Li. By this time,
however, the ranks have shifted, and Gao is opposite Drew.

Drew attacks first in the series, and Gao uses the block to easily
deflect Drew's kick.
                      GAO
                 (menacingly)
           My turn.
He attacks, and Drew gets to the final technique. He blocks the way
he did before, and he gets slammed brutally by Gao.
Gao stands over him, smiling.

EXT. TRAINING AREA ­ DAY
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF MONKS FLIPPING THROUGH THE AIR, DOING FLYING
KICKS, AERIALS, ETC.
A monk is alternately falling down and kipping up, falling down and

kipping up.
Drew's group is working on several very athletic maneuvers, none of
which Drew is especially good at. Gao, of course, is having no
trouble.
Drew tries a flying move and falls into a heap on the ground. He is
very angry, and he hits the ground with his fist.
                      MONK
              Emotions cloud the spirit ­ eliminate them.
                      DREW
              This isn't martial arts ­ it's gymnastics!
                      MONK
              This is Shaolin Wu Shu. Continue.

Drew sits in the dirt, watching everyone around him sail through the
air and flip over the ground. He is not a happy camper.

EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TRAINING AREA.

The entire group is gathered in a sort of pit, on a hard concrete
floor. D.S. stands in the middle.

                      D.S.

              I want to go over some takedowns before we end for the
              day. I'll need a partner...

He scans the group, and then points to Drew. Drew smiles ruefully,
walks to the front and bows to D.S.

                      D.S.

              Watch carefully as I take him down, using techniques from
              shwai jyau, Chinese wrestling.

                      DREW
                   (looking at ground)
              Excuse me, Master, but there aren't any mats here.
                      D.S.
              Do they always use mats in America?

The group laughs a little at that, and Drew's manhood is now
challenged.

                      D.S. (CONT'D)
              If you are scared, I'll get someone else. Perhaps Gao
              would assist me...
ANGLE ON GAO

Who is already getting up, ready and willing.
This changes Drew's mind right away.
ANGLE ON DREW AND D.S.
                     DREW
           Let's do it.
                     D.S.
           Attack me straight on...
Drew attacks, and is taken down brutally, smashed into the hard
concrete floor. No attempt is made to cushion or soften the blow.
Drew gets up right away, and attacks again. Again he is driven to the
ground. This continues from all angles and all methods of attack.

ANGLE ON THE GROUP

Who can barely watch the destruction.

ANGLE ON THE FIGHT

The D.S. does not let up at all, taking

Drew down hard each time. Every time, regardless of the impact, Drew
gets right back up. His eyes are dazed, there is a little blood
coming out of his nose, but he keeps coming back for more.

Finally, after a high arcing back throw, a real thumper, the worst of
all of them, the D.S. calls it a day.

                     D.S.

           Any questions? Good, that's all for today.

Before anyone can move, however, Drew raises his hand as high as he
can, obviously in pain.

                     DREW (CONT'D)
           I'm not sure I got that last throw clear in my mind.

The group gasps, knowing how much Drew must be hurting, admiring him
for his guts. Even Gao is impressed.

                     D.S.
           I said that's enough.
                     DREW (CONT'D)
           If you're getting too old for this kind of training, I
           understand.
                     D.S.
           Attack!

Drew attacks, and the D.S. executes the manuever perfectly, crashing

Drew down almost on his head. Luckily, Drew is able to twist at the
last moment and take the impact on his already bruised shoulder. He
moans and groans and lies there.
                       DREW (CONT'D)
           I think I've got it now. Xie Xie!
The group disburses, shaking their heads in wonder. Li comes up to
Drew, who is still lying on the ground.
                       LI
           Are you trying to kill yourself?
                       DREW
           He hurts more than me, he's just not bleeding, that's
           all.

He tries to get up, but moans in pain and falls back down.

Li helps him up and takes him to the showers.

ANGLE ON D.S.

Watching them go. There is a slight smile on his face.

EXT. DORMITORY ­ SAME DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF LI RUBBING THE BRUISE ON DREW'S SHOULDER WITH
TIGER BALM.

It is huge, and looks really painful.

                       LI

           If you go to San De, he can send you to a doctor...

Drew pulls away and stands up. He backs up to the wall of the
dormitory, right underneath a window.

                       DREW

           I appreciate your concern, Li, but it's not that serious.
           I'm all right.

Just as he is talking, Gao comes to the window with a pan of dirty
water (from washing the floor of the dorm).

GAO LOOKS DOWN (GAO POV) AND SEES DREW
Hhe smiles, then pours the huge bucket over the edge, dousing Drew.
ANGLE ON DREW
As the dirty water hits him, drenching him.
EXT. WATERFALL ­ DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF WATERFALL.
It is huge, and the water is crashing down from high above.

ANGLE ON A MONK, INSIDE THE WATERFALL
He is going through martial arts techniques as the water thunders
onto him.
ANGLE ON D.S. AND GROUP
As they stand on the bank.
                        D.S.
              Concentrate on your stance. All I want you to do is try
              to hold your stance. Li, you're first.
Li smiles and walks into the waterfall, using a walkway that goes
behind the thundering water.
He moves into the water a little, and gets into a deep horse stance.
He stand there, immovable. After a moment, he turns to look at D.S.

ANGLE ON D.S.

Who motions him farther into the water.

ANGLE ON LI

Who nods his head and walks into the thundering water. As soon as he
gets into the main stream of water, he is forced off the ledge and he
falls about 20 feet into the pool below.

                        D.S.

              Next...

Each of them try it in turn. Everyone fails.

Gao goes in, and he manages to stand under the impact of the water
for a moment, before he too succumbs and goes down into the pool.

ANGLE ON DREW

It's his turn. He walks to the waterfall and goes in. He picks up an
umbrella he stashed behind the waterfall (imprinted with a "NEW YORK
GIANTS NFL" logo on it ­ unmistakably American).

He walks into the waterfall, and the umbrella works for a moment.
Drew is holding it with both hands, and he gets into a deep horse
stance.
He turns to smile at the D.S., and then waves at the others. As soon
as he takes a hand off the handle of the umbrella, the water slams
him and off he goes into the pool.
He lands with a huge splash, doing a painful bellow flop. Drew comes
to the surface, still clutching the now- destroyed umbrella. He
smiles at the other disciples, who are still swimming, sheepishly.
                        DREW

              Thought I'd join you guys.
INT. TEMPLE TRAINING HALL ­ DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF GROUPS WORKING OUT.
Drew is in with the group. Gao and Drew are chosen to do a training
exercise together.
                     D.S.
           In this exercise, you try to touch your partner's chest
           lightly, and your partner tries to block.
The group gets started doing the drill, and Gao is almost caving
Drew's chest in with his blows. He is so close to Drew that Drew
doesn't have a chance to block it. On the last strike, Drew falls
back to the ground.
The D.S. is there immediately.
                     D.S.
           Something wrong?

Drew shakes his head and gets back up.

                     D.S.

           Switch!

Now it's Drew's turn to strike, and he tries to hit Gao with the same
amount of force as he did, but Gao avoids his attack, throwing him
off balance. He throws another punch out, and Gao grabs it and pulls.

Drew falls to the floor again. A monk who was watching walks over.

                     MONK

           The goal of this drill is not to hurt your partner. Just
           try to tap his chest.

                     DREW

           I know, but...

                     MONK
           Then do it that way...
The Monk walks away, shaking his head.

EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ EVENING
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TEMPLE COURTYARD, EMPTY EXCEPT FOR DREW AND LI
PLAYING CATCH WITH A FRISBEE.
Drew is flipping it in a bunch of different ways, and Li is enjoying
watching him.
To the side of the courtyard are two brooms leaning against the wall.

                     DREW
           This sure beats sweeping...

ANGLE ON FRISBEE
Floating past temple statues and ancient Chinese decorations, barely
missing them.
Drew makes an acrobatic catch and then flicks it back to Li, harder
than he should have. It heads for an ancient statue and smacks it
dead center, right in the face.
The statue starts to tip!
Drew and Li rush for the statue and catch it, just before it tips
over and smashes on the ground.
They look at each other, thanking their lucky stars the statue didn't
fall. They start to throw the frisbee again, when Drew spots the D.S.
coming towards them.
Drew stashes the frisbee in his shirt and grabs the brooms.

He tosses one to Li and they just begin sweeping again when the D.S.
rounds the corner.

The D.S. knows something is going on, but they look so innocent.

                       D.S.

           Sweep the main chamber, Drew.

                       DREW (CONT'D)

           Yes, master.

He bows and smiles goodbye to Li. He walks into the main training
chamber.

INT. CHAMBER ­ SAME EVENING

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW WALKING INTO THE CHAMBER.

This is the chamber where they had their first workout, and Drew just
stands there for a moment, soaking up the tradition of it.

He walks to an area of the chamber under the famous painting and
stands staring at it.

QUICK CUTS to different ANGLES of the painting.
ANGLE ON DREW
Who begins to sweep.

His broom is going over the depressions where the monks train, and
soon he loses his desire to sweep. He takes the broom in his hand as
a weapon and starts to spin it, going through a martial arts form,
his feet moving naturally into the depressions in the floor.
He finishes with a flourish, having moved into a shadowy area in a
corner, and then bows to an imaginary crowd, using the broom as a
microphone.
                       DREW

                    (imitating an announcer)
              Presenting, the greatest fighter in the history of the
              Shaolin temple... Drew Carson!
Drew holds his broom over his head, nodding his head to the imaginary
crowd.
                          DREW
              The crowd is going wild.
Just then, out of the shadows comes an attacking staff, SLAMMING into
Drew's unprotected stomach!
Drew, ready to double over in pain, hears the staff hit the frisbee,
and stands up straight, adjusting the frisbee that saved his stomach.
Before he can react, the staff SMACKS him in the back of the head and
sends him pitching to the floor.

ANGLE ON DREW

As he lands face down in the pile of dust and dirt he already swept
up.

EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ EVENING

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TEMPLE COURTYARD, THE SUN SETTING IN THE
DISTANCE.

Drew is standing in front of a painting-statue of Bodhidharma, one in
which he is made to look extremely fierce.

San De walks up behind Drew and stands there for a moment.

                          SAN DE

              He was an amazing monk...

                          DREW

              Yeah, what's up with him?
                          SAN DE
              Come with me...

San De walks away, and Drew follows him.
INT. SAN DE'S CHAMBERS ­ SAME NIGHT
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF SAN DE BREWING TEA.
The room is filled with paintings and scrolls. A Golden Sash hangs in
a place of honor.
San De    puts the tea    leaves into the pot, then soaks them with boiling
water.    He pours the    water out, then repeats the process several
times.    His movements    are all very precise and careful ­ it almost
looks    like a martial    art kata.

                    SAN DE
           Legend states that Bodhidharma gave us tea. Once, while
           meditating, Bodhidharma fell asleep, a natural reaction
           we all have to fight against.
San De looks pointedly at Drew, who doesn't meet his eyes.
                 SAN DE (CONT'D)
           When he awoke, he was so enraged at his eyelids for
           betraying him, he tore them off and threw them to the
           ground.
                 (beat)
           From those eyelids grew the first tea bush. You see, even
           the leaves look like eyelids.
San De shows Drew a tea leaf.

                    DREW

           Impossible.

                    SAN DE

           Nothing is impossible if your spirit is pure, and your
           will is strong.

The tea is ready, and San De begins to pour for Drew.

                    SAN DE (CONT'D)

           I understand you've been questioning some of the
           teachings of the temple...

                    DREW

           It's just not the way I was taught...

San De keeps pouring into Drew's cup. It is getting to the rim. San
De is not stopping.
                    DREW (CONT'D)
           Master! Stop! No more will go in!

San De continues pouring until the tea runs all over the table.
                    SAN DE
           Exactly! You are like this cup, full of what you have
           learned. How can we show you Shaolin unless you first
           empty your cup?
He picks up the cup and tosses the tea through an open window. He now
pours into the empty cup.
                    SAN DE (CONT'D)
           The rules and disciplines of the temple exist to free
           you, not restrict you. They keep your mind from harmful

           thoughts.
                 (beat)
           Drink your tea.
Drew nods and sips at his tea.
EXT. TRAINING AREA ­ DAY
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF ONE OF THE INSTRUCTORS TEACHING A SOFT STYLE OF
SHAOLIN WU SHU.
His body moves with the wind, bending and swaying. Another monk is
attacking him with a hard style, and the soft style is very
effective.
Drew and Li try it, and Drew is having a lot of trouble. He is used
to training hard style, and the soft style seems too weak for him.
D.S. comes over.

                       DREW

           It's not fighting ­ I feel like I'm dancing or
           something... This soft stuff is unnatural ­ Fighting
           should be hard, tough...

The D.S. holds out his hand, in a tight fist.

                       D.S.

           If my hand was always like this, what would you call it?

                       DREW

                 (after a beat)

           Deformed.

He opens his hand, letting it go limp.

                       D.S.
           And if it was always like this?

                       DREW (CONT'D)
           Again, deformed.
The D.S. nods and walks off, leaving Drew to stare questioningly at
Li.
EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ DAY
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TEMPLE COURTYARD, WHERE ALL THE DISCIPLES ARE
COLLECTED.
They are not dressed in their monastic robes, however. They are in
street clothes.
It is their day off!
A monk comes down the line, handing out hats to the disciples. They

put them on, and wait for instructions from the D.S.
                     D.S.
           Remember, let no one know you are disciples at the
           Shaolin Temple, but do not forget that you are. Dzai
           Jyan.
They file out.
EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ SAME DAY
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THE DISCIPLES EXITING THE TEMPLE.
As soon as they are out, the serious faces break into smiles, and
they are teenagers again. Some of the disciples run off to join
relatives waiting for them in the courtyard, while a group of them
stick together.
Drew is walking with Li, Wu and several others.

ANGLE ON THE GROUP

As they walk through the small town outside of the temple.

They pass by Ashema's stand, but only the Bau Bau is there.

Drew bows to the Bau Bau, then slips off his hat, rubbing his bald
head for Bau Bau to see. Bau Bau laughs, and the rest of the guys
rush up to Drew, forcing his hat back on his head.

                     LI

           Drew! We're not supposed to...

                     DREW

           Chill out, guys! It's our day off!

He bows to Bau Bau and then they walk off.

They walk through the small town, checking it out.
They walk through the countryside, enjoying their freedom.

Drew has brought a frisbee with him, and they are tossing it around.
EXT. LUOYANG CAVES ­ SAME DAY
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF GROUP AS THEY WALK IN THE HILLS HOUSING THE
FAMOUS LUO YANG CAVES.
The hills are filled with Buddhist carvings.
ANGLE ON CARVINGS ­ INTERCUT
ANGLE ON DREW

As he walks by the carvings. The detail and the artistry are amazing.
EXT. RIVERSIDE ­ SAME DAY
ANGLE ON DREW AND GROUP

As they walk by a riverside park. The park is filled with people, and
a group of kids swinging into the river on a rope. Drew stops to
watch them, then looks back at the others.
They all shake their heads.
Drew nods his.
They continue to shake their heads.
Drew starts running towards the kids, stripping off his shirt at the
same time. The others pause for a moment, then follow his lead.
ANGLE ON GROUP
As they swing into the river, trying to keep their hats on as they
splash into the water. they are having the time of their life.
ANGLE ON GROUP

Resting on the bank of the river. Drew and the guys spot a group of
girls down the bank from them.

                     DREW

           Check it out, guys!

                     WU

           Girls!

                     DREW

           Good work, Wu. What tipped you off?

                     LI

                  (alarmed)

           We are not allowed to have contact with females. It is
           the most serious rule of the temple.

                     DREW

           It's a stupid rule, Li. But...
He is about to turn away, then spots Ashema as she runs down a path
to the group of girls. He stands up immediately and starts over to
her. He is jogging, at the same time trying to straighten his clothes
and his hat.
Li starts running after Drew. The others follow.
                     DREW (CONT'D)
           ASHEMA!

ANGLE ON ASHEMA
Who hears her name. She looks around, sees Drew but doesn't
immediately recognize him. She looks around the park.

                     DREW (CONT'D)
           ASHEMA! Here!
She looks at Drew again, and this time recognizes him. Drew arrives
and impulsively he gives her a hug, genuinely very happy to see her.
Li arrives and pulls them apart.
                     DREW (CONT'D)
           What!?!
                     LI
           You can get kicked out of the temple for this...
                     DREW
           Who's going to tell, Li? You?

He turns to Ashema, who has now backed off a little bit and is
looking at Drew, a smile on her face, but is pretending that she is
embarrassed. The other girls are gathered around, giggling.

                     DREW

                 (pointing at girls)

           Not the giggle girls again! How've you been? You look
           great!

                     ASHEMA

                 (hiding a laugh)

           You look... funny.

                     DREW (CONT'D)

           Thanks.

                     ASHEMA

           How do you like the temple?
                     DREW

           Shhh... nobody's supposed to know.
Li tugs at Drew's shirt.
                     LI
           We really shouldn't be doing this...
                     DREW

           I'm trying to show you guys a good time.
                 (to Ashema)
           I guess I gotta go. It was great to see you.

One of the giggle girls behind Ashema whispers something in her ear.
She nods and smiles.
                      ASHEMA
           My school is having a party this Tuesday night. Can you
           and your friends come?
Li and the guys immediately hem and haw their negative replies, but
Drew smiles and takes Ashema's hand. The girls start to giggle again.
He brings her hand up to his lips, and kisses it gently.
                      DREW
           We'll be there.
INT. DORM ROOM ­ NIGHT
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DORM ROOM, LI STANDING IN FRONT OF DREW, THE
REST OF THE DISCIPLES GATHERED AROUND.

The room is dark ­ it's after lights out.

                      LI

           Are you nuts? We can't go to a party, with GIRLS!

                      DREW

           Why not? We're working hard, we deserve some R & R.

                      LI

           'R & R'?

                      DREW

           We've earned this. Back home in New York, you don't say
           no to a party... Where's your sense of adventure?

                      WU

           What do you do at a 'party' with girls?

Drew smiles, knowing that he has them.
                      DREW
           You dance, and talk. And have a good time.
                      LI
           That clinches it, we can't dance.

                      WU
           And we don't know how to talk to girls...
                      DREW

                 (trying to sound like an expert)
           That's easy. You just talk to them like you would to the

              guys ­ you just don't tell them as much, and... not in
              the same way...
Drew is in over his head.
                       GAO
              Like you know?
                       DREW
              Look, dancing's easy. I'll show you. We'll start with
              slow dancing.
An OOOH escapes from the guys.
                       DREW (CONT'D)
              Dirty dancing!

Giggles now. Drew pulls his boom box out of his backpack, and starts
searching for a suitable tape.

                       DREW (CONT'D)

              You guys grab a pillow for a partner, while I find some
              slow music.

The disciples have grabbed their pillows. Drew pops the cassette into
his boom box and turns it on, low and sultry.

                       DREW (CONT'D)

              Just move in time to the music, nothing elaborate. Think
              of it as a soft form...

The disciples move and sway in time to the music. They are treating
their pillows like imaginary girls.

ANGLE ON LI

Who is holding his pillow at arm's length.

DREW WALKS BY LI
                       DREW (CONT'D)
              Loosen up, Li. She's not going to bite!
                       LI
              How do you know?

ANGLE ON WU
Who is really getting into it. He is dancing with his pillow cheek to
cheek, and occasionally sneaking a kiss.
ANGLE ON OTHER MONKS
Practicing their dancing and preparing for the party.
ANGLE ON DREW

Who sits back on his bed, his hands clasped behind his head.
                     DREW
           This is going to be great...
ANGLE ON DISCIPLES
Still moving and swaying to the music.
                                                 DISSOLVE TO:
INT. DORM ROOM ­ NIGHT
ANGLE ON DISCIPLES
Now asleep and in bed, still clutching their pillows like they were
girls.
ANGLE ON DOOR

As it opens. The D.S. looks in on the room, and sees all the kids
holding their pillows. He shakes his head and then closes the door.

EXT. TRAINING AREA ­ DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TWO BODIES FIGHTING, KICKING AND PUNCHING.

CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL Drew and Gao going at it. The other
disciples are paired off as well, but the only real action is here in
this ring.

Drew is getting tagged, hard, while the points he scores are all
relatively controlled. After one particularly powerful shot, Drew
stops.

                     DREW

           I thought this was light contact!

                     GAO

           Fight, you coward!
Drew stares at Gao, then looks around for the D.S. He is over at the
other side of the training area.
                     DREW

           You got it.
Before he can move, however, Gao attacks, slamming him full power in
the face. Drew almost falls to the ground, then attacks him and the
battle is joined.
The fighting is fast and furious, and soon the others see what is
happening, and gather around. One of the monks comes over and tries
to break it up, but they continue fighting, wrestling, kicking and
punching.

The D.S. finally gets over to them, and without moving a muscle,
barks ­

                      D.S.
           Stop!
Drew and Gao immediately break apart, breathing heavy and staring
daggers at each other.
                      D.S.
                   (to others)
           Back to work.
He turns and walks off, motioning for Drew and Gao to follow him.
Drew follows immediately, with Gao behind him. Gao shoves him once.
INT. SAN DE CHAMBER ­ SAME DAY
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW, GAO AND SAN DE IN THE SHADOWS OF SAN DE'S
ROOM.

San De is sitting down reading a Buddhist text. With a sigh, he puts
it down. On the wall behind is hanging a Golden Sash.

                      SAN DE

           So soon?

                   (beat)

           Tell me what happened.

Drew looks at Gao, and Gao looks at Drew. There is a pause, one that
is very uncomfortable. Finally, Drew speaks.

                      DREW

           It was my fault. I started it.

ANGLE ON GAO

Surprised at Drew's confession.

                      DREW (CONT'D)
           Disciple Gao was better than me.
Drew pauses, and Gao is even more surprised at the revelation.
                      DREW (CONT'D)
           I lost my temper. He was only defending himself.

ANGLE ON SAN DE
Who nods his head and looks at Drew.
                      SAN DE

           Is this true, Disciple Gao?
Gao looks at Drew, wondering what he should say. Drew looks at him,
nodding for him to say yes.

                      GAO
           Yes. But, I am not completely blameless...
                      SAN DE
           I didn't think you were...
                    (beat)
           The Shaolin martial tradition is built on challenges. We
           challenge ourselves, but we do not fight with each other.
           Never do we fight to see who is best ­ we train to be
           able to right wrongs, not to let our hands and feet
           express emotions run wild. A Shaolin never throws a punch
           or kick in anger.
                    (beat)
           Shake hands and let your emotions go.

Gao looks at Drew, knowing that the anger is already long gone, swept
away in the shock of Drew taking the blame.

They shake hands.

Both Drew and Gao notice the Golden Sash hanging on the wall. It is
occupying a place of honor.

                      SAN DE (CONT'D)

           That is the Golden Sash, the highest honor of the temple.
           It is awarded to the monk who has attained the pinnacle
           of understanding.

                      DREW

           The best fighter?

                      SAN DE

           Among other things. Fighting is only a small part of
           being a Shaolin monk.
                      GAO

           Yours?
San De nods.
                      SAN DE

           Return to your training.
Drew and Gao get up, bow to San De and head for the door.
They get to the door at the same time, however, and for a moment they
jockey for position, trying to be the first one through the door.

Finally, Drew tires of the game and opens the door for Gao.
                      DREW

              Ten more seconds and I would have kicked your ass...
Gao smiles and walks through the door. Just as he passes Drew, he
punches him in the stomach.
                          GAO
              In your dreams...
INT. DORM ROOM ­ DAY
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DISCIPLES GETTING READY TO GO OUT.
They are dressed in "street" clothes and are just pulling on their
hats. Drew, instead of wearing his temple-issue hat, pulls on a New
York Yankees baseball cap!
                          DREW
              Now, we're ready!

He leads them towards the window of their dorm, but stops when he
gets there. He turns to where Gao is standing, all alone.

                          DREW (CONT'D)

              Gao, you coming or what?

There is a moment of indecision, then Gao frowns, shakes his head and
comes jogging towards them.

                          GAO

              I'm coming, just to keep you out of trouble!

EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ SAME NIGHT

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF EMPTY COURTYARD BATHED IN MOONLIGHT.

Suddenly, a figure lands on the ground with a PUFF of dust.

In a crouch, Drew scans the area, then motions for the others to jump
down.

Immediately, other figures land with PUFFs of dust all around him. As
soon as they have all landed, they move off.

ANGLE ON GROUP
As they    sneak    through the courtyards and training areas of the
temple.    They    are about halfway across from the front door of the
temple    when a    monk comes walking towards them. He is weaving and
bobbing    ­ he    looks drunk.

Drew shoots Li and Gao a questioning look. Drunk? In the temple?
They take refuge behind a couple of the columns and watch as the monk
makes his way past, weaving and throwing kicks and punches. It is a
tense moment as the monk comes uncomfortably close to where Drew and
Gao are standing, but he walks on.

                          GAO

                 (whisper)
           Drunken Kung Fu...
Drew nods and leads them out of the temple.
EXT. TEMPLE ­ SAME NIGHT
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF GROUP AS THEY HEAD DOWN THE DARK STREETS OF THE
TOWN. EUPHORIA STRIKES, AND THEY ARE HAVING FUN (AD LIBS HERE) JUST
BEING FREE AND A.W.O.L.
EXT. GIRL'S SCHOOL ­ SAME NIGHT
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF FRONT OF GIRL'S SCHOOL.
It is the same school where Drew first met Ashema. The guys, still
happy, arrive at the school, and the realization of what they are
about to do sinks in.

They stop talking and are staring at the building. Drew starts toward
the door, and nobody follows his lead. He stops and motions for them
to join him. Nobody moves.

                    DREW

           Are we men or are we sheep?

A beat, then the entire group bellows:

                    GROUP

           SHEEP!

And they follow Drew, the shepherd, in through the front door, making
noises like sheep.

INT. PARTY ROOM ­ SAME NIGHT

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF PARTY.

It isn't happening. The boys are on one side, the girls are on the
other. The music is bad Chinese rock and roll.

The only ones together are Drew and Ashema, who are talking in the
center of the room. The disciples are all clustered together, staring
at the walls and the ceiling. A group of giggle girls are standing
around Drew and Ashema.
A group of toughs are standing at one side of the party room,
observing everything that's going on.
ANGLE ON DREW AND ASHEMA
                    DREW
           Great party...

Ashema smiles a sheepish smile. Drew decides that if they are going
to have a good time, he's going to have a hand in it. He pulls out a
cassette tape, gives it to Ashema

                      DREW (CONT'D)
           Play this when I signal, OK?
She nods and walks off. Drew motions for Gao and the guys to come
over. They do, and when they do, Drew turns to the giggle girls
                      DREW (CONT'D)
           Ladies, allow me to introduce my best friends in all of
           China...
He drags Gao over to one of the prettier girls.
                      DREW (CONT'D)
           This is Gao. And this wild man is Li...
Drew does the same for Li, Wu, Su, Sou and all the others, forcing
them to stand with the girls for a moment. When everyone is paired
off, he motions to Ashema.

                      DREW (CONT'D)

           Hit it!

INSERT of Ashema's finger on the tape player "PLAY" button.

ANGLE ON THE ROOM

As the song the disciples have been singing in the fields blasts out.
Immediately, the disciples start moving with the music, and suddenly
the

Party is happening.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

ANGLE ON DISCIPLES

Who are now slow dancing to a romantic melody ­ some holding the
girls closer than others. Drew and Ashema are locked in an embrace,
their eyes closed.

A hand comes in and taps Drew on the shoulder.
                      DREW
                    (eyes still closed)
           Not now, Li...
The hand comes in again, punching Drew in the shoulder hard.

Drew opens his eyes, and sees that he is surrounded by five tough
guys, dressed in dark clothes and with sunglasses on.

                      DREW (CONT'D)
           What can I do for you?
                      TOUGH

           Leave.
ANGLE ON DISCIPLES.
They have noticed what is going on.
ANGLE ON DREW
                      DREW
           No, thanks.
He turns back to Ashema, but she is pulled back by the giggle girls,
away from danger.
The tough spins Drew around and pushes him HARD. One of the toughs
has already gotten behind him, on his knees, and Drew goes flipping
over the tough, landing hard on the ground, the wind knocked out of
him.

Drew gets up, wincing, not really ready to fight.

                      DREW (CONT'D)

           Can't we talk this over?

The tough pulls his fist back to strike Drew, who has been grabbed by
two other toughs, his arms pinned behind his back.

Suddenly, a figure FLIES in and SLAMS the tough to the ground.

It is Gao, and he immediately sets on the other toughs. The room
ERUPTS in a melee as the disciples go at it with the village toughs.

The girls are SCREAMING as the boys kick and punch.

The disciples are winning, having a great time, until the door to the
room SLAMS open and the HEADMISTRESS comes storming in, screaming at
the top of her lungs for them to stop.

ANGLE ON DREW, GAO AND THE DISCIPLES

As they all agree as one to hightail out of there. They go running
past the Headmistress and out the door, full speed.

EXT. GIRLS SCHOOL ­ SAME NIGHT
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DISCIPLES SPRINTING THROUGH THE DARKNESS.
EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ SAME NIGHT

ANGLE ON THE DISCIPLES
As they climb back into the dorm room.
INT. DORM ROOM ­ SAME NIGHT
ESTABLISHING SHOT AS THE LAST DISCIPLE CLIMBS THROUGH THE WINDOW ­ IT
IS DREW.
He lands on the hardwood floor, panting his lungs out after the run.
After a BEAT, he lifts his head and looks right at Gao.

                      DREW
              Did you say you were going to keep us OUT of trouble?
The group pauses for a BEAT, then they all laugh, relaxing.
INT. DINNER ROOM ­ DAY
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF GAO CARRYING A PLATE OF CHINESE FOOD OVER TO A
TABLE WHERE THE DISCIPLES EATING, THEIR EYES SCANNING THE ROOM FOR
SIGNS OF WARNING.
Gao sits down and looks around. They are all dressed in their
training clothes, dirtied after a full day of training.
                      GAO
              I can't believe nobody's said anything! It's been a whole
              day!

                      LI

              We broke every major rule the temple has, how could we
              get away with it?

                      DREW

              I think we might have. If they knew, they'd have already
              gotten us! You guys just have to stop looking so guilty.

ANGLE ON WU

Who pushes his dinner away from him.

                      WU

              I've lost my appetite.

                      DREW

              Let's go back to the dorm for a few minutes, go over our
              stories in case they seperate us...

He gets up to leave, and the others follow him.
                      LI

              Seperate us?
EXT. COURTYARD ­ SAME DAY
IN THE COURTYARD ARE SEVERAL POLICEMEN, WAITING AROUND.
Drew and the others spot the cops, and walk quickly to their dorm
room.
INT. DORM ROOM ­ SAME DAY
DREW AND THE OTHERS ARE FRANTIC.

                      DREW

           Cops! Somebody called the cops?!?
Before anyone can answer, the door opens and the D.S. walks into the
room, his face serious.
                     D.S.
           Drew! Come with me to San De's chamber...
He turns to go, but the others are on their feet, ready to follow
Drew.
                     D.S.
           Just Drew.
Drew looks at them and shrugs, then follows the D.S.
INT. SAN DE CHAMBER ­ EVENING

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF SAN DE AND THE GIRLS SCHOOL HEADMISTRESS.

Also in the room are two high-ranking police officials. The
Headmistress is yelling at the top of her lungs, and San De is just
sitting there, letting her vent. She has obviously been going at it
for some time, because her face is sweaty and flushed. She stops when
Drew and the D.S. enter and points an accusing finger at Drew.

                     HEADMISTRESS

           He's the one!

                     SAN DE

           Drew, I think you know Headmistress Low. Correct?

Drew can only nod.

                     SAN DE (CONT'D)

           The police have also come. A morals violation is what
           brought them...

Drew's head snaps up at the words "morals charge"
                     POLICE LIEUTENANT
           We demand that he leaves the temple, and China!
                     POLICE CAPTAIN
           He's a disgrace, to the temple and to this country. He
           must leave.
They all agree that Drew should leave, and for a moment the sound of
the three of them agreeing fills the room (ad libs).
ANGLE ON DREW
Who is staring down into the abyss.
                     SAN DE

           This is a serious issue, there is no question. This we
           will have to take under advisement ­ but we will handle
           matters of this temple.
                    POLICE CAPTAIN
           This involves more than just the temple. I am authorized
           to escort him from your temple to the jail now, tonight,
           where he will be held until he leaves the country.
San De pauses, letting this sink in. The D.S. steps forward.
                    D.S.
           Master, may I?
                 (San De nods)
           We accepted a challenge when this disciple came into our
           ranks. If we force him to leave China, we admit failure.
           Can we do that?

The police don't have an easy answer to that.

ANGLE ON DREW

Who is surprised that the d.s. is sticking up for him.

                    D.S.

           You are wise. You know what is right and what is not
           right. This disciple does not even know right from wrong.
           Who will teach him if we do not?

This sinks in, and the police have nothing to say. The Headmistress
will not keep quiet, however.

                    HEADMISTRESS

           He does not belong here!

                    DREW

                 (whisper)
           Chill out, honey!
Drew catches a hard look from the D.S.

                    D.S.
           Would you be so hard hearted as to turn him away from
           that which he so desperately needs?
She is about to speak, but thinks better of it.
San De stands up, signalling that the meeting is over.
                    SAN DE
           Thank you all for coming. I am pleased that you brought
           this problem to our attention. May you sleep well tonight

           knowing that the situation has been swiftly resolved.
                      POLICE CAPTAIN
           I do not wish to visit you again with this kind of news.
                      SAN DE
           You will not have to.
The Headmistress starts to say something, but San De holds up his
hand, stopping her. He leads them out, then closes the door and comes
back to face Drew.
                      DREW
           Master, I can't tell you how sorry I am. I appreciate you
           both going to bat like that for me. I won't let it happen
           again.

                      SAN DE

           Neither will we. You must leave the temple in the
           morning.

                      DREW

           But I thought... the police...

                      D.S.

           You do not deserve to leave the country as a criminal,
           but you cannot stay.

Drew sits for a moment, looking back and forth between San De and the
D.S. His eyes are filling with tears, and he wipes at them.

                      DREW (CONT'D)

           I'm sorry, Master.

                      SAN DE

           As am I.
Drew gets up and walks out of the chamber.

He has just finished telling the disciples what is going on.

They are shocked.
                      GAO
           Why only you?

Drew shrugs and goes over to his bed, lying down with a sigh.
                     LI
           The D.S. always told us that we're all responsible for
           what happens.
                     WU
           It's not fair.
                     DREW
           It doesn't have to be fair...

York Yankees cap and shoulders his back pack, then looks around the

                     DREW

           I hate long goodbyes anyway...

He exits the room.

EXT. SHAOLIN COURTYARD ­ SAME DAY

ANGLE ON DREW
Walking through the courtyard, for the last time. Only a few monks

The sounds of training can be heard O.S. Drew stops to listen to
those sounds for a moment, then heads for the door.
EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ SAME DAY
ANGLE ON DREW
As he leaves the temple. He pauses for a moment with the door open,
then shuts it sadly. He looks out over the courtyard, which is
completely deserted. Drew sighs, hitches his backpack onto his back
and starts out.
As he comes out of the doorway and into the courtyard proper, he
sees...
THE ENTIRE CLASS OF DISCIPLES

Dressed in street clothes with their bags packed. Li and Gao are in
the front, their bags in their hands, smiling.
                    GAO
           You're either with us or against us, remember?
                    DREW
                 (smiling)
           I'm with you!
A cheer goes up from the entire group as Drew, Li and Gao embrace. In
the b.g. can be seen the D.S., who is observing all this.
INT. SAN DE CHAMBER ­ DAY
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF SAN DE'S CHAMBER, SAN DE WAITING FOR DREW IN ONE
OF THE CHAIRS.

The door opens and Drew walks in, the D.S. can be seen in the b.g.
San De indicates one of the chairs for him to sit in. He does.

                    SAN DE

           Quite a show of solidarity, yes?

Drew nods, trying to hide a smile. He is trying his best to appear
humble.

                    SAN DE (CONT'D)

           Why did you come to the Shaolin Temple?

                    DREW

                 (caught off guard)

           To train, Master.

                    SAN DE (CONT'D)

           Yet you rebel at every rule, and blame the training for
           your inability to learn and progress?
No response from Drew, who is just looking down at the ground.
                    SAN DE (CONT'D)

           You are like someone swimming in fresh water crying "I
           thirst!". What you seek is all around you. Don't fight
           with the ways of the temple, the battle is within
           yourself.
                    DREW

           Within myself?
                    SAN DE
           You must accept the responsibility for your life. If we
           force you out of the temple, you can always blame the

           temple for your failure ­ it never has to be your fault.
                 (beat)
           Life without committment is no life at all.
                    DREW
           What if I can't handle it? What if I fail?
                    SAN DE
           Live for the moment, Drew. The future will take care of
           itself. If you go through your days here, squeezing every
           last bit of life out of every minute, you need not fear
           failure.
                    DREW
                 (after a beat)

           Then, it's up to me.

                    SAN DE (CONT'D)

           Yes. Your fellow disciples stood up for you. It's your
           turn.

                    DREW

           I don't want to let them down.

                    SAN DE

           Don't let yourself down.

He bows to San De and then leaves the chamber.

EXT. CHAMBER ­ SAME NIGHT

DREW COMES OUT, FINDING GAO AND LI WAITING FOR HIM.

                    GAO
           Are you staying?

Drew waits for a moment, studying their hopeful faces.
                    DREW
           Yeah, I'm staying. If only to keep you guys out of
           trouble!
They walk off, and just as they round a corner, a BANG is heard as
one of the monks drops the heavy wooden lid of a storage barrell.
Drew jumps, spinning around in the direction of the sound.
                    LI

           Drew! Are you allright?
                    DREW

           Yeah, I'm just a little on edge, that's all. Ever since I
           got to the temple, some nut has been attacking me with a
           stick ­ at night, in the toilet... anywhere! It's driving
           me crazy...
Gao and Li look at each other, nodding.
                    DREW (CONT'D)
           What? Honest, it's happening! I...
                    GAO
           Every class of disciples, the one with the most potential
           is singled out for special training. We were wondering
           who it was... now, we know.
                    DREW
           Special training? You mean...?

Gao and Li nod, and Drew walks with them, shaking his head.

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE ­ MORNING

WATER RUSH BY.

In the b.g. comes Drew, dressed in his monastic robes, no hat on his
head. He is making no attempt to hide the fact that he is a monk.

Drew walks up to Ashema and takes her hand, and they stand like that
for a moment. She then turns to him, and starts to say something.
Drew stops her with a finger on her lips, then strokes her cheek.

                    DREW

           Ashema, beautiful Ashema, I can't see you anymore. I
           will... miss you and remember you... always.

Ashema closes her eyes against the tears there, and buries her head
against Drew's shoulder.

                    ASHEMA
           Are they making you do this?
She wants to hear that they are, even if it's not true. She NEEDS to
hear it.

Drew pulls her head away from his shoulder, looking into her eyes. It
would be so easy not to take the blame for hurting her like this.

                    DREW
           No. It is my choice, and my responsibility. I'm sorry...
He embraces her for the last time, and she openly begins to cry. He
holds her for a moment, then breaks the embrace and with one last
long look at Ashema, walks away.

is attacked! The staff comes out, but Drew manages to block it with
one of the buckets. The staff strikes again, and Drew blocks again! A
third time, and Drew raises both buckets over his head to block it ­

His attacker has vanished, leaving Drew alternately moaning from the

EXT. TRAINING AREA ­ DAY

ANGLE ON DREW AND LI
As they go through a very intricate, beautifully staged series of
techniques. The last technique is a very powerful kick, and one which

Gao's hands are around his elbow, pulling down.
                    D.S.
           Using your muscles, bend my arm.
Gao pulls down, while the D.S. tries to fight back with his muscles,
but finally, after great strain, his arm bends. A cheer goes up from
the group.
D.S. smiles and motions for an old monk standing near him to take his
place. the old man puts his arm up on Gao's shoulder, and takes a
deep breath. He does not tense up his arm and shoulder.

Gao looks questioning at the D.S.

                    GAO

           What if I hurt him?

                    D.S.

           You will not.

Gao starts to pull down, gently at first, but when he sees that the
old monk's arm is not bending, stronger, until finally he is putting
all his strength into it. The old monk's arm has not moved, and his
expression of relaxation and piece has not changed.

Gao quits, not able to bend the arm. D.S. motions for Drew to get on
the other side of the monk.

                    D.S.

           Grab his arms and try to pull him out of his stance.
Drew and Gao shrug at each other and take an arm. They pull and push,
straining and groaning, but there is no movement from the old monk.
It is like he is a heavy stone.
They give up, and the D.S. bows to the old monk.

points at his chest.

           Try to hit me here with your feet.
                       DREW

his head. Drew stands up, and the staff comes again, from a different
direction. Drew avoids, and the staff finds empty air again.

Drew goes on with cleaning the plates, a slight smile on his face.
After a BEAT, he looks around, trying to find the attacker. When he
is sure no one is around, he smiles bigger.
                       DREW

position a wooden target. The monk bows    to D.S. and to the rest of
the disciples, then positions the point    of the spear in the hollow of
his neck. He then hands the shaft of the    spear to the D.S.

The D.S. holds the shaft and starts to push, bending the spear,
slowly but surely.

ANGLE ON DREW AND THE DISCIPLES
Amazed.

ANGLE ON THE MONK
The spear is now almost bent double.
With a flick of his head, the spear goes flying into the target
positioned behind him, its point finding the bulls-eye.

Drew walks over to the target and sees that the very real spear point
is imbedded deep into the wood of the target.

                      DREW

Set against a deep blue sky, it could be spinning anywhere ­ but the
CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the Shaolin Temple "forest of stupa",
where the disciples are having a pick up football game ­ it's Sunday,
the disciples' afternoon off. The football spins into the hands of
Gao, who drops it.
Drew runs over, showing Gao how to catch the ball, and how to make
the cuts he has to make (no dialogue, music over).
Gao follows Drew's instructions, then they run the play. This time
Gao is all alone and he catches the ball easily for a touchdown.
Drew runs up and high-fives Gao, then teaches him how to spike the

and puts his fingers on the laces.

                       SAN DE

           Go long.
Drew pauses for a moment, not sure    what San De said, until San De
motions with his left hand, like a    NFL quarterback, for Drew to go
out. He takes off sprinting, with    Gao covering him like a blanket.
San De throws the ball to him in a    perfect spiral, to a spot where
Gao has no play on the throw, and    Drew catches it in stride.
San De immediately returns to his meditation, while Drew and the
others stand around dumbstruck.
EXT. COUNTRYSIDE ­ DAY
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF GAO, LI AND DREW RUNNING THROUGH THE
COUNTRYSIDE.
They come to a stream, and there by a stream is a beautiful young
woman who can't get across the stream without getting her clothes
soaked.

Without thinking twice, Drew allows her to get on his back and
carries her across the river. He deposits her on the other side and
then continues running.

Gao and Li run up next to Drew, and together they go back to the
temple. When they stop outside the temple, they are breathing
heavily. finally catching his breath, Gao turns to Drew.

                       GAO

           I can't believe you carried that girl over the stream!
           After all the trouble you got into...

                       LI

           Are you crazy? You almost got kicked out once over that
           kind of thing...

Drew smiles slightly.

                       DREW

           I left that girl at the stream. Are you two still
           carrying her?
He turns and walks away, leaving Li and Gao to puzzle that one out.
As he walks away, San De comes out from behind a pillar where he had
been sweeping, smiling and nodding his head at Drew's answer.

techniques they    are throwing are full power. Drew hits Gao, and he
bends over. Drew    closes, thinking that he has Gao at his mercy. At
the last minute,    Gao stands up and cold cocks Drew, who sags to the

ground.

He comes at Gao, and they start fighting again, throwing all kinds of
acrobatic kicks and techniques.

A gong sounds, O.S., and Gao and Drew stop, bow to each other, and
then embrace, smiling.

                      DREW (CONT'D)

           Saved by the bell...

                      GAO

           I had you...

Drew moves off to the side to get a drink of water, and to towel off.
As he rubs his neck, D.S. comes up to him.

                      D.S.
           San De wants to see you, in his chambers.

Drew raises his eyebrows, then looks over at Gao and Li. He rolls up
his towel and snaps Gao with it as he walks by.

San De takes out a map of the area.

           This map will lead you to the Jade Mountain. Let nothing
           deter from safeguarding the sacred scroll. You leave
           first thing tomorrow morning.

                 (beat)

           You must return within three day... or don't bother to
           return at all.

San De stands and bows to Drew. Drew returns the bow, takes the map
and the box, then leaves the chamber.

EXT. TEMPLE ­ EARLY MORNING

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW WALKING OUT OF THE TEMPLE INTO THE MIST-
SHROUDED COURTYARD.

He is off on his quest.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE ­ SAME DAY

ANGLE ON DREW

Walking strong. the sun is high in the sky, and the scenery behind is
incredibly beautiful (Guilin?).
EXT. SMALL TOWN ­ SAME DAY
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW STOPPING IN A SMALL TOWN, IN THE MIDDLE OF
AN OPEN AIR MARKET.
He goes over to a drink stand, and buys a cool drink. Just as he is
about to drink it down, it is KNOCKED from his hand.
Drew turns around and see four dirty thugs and their leader ­ the one
who hit the glass. They are yelling at Drew in Chinese, which he
doesn't understand.
                    DREW

           OK, boys, just let me get my glass and...
Drew, not looking for trouble, bends down to pick up the glass, and
the leader kicks him in the rear end, sending him pitching to the

ground. Drew rolls to a standing position, and the five men close on
him.
A crowd is now starting to form, eager to watch how the monk handles
this situation.
The thugs come after Drew, and the leader throws a roundhouse punch,
hitting Drew square in the jaw. They continue to attack, while Drew
tries to avoid getting hit. Drew catches a haymaker, and he spins and
drops, and the thugs laugh, kick him a couple of times, and then kick
dust and dirt onto him. Drew doesn't get up.
They soon tire of the sport and move on, the crowd staring at Drew in
pity.
                       DREW (CONT'D)
                    (to himself)
              This humble, not fighting stuff is harder, and more
              painful, than it looks!

ANGLE ON THE THUGS

Who have now spotted a man and his young son. They are both loaded
down with goods from the store, and the thugs stop them. They take
the things from them, and start to walk off.

The father tries to fight back, but they easily beat him up, sending
him into the dirt. The young boy runs forward. The leader of the
thugs raises his hand, ready to slap the boy's face.

Before he can bring his arm forward, Drew's fingers come around his
wrist, stopping it.

                       DREW (CONT'D)

              Oh, I don't think so...

ANGLE ON THE CROWD

It's getting good now.
The fight    starts, and this    time Drew is unencumbered by    vows of non-
violence.    He has a cause,    and he's enjoying every minute    of the
fight. It    is over quickly,    as Drew is a superb fighter,    using
incredible    techniques. The    thugs limp away, leaving Drew    with the
little boy    and his father.

Drew bends down and picks up the goods, handing them back to the boy
and the father. Drew stops and kneels down in front of the boy,
looking deep into his eyes.
A whisper is going through the crowd: "Shaolin".
Drew touches the boy's cheek, smiles, then stands up and bows. He
moves on, the crowd watching him walk away.
HOLD ON BOY'S FACE
He now has a hero.

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE ­ DAY
ANGLE ON DREW WALKING THROUGH THE COUNTRYSIDE. HE STOPS AT A CROSSING
IN THE ROAD, CONSULTS THE MAP SAN DE GAVE HIM, THEN WALKS ON.
EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE ­ EVENING
ANGLE ON DREW
As he climbs the side of a mountain.
EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE TEMPLE ­ NIGHT
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW, MEDITATING NEXT TO HIS SMALL FIRE.
It is dark around him, with vague forms of the temple columns and
statues. Drew is sitting with his eyes closed, oblivious to his
surroundings.
EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE ­ NEXT DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW WORKING OUT NEXT TO A MOUNTAIN LAKE.

He is throwing kicks and going through his routines, concentrating on
his breathing. As he finishes a particularly strenuous series, he
strips off his clothes and dives into the lake.

As Drew's head breaks the surface of the lake, he is surprised to see
a beautiful woman standing next to where he left his clothes.

Drew starts to get out of the lake, then remembers that he is naked ­
he stops, not quite knowing what to do. He goes as close to the shore
as he can without coming out of the water.

The woman just smiles, and starts to strip off what clothing she has
on. She is very sexy.

                      DREW

           No, don't do that!

                      WOMAN
           Why not?

                      DREW
           I'm a monk. I've taken a vow to abstain...
                      WOMAN

           No one will know...
                      DREW
           I'll know! Throw me my clothes, please.
Pouting, the woman takes Drew's pants and tosses them to him, but
they land (purposely) about 5 feet away from the lake edge.
                      DREW (CONT'D)

           Nice throw...
ANGLE ON DREW
Who realizes he is going to have to get out of the water without a
cover. He gets up and hurries to where his pants are. He starts to
put them on, and the woman is all over him, trying to seduce him.
He takes her hands in his and forces her to look him in the eye.
                    DREW (CONT'D)
           Despite the fact that this is every teenage boy's dream
           come true, I can't!
He lowers her hands, and her head drops, pouting.
                    DREW (CONT'D)
           Besides, if I were to break my vows, it would not be with
           you.

He kisses her on the forehead, and then grabs the rest of his
clothes, running up the path away from the lake.

EXT. TEMPLE ­ SAME DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF VERY ORNATE TEMPLE.

Drew walks up to the front of the temple, looks around for a moment,
then takes a drink of water from the well out front.

Just as he starts to drink, a huge TOUR BUS pulls up in front, air
brakes HISSING. Before he can react, the doors open and a bunch of
AMERICAN TOURISTS pile out of the bus and rush into the temple,
jostling Drew from side to side.

                    TOURIST 1

           Not another temple!

                    TOURIST 2
           Do they have a gift shop?

                    TOURIST 3
           Guide! How do you say 'gift shop'?
                    GUIDE

           You have 10 minutes to be back on the bus.
The wave of tourists passes Drew, and he stands there looking after
them. Then, as a group, they realize that they just passes a monk,
and turn back to Drew.
                    TOURIST 1
           A real live monk! Somebody, take my picture!

The tourist runs up to where Drew is and stands next to him. The
cameras click and whirr, and Drew is thoroughly embarrassed. When the

first pictures are over, and someone else wants to stand next to him,
he raises his hands up to his face and bows.
                    DREW
           Oh Mi Two Fwo
He then turns and walks away.
                    GUIDE (O.S.)
           Monks don't like to be bothered, they are from a
           different world.
                    DREW
           I'll say...
EXT. WATERFALL ­ EARLY MORNING

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THUNDERING WATERFALL.

Drew stands at the side of the waterfall, studying his map. From his
expression, we know that he has to go through the waterfall to get
where he is going.

Drew pockets the map, checks that the box is safely in place, then
starts toward the waterfall. The drop off the side of the waterfall
is incedible ­ steep and deadly.

ANGLE ON DREW

As he enters the waterfall. The water hits his back, almost pitching
him into the abyss. Drew concentrates and moves forward, slowly but
surely.

He emerges on the other side, only to be confronted by a swamp.
Jutting out of the swamp are rocks and tree stumps.

Drew examines the distance between the objects, realizing that he can
jump from place to place and make it across.

                    DREW

           Just like at the temple...
He starts out, jumping onto the first stone, then moving on to the
others. He almost falls a couple of times, but regains his balance.
He gets a rythm going, and is soon almost halfway across.
He gets to one particular rock, only to find out that it's the head
of an alligator! Its mouth opens to bite him!
Drew jumps off it quickly, onto a tree stump. When he lands on the
stump, he examines it carefully to make sure it isn't something else.
He continues across, more careful this time.

EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE ­ SAME DAY
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW CLIMBING UP THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN.
It is much steeper now, and the going is much tougher.

ANGLE ON DREW
As he comes up onto a rope bridge over a deep gorge, the way to the
arhat. Drew smiles, stashes the map and starts across the rope
bridge, hand over hand. He looks down once, at the DROP, then forces
himself to look straight ahead.
He just starts across when the rope bends and jumps. Drew turns
around to see a man RIGHT BEHIND HIM.
                      DREW
           Is this rope strong enough for both of us?
No answer from the man, who is now pushing Drew to go faster. He is
inching up closer to him, and occassionally kicking him to go
quicker.
                      DREW (CONT'D)

           OK, OK, I'm going!

ANGLE ON THE ROPE BEHIND THEM

Which is starting to fray from the weight.

ANGLE ON DREW

Who sees that and is hurrying.

The rope is fraying more, and when Drew is almost there, the rope
snaps and they both go swinging into the side of the mountain.

ANGLE ON DREW

Who slams into the wall hard. when he hits, the scroll POPS out of
his pocket and goes up in the air.

Drew, groggy from the impact, manages to lash out and PIN the scroll
to the cliff wall with the BACK of his hand.

ANGLE ON MAN

Who is barely hanging on, just below Drew.
He has his hand out to Drew for help.
ANGLE ON DREW

Who doesn't know what to do. If he tries to save the scroll, the man
might fall. If he goes for the man, the box will certainly fall.

ANGLE ON THE MAN
Screaming for help.
                      DREW (CONT'D)
           Hold on...
Drew hears the headmaster's voice.

                    SAN DE (O.S.)
           The scroll that is in this box is more precious than
           life. Guard it well.
He looks down at the man, who is about to lose it.
                    DREW
           What the heck...
Drew reaches down for the man's hand, letting the box fall.
Their hands meet, and Drew pulls him up.
ANGLE ON BOX
As it spins down into the abyss.
ANGLE ON DREW AND MAN

As Drew pulls him up onto his back, and carries him up the rope to
the other side of the gorge.

INT. MAN'S HOUSE ­ SAME DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW EATING WITH THE MAN HE SAVED.

They look at each other and smile, but Drew is anything but happy.

           What am I going to tell the arhat?

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW WALKING UP THE PATH TO THE ARHAT'S CAVE.

There is no bounce to his step, and he is dreading this audience.

Drew walks up to the entrance, looks around. He doesn't see anyone.
He walks into the hut.
INT. ARHAT HUT ­ EVENING
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF HUT AS DREW WALKS INTO THE HUT ­ NO ONE IS
AROUND.
He walks through the rooms, looking at all the books and scrolls
littered around the room.
                    DREW
           Maybe he won't miss one little scroll...
He shakes his head and starts for the front door.

EXT. ARHAT HUT ­ SAME EVENING

DREW COMES OUT OF THE HUT AND WALKS AROUND TO THE AREA BEHIND THE
HUT, HIGH UP ON THE MOUNTAIN.
The view is incredible. Drew stands looking at the view, and slowly
becomes aware of a figure sitting on the ground near him.
He looks down, and it is the ARHAT!
                    DREW
           Master! I apologize, I did not see you.
The Arhat says nothing, but just puts out his hand for the scroll.
Drew bows again, and gets down on his knees.
                    DREW (CONT'D)
           I failed, Master. A person was in danger...
The Arhat holds up his hand, and Drew stops talking.

                    DREW (CONT'D)

           Of course, you're right. No excuses...

Drew bows once more and is ready to leave. The Arhat reaches into his
robes and pulls out the embroidered box that Drew was given at the
temple.

                    DREW (CONT'D)

           You have it? How?

The Arhat holds up the box in front of Drew for a moment, then tears
it in two with his hands, scattering the pieces to the winds.

                    DREW (CONT'D)

           So, I didn't fail, huh?

                 (beat)

           I can ask my question, then?

The Arhat sits without moving or speaking. Drew takes that as a yes.
                    DREW (CONT'D)
           What is the meaning of life?

The Arhat ponders that for a moment, then smiles and puts his sandles
on his head and stands up.

                    ARHAT
           What is life? What is reality? The head of a dead cat.
He walks off, leaving Drew sitting there, dumbstruck by the answer.
                    DREW
                 (smiling ruefully)

           I just climbed a mountain to ask a loon about the meaning
           of life.
He shakes his head and gets up, following the Arhat. The Arhat is
standing on the other side of his hut, the sandles still on his head.
                      ARHAT
           For forty years, Shaolin disciples have made their quest
           to deliver a scroll to me. You are not Chinese.
                      DREW
           No. American.
                      ARHAT
           I notice the littlest details.
                      DREW

           How many succeeded?

                      ARHAT

           A handful. You chose correctly. Nothing is more precious
           than human life.

                      DREW

           But, I didn't obey.

                      ARHAT

                 (smiling slightly)

           At the beginning of your training, you were to obey
           without question. Now, as you become a Shaolin, you must
           learn to question everything, and obey yourself.

Drew and the monk bow to each other, the sunset over the mountain in
the b.g.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. ARHAT HUT ­ NEXT MORNING

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW COMING OUT OF THE HUT, HAVING JUST GOTTEN
UP.
The Arhat is already out there, moving through his gong fu moves.
                      DREW

           I have to leave. What is the easiest way to get back to
           the temple.

                      ARHAT
           The bus.
Drew laughs at the crazy reply and starts for the mountain path that
brought him to the hut. The Arhat runs after him, grabs his sleeve

and pulls him over to a place behind his hut.
DREW'S POV OF A ROAD BEHIND THE ARHAT'S HUT
A road! After all he went through to get there?
                    ARHAT (CONT'D)
           Bus stops every 20 min., will take you straight to the
           temple.
Drew smiles and shakes his head, then bows to the Arhat.
The Arhat returns the bow.
                    DREW
           Thank you, Master.
                    ARHAT

           They should give you a bus schedule with that map...

He walks off to the hut, while Drew makes his way down to the bus
stop.

EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ DAY

He is dirty, weary but triumphant. As he walks back through the
temple to San De's chambers to report, he sees a group of people
walking out the other way.

The group is made up of the thugs who attacked him, the woman by the

           We've got to rebuild this?
                      D.S.
           No.
                  (beat)

grabs the staff and PULLS.
Out comes the D.S. into the night on the other end of the staff. He
looks proudly at Drew.

                    SAN DE
           Only one trial remains before you become full fledged
           fighting monks. The Wooden Man Chamber.
ANGLE ON THE DISCIPLES
They are remembering the stories they have heard about the chamber.

                    SAN DE (CONT'D)

           I warn you all, any monk who fails must leave the temple
           forever, and will NEVER be called Shaolin.

San De pauses, letting this remark sink in.

                    SAN DE (CONT'D)

           Disciple Drew Carson, as you will return to America, and
           never intended to live as a monk in the temple, you need
           not enter the chamber.

ANGLE ON DREW

Who rises to the challenge.

                    DREW

           Master San De, I am part of the disciple class, am I not?

San De nods.

                    DREW (CONT'D)
           Then I must pass this final test. Furthermore, I request
           that I be the first one through.
                    SAN DE
                 (very proud)
           Your request is granted.

ANGLE ON DREW
In front of the entrance to the Wooden Man Chamber. San De and D.S.
are flanking Drew as he pauses in front of the door. Drew turns to
look at San De, and the D.S. smacks Drew in the back of the head.
                    DREW (CONT'D)

           What did you do that for?
                       D.S.
           My last chance ­ when you come out the other side, we
           will be equals.
Drew smiles at the D.S.'s attempt to lighten him up. He turns to look
at the others from his disciple class, then opens the door and goes
through.
INT. WOODEN MAN CHAMBER ­ SAME DAY
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF WOODEN MAN CHAMBER.
Drew pauses for a moment,      examining the room. It is filled with
wooden statues of monks,      all in different fighting positions. The
carvings are precise and      incredibly beautiful. Their arms, open
hands, fists and legs are      fashioned out of hard wood, and they look
very dangerous indeed.

Drew gathers himself for a moment, then starts into the chamber.

ANGLE ON DREW'S FOOT

As it presses down on one of the stones of the floor.

The attacks start ­ from all sides, as the wooden statues COME TO
LIFE, spinning, lunging and striking.

Drew is caught off guard, and is hit several times, driven back to
the door of the chamber. The statues stop moving.

Drew, a little scared, tries to remember the sequence of the statues,
letting his arms practice for the attacks.

There is fear in his eyes.

He starts in again, and the attacks come again, but they are
different this time.

Drew is clobbered.

Driven back to the door, Drew slumps against the wall. His face is
already bruised and bleeding.
                       DREW
                    (whispering)
           I can't do it.
FLASHBACK TO D.S.

                       D.S.
           There is no can't, only won't.
FLASHBACK TO SEVERAL D.S. ATTACKS

Including the one where Drew succeeded in evading them.

ANGLE ON DREW
Who gathers himself, straightens up and takes a deep breath, forcing
it out in a breathing exercise.
                    DREW (CONT'D)
           I am a Shaolin monk.
He enters the chamber again, and the attacks start again.
Drew, however, is prepared (both mentally and physically).
He blocks, avoids, rolls, jumps and redirects the attacks on him,
making his way across.
He is about halfway across when an especially fierce and large statue
comes crashing towards him. Drew, caught a little off guard, quickly
adjusts and manages to jump and spin out of the way.

Suddenly, as he turns and tries to get his breath, two huge, deadly
spears are streaking towards him. Drew blocks the SPEARS with his
arms, misdirecting them into the wall behind him.

They THWOCK into the wall, sticking there.

As he rounds a particularly difficult series of statues, a volley of
ARROWS comes HURTLING towards him. Drew blocks some, avoids others,
and catches one in each hand. He throws them down and continues on.

He goes past the few remaining statues, and is out of the Wooden Man
Chamber. All that is left is to walk down a little hallway and out
the door.

Drew looks behind him, then starts to walk. He goes cautiously,
expecting a trap or a trick.

Nothing happens.

He gets to the door and looks for a handle on the door. He spots a
handhold near the top of the door, and pulls it with his hand.

Immediately, his hands is locked in and a panel in the ceiling DROPS
right onto his arm, forcing it down. Drew fights back with his
muscles, the veins popping out in his arms and neck.
Behind him, a statue has started coming towards him, spinning like a
dervish. Its fists and legs are extended, and they are deadly.
The panel drops lower and lower.
FLASHBACK TO UNBENDABLE ARM SEQUENCE

ANGLE ON DREW
As he relaxes his face, and forcibly relaxes his arm and entire body,
letting his inner energy take over.
ANGLE ON PANEL

As it slows with a GRINDING NOISE, then stops.

ANGLE ON DREW
Holding up the heavy stone panel with his arm, his face and body
completely relaxed.
The panel goes back up into the ceiling, and the door opens.
The whirling statue slows, and then stops altogether. Drew reaches up
with a hook kick and taps it in the face.
                    DREW (CONT'D)
           Not this time.
Drew quickly walks through the door.

Drew is there each time to embrace them and congratulate them.

EXT. TEMPLE ­ SAME DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF SAN DE AND D.S. STANDING BEFORE THE ASSEMBLED
DISCIPLES.

There are a few missing from their ranks, monks who did not make it
through the chamber, but the majority of them are there. The entire
temple is gathered to watch the ceremony.

San De and D.S. are dressed in elaborate ceremonial robes.

After he goes through some complicated ceremonial movements,
including the waving of smoking incense over them, San De spreads his
hands

                    SAN DE
           You are now Shaolin. We welcome you into our ranks as
           fighting monks...
A roar rises from the assembled monks, and fireworks go off all
around.
ANGLE ON REAR OF COURTYARD

Where a huge red sheet is pulled back to reveal tables laden with
Chinese dishes, wine and other foods.

The party gets going and is soon in full gear.
ANGLE ON DREW, GAO AND LI
As they congratulate themselves, and gorge themselves on the huge

tables of Chinese food.
ANGLE ON THE ENTIRE GROUP
They are enjoying themselves.
This only happens once every couple of years, and the monks are
intent on enjoying themselves.
ANGLE ON SAN DE (DREW'S POV)
Who is walking towards the side of the temple, away from the party.
ANGLE ON DREW
Who sees him leave. He excuses himself from his group.
                                                 CUT TO:
EXT. BAMBOO GROVE ­ SAME EVENING

ANGLE ON SAN DE

Who is walking in the bamboo grove, his hands behind him. Drew walks
up to him and they bow.

                    SAN DE

           Congratulations.

                    DREW

           I wouldn't have made it through without you.

                  (beat)

           You once asked why I came here, why did you let me in?

                    SAN DE

           Do you remember the story you heard about the monk who
           would not leave?
                    DREW

           Yes.
                    SAN DE
           That monk was me.

ANGLE ON DREW
Who digests this. He smiles a little.
                    SAN DE (CONT'D)

           I would like to ask a favor.
                    DREW
           Anything.

                    SAN DE
           Before you leave for American, can you help at an
           international tournament in Beijing? The Shaolin temple
           has an entry, and he will be fighting men from all over
           the world ­ I'd like you to be there.
                    DREW
           No problem.
                 (he smiles)
           Without pause.
                    SAN DE
           Now, a friend would like to see you.
                 (beat)

           ... alone.

From out of the bamboo grove comes Ashema, her hands in front of her
and her head down. She is not sure Drew wants to see her.

Drew looks at her, then back to San De, but he is already gone. They
are alone.

Drew walks to her, takes her chin in his hand and tilts it up to look
at her face. Her eyes are full of love and tenderness, and a little
fear.

Drew kisses that fear away.

EXT. BEIJING HALL ­ DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF HUGE EXHIBITION HALL. THE MARQUEE READS
"INTERNATIONAL WU SHU COMPETITION".

INT. BEIJING HALL ­ SAME DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF HUGE HALL, THE FLOOR OF WHICH IS CROWDED WITH
RINGS.

One large raised ring is in the middle of the floor ­ the place for
the finals.

ANGLE ON SIDE OF THE RING
Where Li, Gao, San De, D.S. and some others are waiting. They are all
in monastic garb.
Drew and Ashema walk up to them, holding hands. Drew is dressed in a
fighting monk's costume as well, and he bows to his fellow monks.
                    DREW

           Are we late?
                    SAN DE

           The fight has not yet started.
                       DREW
           Did you think he would get into the finals?
                       SAN DE
           Who could know? He fights the winner of the Western
           countries, which is why I wanted you here.
                       DREW
           I'll help any way I can.
ANGLE ON THE CROWD
As it parts to let someone through. Drew turns casually to look at
the competitor. Slowly, a figure, followed by a large group of
people, comes clear... it is Trevor!

ANGLE ON DREW

Who is stunned.

ANGLE ON SAN DE

Could he have known?

ANGLE ON TREVOR

Who spots drew standing near the ring. He walks past him, trying to
place his face. Then, he comes back and walks right up to Drew and
slaps him on the back.

                       TREVOR

           Carson! Drew Carson! I can't believe it! I come half way
           around the world, and run into you! I heard you left the
           city, but I didn't know losing to me drove you into being
           a monk!

Drew is dumbstruck, and Trevor takes advantage of it.

                       TREVOR (CONT'D)
                  (to San De)
           He take a vow of silence too? Nice hair, Drew.
                  (he looks at Ashema)
           If he took a vow of chastity too, honey, you see me after
           this fight, 'Kay?
He puts his arm around Ashema and lets his hand slide down onto her
rear end.
                       TREVOR (CONT'D)
           Wish me luck, huh?
He walks off, and Drew, who still hasn't said a word, stares after

him. All of the monks are looking at Drew with questioning looks,
everyone that is except for San De.
ANGLE ON THE RING
As Trevor and the Shaolin entry bow to each other. The fight begins.
It isn't even close. Trevor is better than he ever was. He is
incredible, and he destroys the Shaolin fighter.
Oblivious to the boos and whistles from the crowd, he plays with the
Shaolin fighter, making him look like a real fool.
INTERCUT REACTION SHOTS OF DREW
Who is watching the destruction. Behind his eyes, he is reliving his
humiliation.
ANGLE ON TREVOR

Who finishes the shaolin fighter off with a devestating technique,
and then immediately plays to the crowd, RIGHT IN FRONT OF DREW AND
THE OTHERS.

The referee comes over to Trevor, and raises his fist up in victory.
Trevor tears his arm away and SCREAMS TO THE CROWD:

                    TREVOR (CONT'D)

           I'M NOT DONE!

The crowd, which before was wild and booing, now grows quiet.

                    TREVOR (CONT'D)

           I want HIM!

He points right at Drew.

                    TREVOR (CONT'D)

           I want to face the American who is now a Shaolin monk! I
           want to learn at the hands of a master!

The crowd, who has seen Drew and heard about him for quite a while,
warms to the prospect. They start cheering for the American Shaolin
to face Trevor.

                    TREVOR (CONT'D)
           I want the American Shaolin!
ANGLE ON DREW


Who doesn't know what to do. San De appears and puts a comforting
hand on his shoulder.

ANGLE ON TREVOR
Pointing and yelling for Drew.
ANGLE ON DREW

Who climbs the ropes and goes into the ring. The crowd is going
crazy, eager to see the match. Drew, oblivious to the crowd, walks
over to Trevor.
                     DREW
           I came to the Shaolin Temple because of you, Trevor. You
           humiliated me, and I wanted to make sure it could never
           happen again.
                     TREVOR
           So, let's see what you've learned.
                     DREW
                   (shaking his head)
           I've learned that... there's nothing to prove. Beating
           you is no longer important. It was my ego that had to be
           defeated, not you.

                     TREVOR (CONT'D)

           Bull! You're just chicken!

                     DREW

           The arts should never be about who is best ­ they are too
           important for that.

He bows to Trevor and starts out of the ring.

ANGLE ON CROWD

They don't know what's going on.

ANGLE ON LI, GAO AND OTHERS

They don't know either. They want Drew to fight him.

ANGLE ON SAN DE AND D.S.
Who know what is happening and are proud of Drew, prouder than they
have ever been.
                     TREVOR

           COME BACK HERE! You can't just walk away!
Drew steps out of the ring and walks over to where San De is
standing. They bow, and the pride is shining in San De's eyes.
                     SAN DE

           Do you turn away from him out of fear?
ANGLE ON TREVOR
Who is seething.

                     TREVOR

           I thought the Shaolin monks were warriors, not babies!
           Look at him ­ he is too scared to face me!
ANGLE ON DREW
His face calm.
                    DREW
           No, master. I will not fight for personal glory, or for
           my ego.
                    SAN DE
           You have learned much.
ANGLE ON TREVOR
                    TREVOR

           The Shaolin monks are PUSSIES! Warrior-monks? Ha!

ANGLE ON SAN DE

Who indicates trevor with a inclination of his head.

                    SAN DE

           You did the right thing.

ANGLE ON TREVOR

                    TREVOR

           How about you, baldy? Or you?

He is pointing at Li and Gao and the others, who are itching to climb
into the ring. Gao goes over to San De, and shoots a questioning look
at Drew.

                    GAO

           Master, the American is insulting the Temple, and the
           fighting monks.
                    SAN DE
                  (looking at drew)

           What should be done?
                    GAO (CONT'D)
           Someone should face him in combat. For the tradition of
           the temple.
San De looks at Drew long and hard.
                    SAN DE
           There are some times when a Shaolin must fight, and some
           people who will not learn until they are taught a lesson.

ANGLE ON DREW
Who understands the implication of what he is saying. He starts to
smile slowly.
                      SAN DE (CONT'D)
           It's your call.
Drew nods, then turns to face the ring, where Trevor is still
standing, trying to get someone to fight him.
Drew walks with Gao back to the side of the ring. He turns to Gao and
Li and together they high-five.
                      DREW
           For the temple...
Drew climbs into the ring.

The crowd is going crazy. Trevor has a predator's grin on his face as
he sits down in his corner to get ready to start the match.
Immediately, his contingent of people start to work on him ­ massage,
drinks, etc.

ANGLE ON DREW

Who sits alone in the other corner.

ANGLE ON LI AND GAO

Who see the difference. Immediately, they mobilize the other monks.

ANGLE ON GAO

Who pulls a drink from one of the men in the crowd, and rushes up to
give it to Drew.

ANGLE ON DREW'S CORNER

As it is flooded with monks. Some of them are massaging Drew
(painfully), others are stretching his legs out, others waving towels
to bring air to him, etc.

The referee signals for the fighters to come to the center. They do,
and he motions for them to bow to each other.

                      TREVOR
           Remember last time, punk?
                      DREW
           Nothing exists but the moment, and...
                 (beat)

           ... I'm going to enjoy it.
They back up, and the fight begins.
Trevor attacks hard, but Drew avoids easily, using all soft gong fu.

He continues to attack, throwing flashy technique after flashy
technique, but he can't touch Drew.
                      TREVOR
           Stay still, dammit! Stand and fight!
And he dances out of the way. Trevor is getting more and more angry.
Soon, Drew tires of this game and decides to end this    quickly. He
goes after Trevor, and it is immediately obvious that    Trevor is
completely outclassed. Drew scores on Trevor at will,    and soon has
Trevor totally confused and helpless with a mixture of    high kicks,
takedowns, flips and punches.
Trevor drops to one knee, his hands down at his side, note even
bothering to defend himself.
Drew grabs Trevor by the front of his uniform and pulls back his
right hand in a fist. He is going to put him out with a good old-
fashioned roundhouse punch.

ANGLE ON LI AND GAO

Yelling for the knock out blow.

ANGLE ON D.S. AND SAN DE

Worried about this latest development.

Instead, however, Drew smiles and lifts Trevor up and shakes his
hand, putting an arm around him to steady him in front of the crowd.

Trevor looks into Drew's face, wondering why Drew would do such a
thing. When he sees Drew's friendly face, he knows.

To teach him a lesson.

Trevor smiles and holds up Drew's hand as the champion.

The crowd goes crazy.

ANGLE ON LI AND GAO

Who also get the message.
ANGLE ON SAN DE AND D.S.
Who knew the message all along.

WIDE ANGLE OF ENTIRE RING
Drew and Trevor standing together in the center. The monks on the
side climb into the ring to celebrate with Drew.
EXT. GREAT WALL ­ MORNING
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW STANDING ON THE GREAT WALL, THE SUNSET OVER
HIS SHOULDER.

He is doing the beginning of a Shaolin form. When he finishes the
salute, a figure comes toward him.

It is San De, and he has something in his hands.
Drew bows to San De, and San De holds THE GOLDEN SASH out to him.
Drew takes it and San De bows to him. Drew can't stand it anymore,
and rushes up to San De. He gives him a hug.
ANGLE ON SAN DE
Who is not used to shows of affection. He is lost for a moment, then
his face softens and he returns Drew's embrace.
They break and bow again, and San De moves off. Drew stands there
holding the Golden Sash, the rising sun of the first day of the rest
of his life shining in the b.g.
ANGLE ON ASHEMA
Who comes up to Drew, taking his arm and walks with him along the
Great Wall.

  FADE OUT

THE END
