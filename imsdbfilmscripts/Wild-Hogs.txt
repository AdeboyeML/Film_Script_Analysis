          INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

          ANGLE ON: BILLY MATTHEWS, 8, ravenously eating a plate
          of hashbrowns, runny fried eggs and syrupy waffles.

          WOMAN'S VOICE (O.C.)
          Doug?...
          We see DOUG MATTHEWS, 40's, sitting across the table,
          staring at his son, Billy. Doug is handsome in that
          honest, sincere way. A guy you would call to help you
          move a couch. He watches Billy scoop up his hashbrowns
          with a frosted pop-tart. Billy catches his Dad's look
          and grins with his mouth full. Doug smiles back, then
          looks down at his own plate. He has scrambled egg whites
          and sliced tomatoes. His smile fades away.

          WOMAN'S VOICE (O.C.) (CONT'D)
          Doug?
          Doug snaps out of it and looks up at his wife, KELLY
          MATTHEWS. She's attractive, with a patient smile.

                         KELLY
          I've got some stuff to do for the party
          tomorrow. Can you take Billy to school?

                         DOUG
          What "stuff"? This party isn't going to
          be fancy, is it? Just some friends and a
          wing platter from Costco?

                         KELLY
          It's a our 10th anniversary, Doug. Its
          going to be a nice party with nice food
          and nice music. And wings have carbs, so
          you can't eat them anyway.

                         BILLY

                         (MOUTH FULL)
          I'll eat 'em.
          Doug gives Billy a look.

                         DOUG
          No you won't. Because I'm going to
          scrape the batter off.

                         BILLY
          That doesn't work.

          I went to medical school. You think I
          don't know how carbs work?

                         BILLY
          Dentists go to medical school?
          Doug looks a little insulted.

                         KELLY
          Doug, can you take Billy or not?

                         DOUG
          Yeah, I can take him. There aren't any
          emergencies at the office this morning.

                         KELLY
          You have emergencies?

                         DOUG

                         (INDIGNANT)
          Yes, I have emergencies. That's what my
          pager is for. one beep from that thing,
          and bam. I'm off. Like a cheetah.
          Billy, now pouring lucky charms into a bowl, looks up.

                         BILLY

                         (MOUTH FULL)
          The battery ith gone in that thing. You
          took them out for the TV clicker.
          Doug gives Billy a look.

                         DOUG
          I did do that. I forgot about that. I
          need to get some batteries in there.
          Because dentists do have emergencies. We
          are doctors, you know? We take the same
          oath. The oath of saving lives.
          Doug goes to take some of Billy's discarded Lucky Charms.
          Billy swats his hand away.

                         BILLY

                         (MOUTH FULL)
          Uh uh. Carbth.
          Doug nods, defeated, as Billy hops up and dumps the
          remaining lucky charms in the trash.

          INT. VOLVO - LATER THAT MORNING

          DOUG drives a Volvo station wagon along the streets of
          Cincinnati. BILLY is next to him, in the passenger
          seat, looking bored. Doug notices.

                         DOUG
          You know, I use to race a car like this.
          Put a hemi under the hood... Nobody saw
          me coming.

                         BILLY
          Really?

                         DOUG
          Yup. It could really... smoke some ass.
          Billy raises his eyebrows, impressed. Doug smiles. This
          was a good time to break the "no saying ass" rule.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          Yes, sir. They called it the dragon
          wagon. You're lucky to be in here
          without a helmet, pal. We both are.
          Doug downshifts a gear, and the tame engine roars
          artificially. Billy is impressed.

                         BILLY
          Awesome! Hey, can I jam the radio?

                         DOUG
          Heck yeah, you can jam the radio.
          Doug tussles Billy's hair and smiles.

           SMASH CUT TO:

          EXT. TRAFFIC LIGHT - A FEW MINUTES LATER

          The Volvo pulls up to a red light. Radio Disney blares
          "MICKEY LOVES MAMBO" from the stereo. BILLY bobs his
          head along with the music. DOUG looks out the window
          and sees a mid-twenties guy in a Porsche, staring at him.
          Doug nods hello, then awkwardly faces forward.

          INT. SMALL OFFICE - MORNING


           VOICE ON SPEAKERPHONE
          Bob?...
          BOB LEVENSTEIN, 40s, is working at his computer. Bob is
          good enough looking, but with a gawky wimpishness and
          burdened eyes. He tries to ignore the speakerphone.

          VOICE ON SPEAKERPHONE (CONT'D)
          Bob!?
          Bob cringes at the shrill, female voice.

                         BOB
          Hey, honey.

          VOICE ON SPEAKERPHONE
          You need to come tell Haley she can't go
          to a party tonight.

                         BOB
          (into speaker phone)
          Well, I'm technically at the office right
          now, so...
          The door behind him flings open, and KAREN LEVENSTEIN,
          attractive and harsh-looking, steps in holding a phone.

                         KAREN
          Are you kidding me!? You work in our
          guest bedroom, not an office.

                         BOB
          I know, I was just trying to make this

                         DEADLINE--

                         KAREN
          Yeah, and I have to go to a job that
          actually makes us money, Bob. So, get
          out here and tell Haley she's not going
          anywhere!
          Bob nods obediently and hurries out of the room.

          INT. BOB'S HOUSE / KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER

          Bob enters the kitchen. His five year-old daughter,
          CLAIRE, wearing a dance leotard, walks up to him and
          smiles.

                         EEEEEIIIIIIIIIAAAAAAAAAAAA1
          Bob winces, and looks around for his other daughter.

          SFX: PHONE RINGS
          Bob reaches for it, but his other teenage daughter,
          HALEY, runs in, wearing a denim mini-skirt and Ugg boots.

                         HALEY
          No!! Don't touch that! It's Julien!
          Haley snatches the phone away from Bob.

                         BOB
          Actually, I need to talk to you--

                         HALEY

                         (IGNORING BOB)
          Hey, Julien. Yeah, totally. I'll
          probably just drop by and chill.

                         BOB
          If that's about the party, you--

                         HALEY
          Dad! I'm talking, here. God!
          Haley storms out of the room. Bob goes to say something,
          but CLAIRE enters and looks up at him.

                         CLAIRE

                         (SCREAMING AGAIN)
          Eeeeeeeiiiiiaaaaa!!
          Bob just stares at her, as Karen enters the Kitchen.

                         KAREN
          (yelling above Claire)
          Did you talk to her? Tell me you talked
          to her. God! I have to do everything!
          Just get Claire to ballet. She's late.

          I have a shareholder meeting. And we
          agreed that my career would be the
          priority, and you would work out of the
          house. You might not like it, but my job
          is higher paying. And I don't see you
          complaining about that hundred dollar
          shirt you're wearing.
          Bob looks down at his too-hip dress shirt.

                         BOB
          You bought this shirt for me. I was fine
          with my t-shirts--

          Take it off! You don't want to wear nice
          things, don't. Off!
          Bob sighs and takes the shirt off. Karen snatches it
          from him.

                         KAREN (CONT'D)
          Now take Claire to her ballet class.
          It's starts in five minutes.

          Karen pushes Bob out the door, with Claire skipping
          happily behind him.

          INT. BOB'S CAR - A MOMENT LATER

          Bob sits in the car, SHIRTLESS, next to Claire. He looks
          over at her, and notices a pink hoodie in her lap.

                         BOB
          You going to wear that?

                         CLAIRE
          For five dollars, I'm not.

          A bunch of kids in dance leotards are starting a class.
          Claire comes running into the group, as Bob enters behind
          her, wearing the pink hoodie. It's way too small, and
          doesn't quite cover his belly. He sits with the parents
          and nods awkwardly to them. It's embarrassing.

                         (GETTING ANGRY)
          Woody Stevens!
          We see WOODY STEVENS, 40s, handsome, but with shifty eyes
          and a Michael Keaton hairline, walk through the stylish
          house speaking into a cordless headset.

                         WOODY
          .No, you listen to me. You're not
          going to push me around. We agreed on a
          price, and that's the price I'll pay. If
          you don't like it, walk away... but you
          can kiss your business good bye, because
          that's what happens when you screw with
          Woody Stevens. You go down. Hard.
          As Woody talks, he passes by framed magazine covers of a
          beautiful model, (CLAUDIA) as well as some pictures of
           his wedding day with her, their exotic vacations, and one
           blownup glamour shot of Woody, shirtless, oiled and
          holding a greasy wrench.

          Money's never a problem. You just need
          to honor the correct price. Got it?
          Woody gets his answer, and angrily throws the headset
          down on a stack of moving boxes. He marches to the front
          door and throws it open.

          ANGLE ON: The front yard. A ten-year-old boy is
          standing with a rake, surrounded by leaves. He clicks
          off his cellphone and shrugs.

                         TOBY
          I can't do this many leaves for ten
          bucks! It'll take two hours!

                         WOODY
          Well, you should have thought of that
          before you put the "any yard for ten
          bucks" flyer on the telephone pole.
          You're done on this block, now. And that
          goes for your band fund-raisers, too.
          I'm not buying any candy bars no matter
          what parade you dorks have to get to!
          Woody slams the door closed. Toby kicks at a pile of
          leaves, then starts home.

          ANGLE ON: DUDLEY FRANK (late 30s), an odd-looking, curly-
          haired guy with black plastic glasses that are slightly
          too big for his face. He stares at a computer in front
          of him.

          sadly, then looks over at a cat sitting on the edge of

          DOUG, now in his lab coat, sits at his desk, playing with
          a model of a mouth. The phone rings and Doug answers it.

          Me? Oh, yeah. I've got a mouth right
          here in front of me.
          Doug takes a dental tool and hammers on the plastic
          mouth.

                         KELLY
          Don't they mind you being on the phone?

          Well, it's not attached to a head,
          really. More research.
          Doug hits the mouth too hard and all the teeth fall out.
          He fumbles to stop them from scattering everywhere.

          found a great rate for the Ritz-Carlton
          tomorrow night. I Thought it might be
          romantic. Mom can stay here with Billy.

                         DOUG
          I don't know. Do you think we really
          need to stay at a hotel? I mean, Billy
          has his own room. Why don't we just buy
          new sheets? Like, hotel-colored ones.
          It'll be like the Ritz, but we won't have
          to pay to make phone calls!

          Doug jumps out of his seat and scrambles over his desk
          and out the door.

          INT. DENTAL EXAM ROOM - A SECOND LATER

          Doug flies into an exam room, where a hygienist, DANA, is
          looking into a male patient's mouth.

                         DANA
          Doctor Matthews. Finally. Take a look
          at this.
          Doug looks in the man's mouth and nods.

          Absolutely. Thanks, doctor.
          Doug nods. He looks around for something else to do, but
          there's nothing. He moves a dental tool away from the
          edge of a tray, smiles politely and exits.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. DOUG'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - LATER THAT AFTERNOON

          DOUG, looking depressed, pulls into the driveway. He
          looks over and sees BILLY and three of his friends
          shooting baskets. He smiles, gets out of the car and
          struts over.

                         DOUG

                         (TO KIDS)
          Yo! Matthews is open.
          Billy looks up and cringes a little bit, but passes the
          ball to DOUG. Doug dribbles it under his leg and charges
          the basket.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          Taking it into the paint. Who's got the
          D? Whoop, too late, dudes! Booya!
          Doug jumps up to slam the ball, but only hammers it into
          the rim. The rim clangs loudly and the ball goes flying
          backwards. Billy's friends laugh a little. Doug
          notices.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          Well, that's not really my shot. I
          usually hit from downtown, you know?
          Doug grabs the ball out of the bushes and dribbles back
          to the three point line.

          That's where the big games get won. Back
          here from the three--
          Doug swivels, jumps up and releases the ball. It heads
          towards the basket, then falls down five feet before it.
          It looks more like a pass than a shot. Billy hangs his
          head, humiliated.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          That was a pass, dudes!
          It wasn't.
          Doug nods with false confidence to the kids, stands there
          awkwardly for a moment, then quietly heads inside.

          INT. DOUG'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER

          DOUG enters and finds KELLY. She smiles and kisses him.

                         KELLY
          Hey, honey. Snack?
          Kelly hands Doug a sandwich bag of celery. He looks over
          to the table, where Kelly has laid out Ritz crackers
          covered in cheez whiz, for the kids. Doug puts the bag
          of celery down.

                         DOUG
          I'm okay. I think I'm just going to go
          meet the guys for a beer.

          chaps, boots, gloves, a black "half-helmet," etc. For
          the first time, we see a genuine smile come over Doug's
          face.

          idles out of the garage on a gleaming, chromed-out Harley
          Davidson Fatboy. He looks around the neighborhood
          cockily, smiles, then kicks the bike into gear and rides
          into the street. The camera rotates around him and comes
          to rest on the back of his jacket, where we see a large
          patch that reads "Wild Hogs." The camera ZOOMS IN ON

          about him, etc. He just tip-toes to the hall closet and
          opens the door. We don't see what's in it, but see Bob
          smile the same way Doug did, and...

          EXT. BOB'S DRIVEWAY - A MINUTE LATER

          BOB, in leather biker gear, rolls out of his garage on
          another shimmering Harley Davidson. He looks around
          through his mirrored aviator sunglasses like a complete
          bad ass. He looks down the street and spots DOUG, riding
          towards him. Bob rides down the driveway and joins
          alongside Doug. They nod silently to each other and tap
          fists like the toughest guys in the world. We see Bob is
          also wearing a "Wild Hogs" jacket.

          Anniversary Edition.
          A MINUTE LATER, Woody pulls onto the street on his
          Harley. DOUG and BOB turn the corner and nod to him.
          Woody nods back, revs his engine, and joins alongside
          them.

          EXT. DUDLEY'S COMPUTER-CLUTTERED GARAGE - SAME TIME

          We see a garage crowded with disassembled Apple
          computers, printers, and a Harley Davidson Sportster.
          Out walks DUDLEY, who's biker outfit doesn't quite mesh
          with his thick-lensed eyeglasses.
          Dudley cockily pulls on a "Wild Hogs" jacket, kick starts
          the motorcycle, presses a button to open the garage door,
          and rides the motorcycle out. However, as he gets
          halfway out of the garage, the garage door catches on
          something, and snaps back down. It clotheslines Dudley
          off the bike, which rolls down the driveway and into some
          garbage cans. Dudley lays in the driveway, staring up at
          the sky with a pained look on his face.

          DOUG, BOB and WOODY ride towards Dudley's house, but find
          DUDLEY sitting in his driveway with his arms around his
          knees. He shrugs and motions to his motorcycle - Which
          he has stood back up, but has a bent wheel and smashed
          headlight. Doug and Bob take in the situation and then
          look at Woody. Woody rolls his eyes...

          DOUG, BOB and WOODY ride along. We see DUDLEY is riding
          bitch on Woody's bike, and Woody doesn't seem thrilled
          about it. The camera pans around and we see they are all

          as they park the bikes among a crowd of other bikers.
          Dudley climbs off the back of Woody's bike and pats him
          on the shoulder.

          The guys are sitting at a worn table. The place is
          crowded with curiously gentle-looking bikers. Woody
          looks around the bar with a smirk.

                         WOODY
          Man, I wish we could find a place that
          wasn't so freaking lame.

                         BOB
          What are you talking about? This place
          is cool. We're with other bikers.

          Suddenly, a large, bald biker comes up and slams a beer
          down on their table.

          cracks a smile.

                         DOUG
          Hey, Paul.
          PAUL laughs at his joke.

                         PAUL
          Hey, guys... Woody, your tax return is
          almost done, but I want to talk to you
          next week about incorporating. A lot of

          Paul exits. Woody shakes his head.

          Daytona with these posers?

                         DOUG
          Because it's Bike Week. That's our

          year. Just us, like it was in college.
          Forget these guys. Forget Daytona beach.
          Bike Week is just corporate white guys
          playing dress up. This bar is, too. And
          we didn't get into this to play dress up -
          we got in this to live. "Be cool and
          Ride free." That's the Wild Hog creed.

          No. That's the best part. We don't do
          some planned out trip. We follow the
          open road. U.S. 50. The backbone of
          America. We take a week and go all the
          way to San Francisco. Think about it,
          guys. Camping out, stopping wherever we
          want, whenever we want... Just freedom.
          When was the last time we had that?

          on a motorcycle - with the words "Born to Be Wild!

          several guests dish steaming pasta and cream sauce out of

          You're not the same, Doug. The old Doug
          wouldn't have made fun of Fred Milton for
          dancing, because he would have been out
          there dancing himself. With me.

          I'm saying you have changed. And
          frankly, i don't like it. I like you the
          way you were. I liked it when you
          weren't afraid of looking stupid. I
          liked it when we laughed. I liked it
          when we danced.

                         DOUG
          Hey, I'll dance! It's just this music is
          lame. People like me need a fresh beat!
          Doug walks over to the stereo and changes the station.
          "Cand Sho " h y-50 Cent starts playing. Doug nods along
          with the beat, as the guests all now stare at him.

           Doug tries to confidently sing along, but struggles 
           awkwardly, as he's obviously never heard the song before.

           wanted? I'm dancing!
           Doug starts grinding and shimmying to the beat. Kelly 
          grits her teeth.

           Doug makes another spastic dance move, then suddenly 
          grimaces and grabs his chest.

          Doug staggers across the carpet as people run to help

          Oh, really? Great. Then, I can say this
          a lot easier. You had a hypertensive
          myocardial seizure.
          Doug nods confidently, then, after a moment:

                         KELLY (CONT'D) 
          Doug, Let me ask you a question. When
          was the last time you sang a Bon Jovi
          song?

                         DOUG
          What?

                         KELLY
          You used to sing Bon Jovi songs at the
          top of your lungs. Like you didn't care
          who heard you, or how dopey it sounded.

                          
          Then one day, you just stopped. That's

                          
          how it's been with everything. Romance,
          sense of humor, the way you used to give
          me that cocky little wink when you took

                          
          off your shirt... It's all faded away,

                          
          leaving just a shell of what you used to

                          
          be. Why? Why no more Bon Jovi songs?

                         DOUG
          I don't know. There's just a lot
          weighing me down these days, you know?

                         KELLY
          Like what? You have a great career, a

                          
          perfect family. Money is fine. The only

          Doug stops himself, as it dawns on him. You can see the
          horror of realization creep across his face. He looks at
          Kelly, wide-eyed.

          Doug takes this in, and smiles at her. She's a good
          wife, and he knows it. Suddenly, BOB enters the room.

          EXT. STREET - THE NEXT WEEK

          DOUG is riding his Harley, which is loaded with gear
          (sleeping bag, spare gas tank, saddle bags). He
          approaches a freeway entrance ramp, where WOODY and
          DUDLEY and BOB are waiting on their bikes, next to an
          entrance ramp sign that reads: U.S. Highway 50. The guys
          all tap fists, then notice Dudley is grinning ear to ear.

                         WOODY

                         (TO DUDLEY)

          I'm a biker, dude! I got a tat!
          Dudley yanks his jacket down to his elbows and we see he
          is wearing a sleeveless shirt underneath. On his bicep
          is a tattoo of the Macintosh Apple. The guys nod, trying
          to look impressed.

                         DOUG
          Wow. That's...

          going to do? It's in my skin, bitch!
          Dudley laughs and pulls on his jacket, as Woody ties a
          bandana skull-cap on his head. The guys look at Woody.

                         WOODY
          Look, the only rule on this trip is to
          have no plan. We're riding to San
          Francisco, and nothing else is planned.
          Just riding free.

                         DOUG
          Well, if we're going to make it in five
          days, we'll should probably get to
          Illinois by tonight.

                         BOB
          Yeah, the way I mapped it out - we should
          be a hundred miles past St. Louis by
          sundown.

                         WOODY
          What? No. No plan. It's the open road.
          Who knows where we'll be.

                         DOUG
          I do. I have this little GPS system.
          Doug shows them a handheld GPS system. Woody grabs it
          and throws it into a storm drain.

          You don't need GPS to discover America.
          We just need the wind, our bikes, and
          freedom. And if we have an emergency, I

          Easy Rider moment. The camera ROTATES AROUND and PULLS
          OVERHEAD. It's beautiful country and the guys are in
          heaven. Dudley wears a clunky helmet from the eighties,

          mirrored sunglasses and gives them a badass nod. The
          kids are amazed. Bob looks to Doug. Doug grins. They
          love this. Bob gives a signal to the other guys and guns
          his engine. The others nod, gun their engines and speed
          away from the station wagon. The kids watch with their

          against the window, staring at the drenched bikers. Bob
          looks over and tries to give them another cocky nod - but

          lounge by a fire - with a tent set up behind them. Doug
          is roasting marshmallows and Bob is straining to blow up
          an air mattress.

          Yes. Go bury it.

          in the earth. I'll find a trash bin

          mattress, like four sardines. Doug opens his eyes to see
          a large figure standing at the foot of the air mattress.
          It's a stern-looking highway patrolman.

                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
          You guys all right?

                         DOUG
          Yeah. Yeah, just on a road trip.

                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
          All right. Just making sure.

                         (BEAT)
          Looks pretty comfortable, actually.
          We see the highway patrolman has started rubbing his
          thigh. Doug quickly jumps up, waking the others.

                         DOUG
          Okay, well... Thanks for stopping. Have
          a nice day, officer.
          The highway patrolman laughs.

                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
          All right, I get it.

                         (WINKS)
          Five's a crowd.
          Doug is mortified. The officer looks them over for a
          moment.

          HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (CONT'D)
          You guys are lucky to have each other.

          Damn lucky.

          That's what I always say.
          Dudley gets up and puts his arm around Doug. We see he's
          wearing a saggy pair of briefs and nothing else.

                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
          Well... Have a good one.
          The patrolman walks off. Dudley looks at Doug and grins.

                         DUDLEY
          Morning.

                         DOUG
          Please put your pants on.

          EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - LATER THAT AFTERNOON

          The guys cruise through the rolling prairies of Missouri.
          It's another beautiful day. They ride in formation,
          until Woody's bandana doo-rag blows off. Woody goes back
          to get it. The other guys stop and wait for him to
          return.

          EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - LATER

          The guys are still riding - but now the heat of the
          Missouri plains is taking it's toll. They look boiling,
          and have sweated through their clothes. Bob takes a
          drink of water from a bottle of water, then pours the
          water over his head. He breathes a sigh of relief, until
          he hears an angry yell behind him. He looks back and
          sees Woody is now drenched from the water. Bob smiles
          sheepishly as Woody burns.

          EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - LATER THAT DAY

          The guys ride through the forested Ozark uplands, looking
          even hotter than before. Doug spots a waterfall pouring
          into a crystal clear spring, and points to it. The guys
          nod in agreement.

          EXT. BLANCHARD SPRINGS, OZARK NATIONAL FOREST - LATER

          DOUG, WOODY, and DUDLEY wade into the spring water in
          their boxers. You can see on their faces that it's like
          dipping into heaven. After a moment, BOB walks up.

                         BOB
          Thanks for waiting for me, jerks.
          The guys look up to see that Bob is naked. He smiles and
          cannonballs into the water.

                         BOB (CONT'D)
          Whhheew: Yeah! That's c-c-cold:
          He sees DOUG, WOODY and DUDLEY are just staring at him.

                         BOB (CONT'D)
          What?

                         WOODY
          Why are you naked?

                         BOB
          We're swimming. You guys kept on your
          skivies?

                         DOUG
          Skivies? What are you, a Newsie?

                         DUDLEY
          I kept mine on because I didn't want
          everyone to see my crank.

                         WOODY

                         (TO BOB)
          Yeah. That, and being naked with a bunch
          of guys is gay. What's wrong with you?

                         BOB
          I don't know. We took showers and stuff
          together in college. I thought this was
          kind of... you know, the same.

                         DOUG
          I guess I get that.

                         (THINKS)
          I mean, we would have been naked in
          college. Why are we... Oh, man. It's
          true. We are tamed. We're old guys.

          No, we're not. Don't say that.
          Doug wiggles his boxers off and holds them in the air.

                         DOUG
          I will find old Doug!
          Doug smiles and throws his shorts on the shore. Dudley
          smiles, takes off his briefs and holds them up.

                         DUDLEY
          I will... Do what Doug does!
          Dudley throws the briefs to shore. They all look at
          Woody. He rolls his eyes and takes off his boxers.

                         WOODY
          I will be naked with my gay friends, and
          if they look at my jock, I will kill
          them.
          Woody throws the boxers to shore. The guys all look at
          each other and smile. It's a nice moment.
          Until a family approaches.
          Doug looks at the other guys, wide-eyed, as a family with
          three young kids walks up with a picnic basket. The
          young kids run and jump into the water. The Dad of the
          family laughs and shakes his head.

                         FAMILY DAD
          Hope you guys don't mind a little
          company. The mini-van was getting a

                         LITTLE--
          The Dad stops talking as he sees into the water... He
          realizes, then looks at his kids, concerned.

                         DOUG
          Um... Well, we're just taking a dip. I

                         UH--

                         WOODY
          There's a shallower spring up the path.
          The kids might like that even more...
          The Mom lays down a blanket and turns to the guys. The
          Dad is still staring, not sure what to do.

          The Mom sees a glimmer of something through the water,
          and realizes. She suddenly looks very uncomfortable.

          Janey, Kyle, Holland. Out of the water.

          The kids climb out of the water and the parents hurry off
          with them down the path. After a moment of awkward
          silence, Doug looks at the guys.

                         DOUG
          We should go.

                         BOB

          stare, horrified, as he pops up and smiles at them.

          EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - LATE THAT AFTERNOON

          The guys are back on their bikes, cruising along the
          wheat fields of Kansas. They're looking tired once
          again, but suddenly Doug smiles...
          On the horizon, a bar comes into view. Out front are
          several rows of Harley Davidsons. Doug points it out to
          the guys and they all smile. It's like an oasis.
          The pull into the parking lot and climb off their bikes.
          Bob immediately falls to the ground.

                         BOB
          Dammit! Leg's asleep.
          The guys go to help Bob up, as Dudley gets off his bike
          and falls to the ground.

                         DUDLEY
          Me, too.

                         DOUG
          You guys have to shift every once in
          awhile. Blood has to circulate.
          A MOMENT LATER. Dudley and Bob are up and wiggling their
          sleeping limbs, as Woody looks up at the bar.

                         WOODY
          Now this is the best part of any road
          trip. Seeing our brothers on wheels.
          Look at this place. America!
          The guys look at it and nod. It is a cool looking shack
          of a bar. Doug admires the row of motorcycles out front.

                         DOUG
          Look at these bikes. They're all
          classics.

                         BOB
          Oh, man. Check it out. A 1951 Panhead.
          You know how rare this thing is?
          The guys all crowd around the bike.

                         DOUG
          Yeah, but why didn't he customize it?
          You have a 51 panhead and you don't
          chrome out the exhaust? Or airbrush an
          eagle on the gas tank? What a waste.

          in hick-land. We'll leave 'em a catalog.
          The guys push open the door and step into the bar.

          INT. BIKER BAR - CONTINUOUS

          The bar is full of bikers, but not the kind we saw
          before. These guys are greasy, tattooed and menacing.
          We see their jackets say "Hells Angels." The bikers turn
          and stare at WOODY, DOUG, BOB and DUDLEY.

          Hells Angels, huh? You guys are legends.
          I'm surprised we've never seen you in
          Daytona.
          The bikers kind of chuckle to themselves. The leader of
          the gang, JACK, steps forward. He's in his late 40's -
          and looks like he could break you into bite size pieces.

                         JACK
          Yeah, how do we keep missing that?
          The bikers all laugh. Doug and the guys join in, though
          they don't quite get what's so funny.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          So you re "Wild Hogs," huh? That's your

          So it's like a little hobby for you guys?

          Doug smiles, but is now sensing the hostility. He looks
          back for the exit.

          Dudley whips his jacket off and hands it to Jack, who
          pulls it on his massive frame. He shows it to the gang,

          Doug, don't worry. Yeah, I'll have a

          mean I'll get all cocky.

          Come on, Dud. Let's go see how you look
          on it.
          Jack smiles and leads Dudley outside. Doug, Bob and
          Woody share an uncertain look.

          Anybody else got that "pre-rape" feeling?

          EXT. BIKER BAR - CONTINUOUS

          Everyone is standing out front. Dudley starts to get on
          the classic motorcycle. Jack stops him.

                         JACK
           Oh, no, no. That's Oilcan's ride. My
          ' 51 panhead is right over there.
          Jack points to a pile of abandoned rusty motorcycles.
          Among it is the junked carcass of a '51 panhead next to
          an old, rusty sidecar. Dudley looks confused.

                         DUDLEY
          That? That's a piece of junk.

                         JACK
          Yup. Your piece of junk.
          Woody, Doug and Bob look at each other. This isn't good.

          joke? Suburban assholes that buy leather
          outfits and think they're bikers. And
          it's a joke I'm damn sick of. So I'm
          keeping your friend's bike, I'm keeping
          this jacket, and you guys are going to
          turn the hell around and go back to
          wherever you came from, because the next
          hundred miles of this highway belongs to
          the Hells Angels.

          Bob makes an audible whimper. Doug elbows him, and tries
          to look brave.

          All right. We respect that this is your
          turf, and we're sorry for bothering you.
          But we can't head back without my
          friend's bike. So clearly we're going to
          have to work something out here.
          Jack looks back at the Hells Angels and nods.

          We see DOUG, BOB and WOODY riding away from the bar,
          looking very glum. The camera PULLS OUT to reveal the
          rusty sidecar is now attached to Woody's bike. DUDLEY
          sits in it looking miserable and cold (having lost his
          jacket and now in his sleeveless shirt).
          The guys get a good distance away from the bar and Woody
          waves for them to stop. They do and Woody looks back to
          the bar.

          right past them.

          back home.

                         WOODY
          We're going to turn back after all these
          miles? Just because some fat bully's
          pushed us around?

                         DOUG BOB
          Yes. Yes.
          Woody shakes his head and looks at Dudley.

          I go wherever you go.

          Good. See? Dudley's got some balls.

                         DUDLEY
          No, my sidecar's just attached to your
          bike. I'd prefer to turn back, but I
          could only roll so far...

          I can't believe you guys. What a bunch
          of pussies. The whole point of this trip
          is to live, man.

                         DOUG
          That's the point, Woody. Our lives
          aren't on this highway. They're back
          home. We have families, jobs, wives...
          or cats... We're not going to piss off a
          biker gang. We're going back.
          Woody takes this in, gritting his teeth in disappointment.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          Come on, Woody. You don't want to take

          Woody looks up at him. Something about this has sparked
          something in Woody's eyes, but he covers it up with a
          calm smile.

                         WOODY
          You're right, I do. But maybe I should
          talk to those guys one more time. I
          mean, I'm an executive at an Investment
          firm. I've made a career out of
          convincing people and these are just
          people. You guys wait here.
          Woody starts up his bike. Doug and Bob look at each
          other and shrug. Dudley hurries out of the sidecar.

                         DUDLEY
          I'll wait here, too. You'll get better
          gas mileage.
          Dudley gets out and falls to the ground.

          Woody shakes his head and starts back to the bar.

          EXT. BIKER BAR - SAME TIME

          Woody rides up to the bar, and looks back to make sure
          he's out of Doug, Bob and Dudley's sight. He sees that
          he is, and kneels next to the line of Hells Angels
          motorcycles. He takes out an army knife, and slices
          through one of the motorcycle's gas line. Gas starts
          leaking out onto the ground and Woody nods.

          Woody goes along to each bike, smiling with a weird
          recklessness as he slices through each gas line.

          WOODY pulls up on his bike, where DOUG, BOB and DUDLEY

          Yup. I tried to be polite. I tried to

          Well, technically we're all dying,
          Dudley. Just very slowly.
          Dudley looks concerned.

          Oh my god, you're right.

                         (REALIZING)
          I'm slowly dying.

                         WOODY
          Anyway, none of that worked. So I laid
          it out for them. I said, "Hey, go ahead
          and assault us. Because we might be not
          be real bikers, but we know real lawyers.
          And the moment you touch us is the moment
          you get your ass sued. Because this is
          the real world - with real laws, and real
          consequences." And they backed down.
          The guys are impressed.

                         DOUG
          You really said that?

                         WOODY
          Yup. And I think they'll give us
          Dudley's bike on the way back, so let's
          go. Quick. Before they change their
          mind.
          Woody quickly starts his bike and rides on. The guys
          shrug, impressed, and follow him.
          After a moment, we see them all speed by the bar.

          Jack is playing darts with the other bikers. He goes to
          throw a dart and hears engines roar past the bar outside.

          fly off target and stick into the shoulder of one of the
          bikers, (OILCAN).

          Saddle up, boys. Somebody doesn't listen.
          The guys nod and head outside. Oilcan pulls the dart out
          of his shoulder, and stops by Jack on the way out.

          Try and watch the throws, okay Jack?
          Jack glares at oilcan for a beat, then jabs a dart into

          The Hells Angels roar away from the bar on their
          motorcycles. They get to the end of the driveway, and
          the bikes sputter and choke to a stop.
          ANGLE ON: JACK. He's on his hog, with a cigarette
          dangling out of his mouth. He looks down in confusion at
          the suddenly stalled bike.

          You've gotta be kidding me.
          Suddenly, the cigarette falls out of Jacks mouth, and
          onto the ground. A puddle of gas from the sliced line
          catches on fire.

          flame has reached the parking area and ignited all the
          puddles of gas. They all watch in horror as the fire
          ravenously engulfs the old wooden porch of the bar, then
          the roof ...

          look in his side-view mirror and notice a large, black
          plume of smoke back in the distance. A look of worry
          creeps over his face.

          DOUG, BOB, WOODY and DUDLEY ride along the highway, as

          Come on, Woody. It looks like a neat
          town. And Dudley's got another bag of
          poop to throw away.
          Dudley nods. Woody grits his teeth as they enter the
          town. It's a quiet, one stop-light town - with an old
          fashioned main street and town square. We see a banner
          over the street advertising a block party that night.
          It's a postcard version of small town America.

          INT. MAIN STREET DINER - SAME TIME

          The owner, BUD, is pressed up against the glass -
          watching the motorcycles come down Main street. He
          shakes his head.

                         BUD
          Oh, don't tell me they're here again

          Bud walks back to the bar, past his daughter (and diner
          waitress) MAGGIE, 28, pretty in that cute, small town
          way.

                         MAGGIE
          Just stay calm, Dad. At least it's not
          all of them, this time.

          EXT. MAIN STREET DINER - SAME TIME

          The guys pull up to the diner and we see the local
          pedestrians hustle away. The street is soon deserted,
          but the guys don't notice.
          They go to park their bikes, but there's not enough
          space. There's a police car in the parking spot next to
          them, and the town sheriff, CHARLEY, comes running
          towards it from across the street.

                         CHARLEY
          I'll move it! Hold on, I'll move it!
          Charley jumps into the car and backs it out of its spot.
          The guys look at each other, surprised.

                         DOUG
          Wow. Lucas is a polite town.

                         BOB
          That's how these little towns are. It's
          unspoiled America.

                         WOODY
          It's a shithole. Let's keep moving.
          The guys ignore Woody and enter the diner.

                         WOODY (CONT'D)
          Okay, we'll get it to go, then. We can
          ride and eat if it's wrapped in a
          tortilla.
          Woody gets no response. He looks back down the road,
          uneasily, then follows the guys in.

          INT. MAIN STREET DINER - SAME TIME

          BOB, DOUG, WOODY and DUDLEY enter, with their motorcycle
          boots thunking on the wood floor, announcing to the

          Everyone freezes and the place goes silent. The only
          sound is a single fork dropping onto a plate.
          BUD is pulsing with anger, but he swallows it down.

                         BUD

          to join us this afternoon.

          Maggie smiles. She has a radiant sweetness, even though
          she's scared to death.

          And what would you gentleman like today?
          Doug looks to the next table, where a man is enjoying
          french toast.

          Mmmm. I'll have what he's having.
          Maggie nods obediently and takes the man's plate. She
          slides it in front of Doug.

          confused as she runs to the kitchen in tears. Bob looks
          back to the guys.

          them last time, and I just sat there like
          I always do... Well, not this time!
          (turns to Murdock)
          Listen, you piece of shit. You think you
          can just walk around and bully perfectly
          nice people? You think that's how it
          works? Well, guess what? This is the
          real world. With real laws and real
          consequences. You hear me!?
          Bob swats Murdock's beer out of his hand. It spills all
          over him. Murdock is too filled with rage to speak.

                         BOB (CONT'D)
          Now get out of here! And if that gang of
          inbred assholes needs things explained to
          them again, tell 'em the Wild Hogs will
          be right here in Lucas tonight.
          Woody puts his face into his hands.

                         BOB (CONT'D)
          Now get.
          Murdock just stares daggers at him.

                         BOB (CONT'D)
          Get!
          Bob kicks the stool out from under Murdock. He almost
          falls, but catches himself on a stool. He glares at the
          guys, but he's outnumbered. He grits his teeth and
          storms out the door. Woody winces to himself as he
          watches Murdock go. This isn't good.
          After a moment, BUD comes running out from behind the
          bar.

          CHARLEY, the sheriff from before, stands up from behind a
          countertop in the kitchen.

          I keep the peace here.

          aggression...

                         (GIVES UP)
          Yeah, I was hiding in the kitchen.
          Charley looks at them for a moment, then starts to tear
          up.

                         CHARLEY (CONT'D)
          I'm an embarrassment.
          Charley hurries off to the bathroom. The guys look at

          EXT. MAIN STREET - A FEW MINUTES LATER

          CHARLEY walks through the town square with DOUG, BOB,
          WOODY and DUDLEY. There's a stage and booths set up
          around the park in the center - ready for the block
          party. As the news spreads that the Wild Hogs are
          friendly, the townspeople start to take to the streets
          again.

                         CHARLEY
          Sorry about all the confusion when you
          arrived. Those guys are pretty rough.
          You're the first people to ever stand up
          to them.

                         DOUG
          Well, Woody is the one who really--

                         BOB
          Hey-- we should probably share the
          credit. I mean, I just basically kicked
          that guy's ass. Man! You know how good
          that felt!? Yeah!
          Bob punches a handicapped parking sign, which rattles
          against its post, then falls to the ground. Bob
          immediately looks regretful.

                         DOUG
          Nice. Now the paraplegics can park down
          the block and get more exercise.

                         BOB
          (suddenly meek again)
          Should I fix it? Oh, man. I should.

                         (TO CHARLEY)
          I'm sorry... I didn't mean to--

                         CHARLEY
          Forget about it. We only have one
          cripple and he gets pulled around in a
          wagon. Come on, I want to show you guys
          something.
          Charley leads the guys off.

          INT. POLICE GARAGE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

          Charley flips on the light in a neatly organized police
          garage. In the middle sits a sparkling, unridden Harley
          Davidson police bike.

          Wow. That's fantastic.

                         BOB
          You ride this?

                         CHARLEY
          Oh, no. The Hells Angels would take it
          to pieces if they ever saw me on it. I
          just keep it in here. Polish it and so
          forth. But I'd never let them see it.

                         DOUG
          Those guys are that big of a problem,
          huh?

                         CHARLEY
          Yeah. They ride into town a few times a
          month and get drunk, damage property...
          Basically turn the place upside down.

                         DOUG
          And the police don't do anything?

                         CHARLEY
          Well, It's a small town - and me and the
          Dooble brothers are the only law. And
          they're still pretty green.

                         WOODY
          Can't you call a bigger town or something
          for backup?

                         CHARLEY
          Yeah, I've done that a few times. But
          the gang is always gone by the time they
          get here. We've also tried wearing riot
          gear, which does protect you from being
          hit, but not from being dragged. Also,
          one of the Dooble brothers tried to throw
          tear gas, but the bottle exploded and
          blew off his ear.

                         DUDLEY
          Ech.

                         CHARLEY
          Yeah, he's hard to look at.

          Anyway, we want you guys to stay at our

          Oh, thanks, but we're actually moving on--

          We'd be honored to stay. Thank you.
          Woody's looks at Doug in protest. Doug gives him a stern
          glare.

                         CHARLEY
          And if you're not in a rush to leave in
          the morning-- We've got a great trout
          stream you might want to check out.

                         DUDLEY
          Cool! Let's fish!
          Doug shrugs.

                         DOUG
          Sure. Let's do it.

                         WOODY
          Uh uh. No, I'm putting my foot down,
          here. I still get a vote on what we do,
          you know? And I want my vote.

                         DOUG
          Okay. Of course you get a vote.
          Woody nods and looks at Bob and Dudley. They clearly
          intend to stay.

                         WOODY
          I actually get three votes. Because I
          planned the trip.

                         DOUG
          But you didn't plan the voting system. I
          did. So you only get one. Sorry.
          Doug, Bob and Dudley walk off. Woody fumes.

                         WOODY

          EXT. BIKER BAR - SAME TIME

          MURDOCK has arrived at the bar, which is just a burned
          shack at this point. The Hell's Angels are gathered
          around, watching JACK beat the crap out of a remaining
          wall with a pipe. He finally stops when the wall has
          crumbled.

                         JACK
          Those assholes think they can cross the
          Hells Angels? Do you know how bad
          they've made us all look!?
          The gang nods. They all look pissed.

          Those guys have some balls. Balls I will
          put in my mouth and chew on!!
          The gang looks at Jack with a slight smile. OILCAN
          chuckles.

                         OILCAN
          You're going to put balls in your mouth?
          The gang laughs. Jack realizes what the joke is...

                         JACK
          No! I'm not-- I'm going to put my foot
          up their asses! Both feet! Hell, I'm
          going to stick anything I can in their
          asses, and I'm going to enlov it.
          The guys start laughing again. Jack boils red.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Shut up!! I didn't mean-- Just get on
          your damn bikes! We're riding to Lucas!
          The guys start towards their bikes. Oilcan sidles up
          next to Jack.

                         OILCAN
          Sometimes it helps if you say things in
          your mind first, then say it out loud,
          you know?
          Jack looks at Oilcan for a beat, then bends down, picks a
          dart up out of the ash, and jabs it into his shoulder.

          EXT. MAIN STREET HOTEL - THAT AFTERNOON

          DOUG, BOB, WOODY and DUDLEY exit out of an old fashioned
          hotel next to the diner. They cross to the town square,
          where the block party is in full swing. Townspeople
          mingle around eating corn-on-the-cob and hotdogs. Up on
          the stage, a plump, middle-aged man with a goatee and a
          polo shirt tucked into dockers - sings Justin
          Timberlake's "Rock Your body."

                         PLUMP MAN
          So you grab your girls, And you grab a
          couple more.
          And you all come meet me, in the middle
          of the floor.
          Gonna rock your body! 'Till the break of

                         DAY--
          The man drops to his knees at the edge of stage and
          reaches his hand out to the audience, like the star of a
          boy band; However, it's clearly making the people on the
          dance floor uncomfortable.
          Meanwhile, Doug, Bob, Woody and Dudley walk through the
          square and are instantly greeted, patted on the back and
          thanked by each townsperson they pass. The word is out
          that these guys are heroes. Doug gives a "can you
          believe this?" look to the other guys - who are just as
          thrilled as him. They're eating it up.

                         DOUG

          Dudley turns to Woody and stares at him. Woody looks

          Dudley gets a deflated look and backs off of Woody.

          Dudley walks off towards the beer tent. Woody looks to
          the other guys with a puzzled look.

                         BOB
          It's true. He was unclogging his bathtub
          drain and the cat thought it was a ball
          of yarn.
          Doug and Woody wince.
          ANGLE ON: DUDLEY, at the beer tent. He gets in line,
          and realizes he's behind MAGGIE. She smiles at him.

          vintage Apple 2e. Restored it from

          EXT. TOWN SQUARE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

          DOUG, BOB and WOODY are sitting at a picnic table,
          drinking beer out of plastic cups. They lean back and
          soak up the small town celebration around them. It's a
          great night.

          CHARLEY approaches with his two deputies, EARL DOOBLE and
          BUCK DOOBLE. They are chubby, thirty-year old twins -
          identical in every way, except for the fact that Buck is
          missing an ear on the right side of his head... which the
          skin has scarred back over. It doesn't look good.

                         CHARLEY
          Howdy, guys! Welcome to the block party!
          These are my deputies: Earl and Buck
          Dooble.
          Earl shakes the guys hands.

                         EARL
          I'm Earl and he's Buck. Just remember,
          the brother with the word "ear," in his
          name, has both on his head.

                         (LAUGHS)
          I can only say that because I'm on his
          right side. Which as you can see, is
          blown off.
          Earl laughs again, as BUCK extends his hand - oblivious.

                         BUCK
          I'm Buck and this is Earl. Good luck
          telling us apart!
          Buck laughs and turns to Charley, exposing his missing
          ear to the guys. They draw back a little.

                         BOB
          Well... Still a nice town.

          ANGLE ON: DANCE FLOOR AREA:
          DUDLEY is on the dance floor with MAGGIE. The middle
          aged guy on stage is letting loose with a rendition of
          Usher's "Yeah." Maggie and Dudley dance conservatively
          for a moment, but as the beat gets ahold of Dudley, he
          starts getting into it. He starts spinning around at a
          rapid pace, then drops to his knees, slaps the ground and
          shakes his head to the music.
          Maggie watches curiously as Dudley pulls himself along
          the ground by his elbows - then springs up to his feet
          and starts a move that resembles a sprinkler. Maggie
          grins - actually amused by Dudley's rhythmic passion.

          Charley, Buck and Earl - watching Dudley with a curious
          look.

                         CHARLEY
          Looks like your friend and Maggie are
          hitting it off.

                         DOUG
          Yeah. I think he really likes that girl.

                         CHARLEY
          Well, Maggie's a great woman.

                         EARL
          Yup. Big cans, too. Buck liked her, but
          you know... He's a deformed freak.
          Buck, on Earl's left, stares out at Maggie and Dudley,
          deaf to the conversation.

                         BUCK
          I used to like that girl... but then I
          realized, I can do better.
          The guys look at Buck.

                         CHARLEY
          So, why are you guys taking this road
          trip, anyway?

                         DOUG
          Ahh, just to escape for a bit.

                         WOODY
          Hey, we're not escaping anything, man.
          We're on this trip to live.

                         CHARLEY
          I know what you mean. Sometimes things
          in life can bother you, and sometimes
          nothing in life can bother you. Either
          way, you've got take a break from it.
          Happiness is somewhere between boredom
          and stress.
          Doug is surprised at Charley's insight. So is Woody.

                         WOODY
          Exactly. Which is why we need to keep
          riding until we figure out where that
          happiness is. You don't get old Doug

          Yeah. Apparently I've lost him. I don't
          sing Bon Jovi anymore.

                         WOODY
          You did lose him, Doug. You know why?
          You're housebroken. You're too
          comfortable. You've got to snap out of
          it!
          Doug nods halfheartedly. He knows woody might be right.

                         (TO DOUG)
          Woody's got a point, there. Comfortable
          can be a bad thing. You have to wake up
          and slap the bull once in a while.

                         WOODY
          Right! Slap the bull!
          (then, to Charley)
          What?

                         CHARLEY
          Slapping the bull is kind of the local
          test of manhood. It's a way to prove you
          aren't controlled by fear. We've all
          done it.

                         EARL
          Yup. Even torn-open head, here.
          He nods at Buck, on his left.

                         BUCK
          You know, I slapped the bull once.
          Woody smiles slyly. Doug looks concerned.

                         WOODY
          We're slapping the bull.

                         DOUG
          I don't think we need to. I mean, we can
          have our own test of manhood. Let's see
          how many ears of corn we can eat or
          something. I'll start.
          Doug grabs an ear of corn and takes a bite, but Woody
          just grins with that reckless look in his eyes.

          EXT. COW PASTURE - THAT EVENING

          DOUG, BOB, WOODY, CHARLEY, BUCK and EARL approach a fence
          surrounding a pasture. Charley smiles.

          Here we are. The Lucas test of manhood.
          Slap the bull.
          Charley gestures to a lone bull grazing in the pasture.
          He's a frighteningly large bull with enormous horns.

                         WOODY
          Wow. So it's literally slapping a bull?

                         EARL
          Yup. Right on the ass. Then high-tail
          it out of there, because he can kill ya.

                         DOUG
          Wow. Um... Woody? This was your idea,
          so... go ahead.
          Woody nods.

                         WOODY
          All right. I'm going in.

          Hell yeah. I'm gonna slap the shit out
          of that bull. Like, pimp-style.
          The guys look at him, surprised and somewhat impressed.
          Woody takes a breath and climbs over the fence. He
          approaches the Bull very quietly and cautiously. He gets
          within three feet of it, leans in and slaps the Bull hard
          on the ass.
          The bull makes an annoyed sound and turns around, but
          Woody is already hightailing it back to the fence, with
          an exhilarated look on his face.

          Yes! Wow! That felt so good. I just

          pissed of a bull!
          (back to Bull)

          Woody high fives all the guys.

          All right. I'm in. I'm slapping that
          bull.
          The guys cheer as Doug climbs over the fence and starts
          heading towards the Bull. The group all leans on the
          fence, watching.

          Yeah, and we've never seen it done twice
          in a row. It'll be interesting to see
          how the bull takes being slapped now that
          he's alert.

                         WOODY / BOB
          Alert?
          Woody and Bob look at each other, then to the Bull -
          which Doug is about to slap.

                         WOODY
          Doug, wait!

          Wheeeeew!! Yeah!
          Doug runs across the field, but the Bull - now fully
          alert - swivels with magnificent agility and breaks into
          an angry charge towards Doug.
          The guys all watch in horror as the Bull quickly gains on
          Doug. Doug sees the fear on the guys faces and looks
          back over his shoulder. His smile quickly turns to
          terror.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          Ahhhhhhhh!
          It's too late. The Bull catches Doug and bucks him into
          the air. Doug flies ten feet and comes crashing down on
          the muddy grass. The Bull takes a few steps back and
          starts lining up another charge at him.

                         WOODY
          Oh, no you don't!
          Woody jumps over the fence and runs into the field.

          Heeeeey! Hey you! Come get me, Bull!
          The Bull notices Woody and starts to Charge him.

                         WOODY (CONT'D)
          Run, Doug! Go!
          Doug climbs to his feet and sees the bull charging Woody.
          Woody realizes he's in trouble and starts to run again.
          The bull quickly catches him and rams him into the air.
          Woody lands hard, with a grunt.
          The bull turns back to charge at Woody again, and Bob
          jumps over the fence.

          Hey! Leave him alone! You want some of
          this!? Come get this!
          Bob sprints out into the field. The bull snorts and
          starts towards him. The Bull closes on Bob quick, but at
          the last moment Bob dives of the way. The bull goes
          flying past him.

          Doug and Woody look impressed as Bob helps them hurry
          towards the fence. Charley and Buck hold a gate open for
          them as the Bull makes a turn and lines the group up, but
          they've already made it to the gate. They go through and
          Charley shuts it behind them. They lean back on the
          fence, trying to gather their bearings, except Bob - who
          is thrilled.

                         BOB (CONT'D)
          Did you see me? I dodged him! I dodged
          that stupid cow! How cool am--
          Suddenly, the Bull charges into the fence, which Bob's
          butt is sticking through. Bob goes flying and lands face
          down in the dirt. He scrambles back up, furious.

                         BOB (CONT'D)
          You son of a bitch! You want to keep it
          going!? You want to take cheap shots!?
          Come on!
          Bob tries to climb back into the pasture, but the guys
          restrain him.

          Doug and Woody hold on to Bob until he calms down. Doug
          and Woody start to laugh. Bob cools off for another
          moment, then starts laughing as well.

                         WOODY
          No this is living!

          The group high fives each other in congratulations, and
          starts away: Bruised, muddy and laughing.
          ANGLE ON: THE BULL. He pushes on the gate that Charley
          was holding open. The gate swings open.
          ANGLE ON: WOODY, BOB and DOUG. They walk with Charley
          and the Dooble brothers, laughing and carrying on.

          Bob does an impression of how he dodged it and goes for
          some more high fives - but suddenly, the bull charges
          into frame and nails him. As Bob goes flying; we:

          The block party is winding down. Dudley is sitting by
          himself at a picnic table, in post-Maggie bliss.
          DOUG, WOODY and BOB approach, dirty and beaten from the
          bull - but, carrying on happily.

          Man, did you see the look on Bob's face
          when he got up? Didn't dodge him that
          time!
          Woody and Doug laugh. Bob looks pissed.

                         BOB
          I'm going to go back there with a rifle
          tomorrow and shoot one of his legs off.

          Doug and Woody laugh again. Bob just steams. They spot
          DUDLEY, and head over to him.

          Come on. Let's go back to the hotel.
          We've got to get up early to do some
          fishing.
          The guys start walking towards the Main Street hotel.

                         WOODY
          Okay, fine. But after fishing - we hit

          The guys continue with enthusiastic cheers as we hear the
          off-screen rumble of engines. Doug looks down the street
          and sees: THE HELLS ANGELS. All forty of them are
          riding into town - and the guys will be in their view any
          second. Woody is frozen with fear.

                         DOUG
          Are you kidding me? Woody, you're going
          to have to talk to these guys again. Get

          DOUG, BOB and DUDLEY look confused. Woody looks around
          desperately for somewhere to hide - but the Hells Angels
          are too close. There's no time. Woody spots a port-o-
          potty from the block party and starts corralling Doug,
          Bob and Dudley into it.

          Hells Angels cruise by them.

          The Hells Angels park their bikes. We see all the
          townspeople have stopped enjoying themselves, and just
          stand there, scared. Jack gets off his bike and looks
          around.

          too much for the port-o-potty...

          The port-o-potty tips over. All the Hells Angels turn
          and look as it crashes over on it's side. They continue
          to stare at it curiously.

          The guys, now on their side, freeze as they see through
          the vent that the Hells Angels are staring at them. It's
          a very tense moment as they wait to see if they've been
          discovered. After a moment, we hear a "glup, glup,
          glup," And the guys smell something curious.

          Jack starts his bike and roars out of the town. The
          others follow him, gunning their bikes and leaving skid
          marks and smoke in their trail. A kid yells at the Hells
          Angels as they ride out of sight.

          Suddenly, the door pops open on the port-o-potty and the
          WILD HOGS topple out of it in a heap. We see they're
          soaked in blue port-o-potty juice.

          enough money to get my lawn raked
          anymore.

          That's why I couldn't go back. This
          isn't a vacation for me, it's the only
          thing I have left. There's nothing more
          in my life but you guys. So, I lied
          about the Hells Angels. I lied because I
          wanted to have one thing in my life that
          wasn't a complete failure. A real trip
          with my best friends... You're all I
          got. I'm sorry.
          Woody lowers his head. The guys take this in for a
          minute. Woody looks at them, waiting for their sympathy.

          This trip is just you running from your

          Woody's puppy-dog face dissolves.

          Fine! I see how important I am to you
          guys. That's just fine. I just thought
          being a "Wild Hog" meant something!
          Woody takes off his "Wild Hogs" jacket and throws it at
          their feet. He hops out of the fountain and storms off
          down the street.

          Doug, Bob and Dudley look at each other. After a moment,
          they look over to the sidewalk and see:
          ALL THE TOWNSPEOPLE, staring at them in disappointed
          silence. Slowly, the townspeople turn and quietly head
          back to their homes. Doug, Bob and Dudley lower their
          heads in disgrace. So much for being heroes.

          DOUG stands in the darkened police station with DUDLEY,

          with DOUG.

          The Hells Angels have returned, and set up shop in the
          diner, but are also flowing out onto the street. Jack
          stumbles into the middle of the road, with a bottle of
          tequila in his hand.

          Alright, Wild Hogs. We know you're in

          checked out of the hotel. We're a little

          Crap. I was thinking of that for us.

          You guys just stay in the station
          tonight. No one needs to go out there
          and be a hero and end up getting hurt.

          Wow. So... You're not going out there?

          Well, you're the cop. Why don't you go
          out there?
          Charley is visibly hurt. His lip starts to tremble.

          shakes his head and looks at Doug.

          You know, people have feelings. Sure, I
          make comments about "chum face," here.
          But that's because every time I look at
          him I see parts of his brain. But nobody
          has the right to hurt Charley like that.
          He has both sides of his head.
          Earl storms off, leaving BUCK, who was standing on his
          left and hasn't heard or seen any of them leave. He
          stands there, looking at Doug and Dudley.

          Doug wakes up on a cot in an open jail cell. He walks
          out of the cell, and over to the window.
          ANGLE ON: The Main Street Diner: The Hells Angels bikes
          are still parked outside, and the bikers appear to be
          passed out in various booths, chairs, and the street out
          front.
          BACK ON: The police station. Dudley and Bob approach
          the window.

                         DOUG
          They're still out there. Passed out.

          Well, I talked to Karen. She going to
          fly out here, rent a mini-van, and pick
          us up. We'll just ship the bikes back
          later.

                         DOUG
          Bob, we can't leave. They'll just stay
          here and keep terrorizing this town.

                         BOB
          So what? They can call the National
          guard or something.

                         DOUG
          For what? To be stationed here

          Bob looks uncomfortable at this thought.

          Doug walks through the park, looking depressed. He
          passes through a small playground, and has a seat on a
          bench. He watches all the children play, and his eyes
          fall on four young boys happily riding their bicycles
          together. They have cards in their spokes, making engine

          when you become a husband and a Dad, you
          realize adventure is risk, and a family

          You're right. That's why I stopped
          singing Bon Jovi. Life used to be a
          risk. That was old Doug. And now it's
          gone. I've taken away all the risk.

                         DOUG
          Well, what's the point of being in a
          motorcycle gang if we can't ourselves in
          a little trouble?
          Woody looks back at him. Doug smiles a little bit.

          It'll be okay, man.
          Woody smiles a little as well.

          They won't kill us, right? Just a...
          really bad beating.

          Yeah. We won't die. I don't think.

          No way. And how much could a punch
          really hurt? Not much, probably.

                         WOODY
          Let's go find the Bob and Dudley.
          Doug looks around the canoe for a paddle.

                         DOUG
          Did you bring the paddles?

                         WOODY
          No. I wasn't even going to take this
          thing out, but I didn't want you to think
          I was just standing at the lake waiting
          for you.

          Why were you here?

          Bud told me to stand at the lake and wait
          for you.
          Doug nods. Bob walks up on the shore, holding a
          styrofoam cup.

                         BOB
          Hey, guys.

          Throw us that paddle.
          Bob nods and picks up a paddle. He throws it toward the
          canoe, but it lands ten yards short and sinks.

                         BOB

          lands even shorter. Bob looks around for another paddle.

                         DOUG
          Were those the only two paddles?

          Woody and Doug look around at the water. It's as still
          as glass. They sit there awkwardly as Bob waits on
          shore.

          INT. BUD AND MAGGIE'S HOUSE - SAME TIME

          A cook from the diner is at the kitchen stove, making
          something in a big pot, as a crowd of townspeople eat in
          the kitchen and dining room. MAGGIE and DUDLEY cross
          through the kitchen, and out to the front porch.

          but at least we're back in business.

          Sorry those jerks are in your diner.

                         MAGGIE
          Ah, we're used to them costing us money.
          Last year we spent more on window glass
          than pancake batter. All because of

          good for pancakes.

                         MAGGIE
          No, I meant... They damage the diner a
          lot. They damage the whole town. I'm
          just sorry you guys got dragged into it.
          You were just out to have a good
          vacation.
          Dudley looks at Maggie sincerely.

                         DUDLEY
          This has been the best vacation of my
          life. I met you.
          Maggie blushes.

                         MAGGIE
          You bikers probably tell all the girls
          that.
          This hits Dudley. He suddenly looks troubled.

                         DUDLEY
          Maggie, I have to tell you something.
          I'm not really a cool biker or a cool...
          anything. I'm a computer programmer. A
          nerd. My cat doesn't even like me. She
          watches me sleep and I don't know why. I
          think she's waiting for me to stop
          breathing. I'm just a... Geek. I'm
          sorry if you thought I was somebody I'm
          not.
          Maggie takes this in. After a moment, she smiles and
          kisses Dudley.

                         MAGGIE
          You're not a geek, Dudley. You're sweet
          and your honest and... You're the
          coolest guy I know. Your cat is crazy if
          it doesn't like you as much as I do.
          Dudley smiles. He has completely fallen for her.

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          Well, I better get back inside. I've got
          to set some chairs up in the family room

          then grits his teeth.

          Oh, people will eat. Don't you worry,

          DUDLEY kicks open the front door. JACK and the other
          Hells Angels are inside, drinking and carrying on.

                         DUDLEY
          Alright, let's end this!
          The Hells Angels don't even notice him. Dudley bites his
          lip in frustration.

                         (YELLS)
          Hey! !
          Dudley takes a table full of empty beer glasses and flips
          it over. Everyone in the diner goes silent and looks at
          him. Jack stands up and smiles.

                         JACK
          Well, well. One of you came to face the
          music, huh? That's brave. And stupid.
          The Hells Angels laugh. Dudley takes a deep breath and
          walks up to Jack.

                         DUDLEY
          I'm not here to face any music. I'm here
          to make you a deal. A deal I think you'd
          be smart to take.

                         JACK
          Yeah? What deal?

          You leave the town of Lucas, and my
          friends alone, and I do something for
          you. Something you can't live without.
          Jack looks interested. Dudley confidently sets a laptop
          on the counter, and punches a few keys. He swivels it
          around to show the gang.

          Guess what that means. Your gang doesn't
          have a website! Nothing! No way to tell
          people about your history, post photos,

          (laughs cockily, then)
          So they way I see it: I need a favor
          from you and you need a favor from me.
          Jack walks over to the computer and looks at Dudley for a
          moment. He then picks the computer up and smashes it
          down on the ground. It breaks into a hundred pieces.
          Jack smiles at Dudley and puts his foot through what's
          left of it. The Hells Angels stifle laughter. Dudley is
          starting to look a little nervous.

          Okay, then. Thanks for hearing me out.
          Dudley starts for the door, but several Hells Angels move
          over and block his path. Dudley stops and collects
          himself for a moment - then breaks into a panicked sprint
          for the other exit. The Hells Angels quickly spring into
          action and tackle him to the ground.

          That's it. He's never had a girlfriend
          so he's probably getting carried away.
          He once drank eighteen Mocha Latte's
          because the Starbucks clerk was smiling
          at him.

                         WOODY
          I remember that. His pee turned brown
          and he started crying.

                         DOUG
          Yeah. And the girl wasn't even smiling -
          she just had a cleft lip.

          the things that aren't safe, to create a
          world that you're happy being in. These
          Hells Angels don't want our ten thousand
          dollars. They want our dignity. They
          want us to be afraid of them just like
          this town is. And once they know we're
          afraid, they can do whatever they want.
          That's how these guys exist. That's how
          they ride into this town and tear it to
          pieces... Because people want to keep
          their lives safe so badly, they give up
          the best part about it...

          Jack looks back to the Hells Angels, who chuckle. This
          will be a quick fight.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          Well? You in, or are you too much of a
          bitch?
          The Hells Angels freeze. Jack grits his teeth in rage
          and turns back to Doug.

                         JACK
          All right. Let's party, tough guy.

                         DOUG
          Great.
          Doug nods, trying to look confidant, but it's quickly
          fading away.

          EXT. TOWN SQUARE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

          DOUG and JACK are standing "in their corners," opposite
          each other in the dirt parking lot. They're surrounded
          by a circle of Hells Angels, rowdily waiting for the
          fight to commence. WOODY and BOB coach Doug in his
          corner.

                         WOODY
          Just stay clear of the big punches.
          You've got more stamina than this guy.

                         DOUG
          All right. When do I hit back?

                         WOODY
          Um... Just try and get him tired. I
          don't think punches will do much to him.
          Doug gives Woody a concerned look. Woody shrugs. Jack
          steps into the circle and throws off his jacket.

          Tell my wife I won - then got hit by a
          truck.
          Doug takes a deep breath and starts into the circle.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)

                         (TO JACK)
          All right. Let's do this--
          Doug doesn't even finish his sentence as Jack lands a
          punch on the side of his head. Doug is stunned, as Jack
          sends his other fist crashing into Doug's forehead. Doug
          goes flying backwards, and falls down in the dirt. The
          Hells Angels cheer. Jack high fives them as Doug
          struggles back to his feet and looks back at Woody and
          Bob, cradling his face.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          Ow! Dammit Jesus that hurt!

                         (TO WOODY)
          It really hurts. Damn!
          Jack comes back over to Doug. Jack throws another right,
          but this time Doug ducks, still cradling his jaw.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          Yes!--
          But Doug is instantly punched in the stomach by Jack's
          other fist. Doug winces as he doubles over in agony.
          Drool drips out of his mouth. This isn't pretty.
          Jack takes him by the back of the shirt and lifts him
          into the air. The Hells Angels cheer as Jack tosses Doug
          five yards into the dirt.

                         JACK
          Don't get tired yet. The hurt is just
          beginning.
          Doug tries to stand back up, but it's getting harder. He
          slyly grabs a handful of sand as he starts to stand.

                         DOUG
          Hah!
          Doug whips around and throws the sand towards Jack's
          face; However, his aim is off. The sand hits Jack in the
          chest and falls away. Jack looks at Doug and shakes his
          head.

          Damn.
          Jack punches Doug square in the face again. Doug
          crumples to the ground in pain. Jack turns back to the
          Hells Angels.

                         JACK
          Man, this isn't even a workout.
          Jack laughs and puts his aviator sunglasses back on, as
          Doug quickly stands up and whips around at him.

                         DOUG
          Ahhh!
          Doug throws another handful of sand. This time he aims
          carefully; but Jack now has sunglasses on. The sand
          bounces harmlessly off the lenses. Doug cringes and
          waits for the punch, which comes like a freight train
          into his stomach. Doug doubles over again as Jack lines
          up another punch.

                         JACK
          This one's gonna break bone.

                         DOUG
          Wait! Wait--
          Doug straightens up and looks curiously at Jack's mouth.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          Your tooth-- That's an acute periodontal
          abscess.

                         JACK
          What?

                         DOUG
          look, I really hate you, but I don't want
          to feel responsible for a death. I'm a
          dentist. I took an oath. Same one as
          doctors. If the infection in that tooth
          gets to the root - it could seep into
          your nervous system. Just let me look--
          Doug slowly reaches towards Jack's mouth. Jack doesn't
          move.

                         JACK

          your gums are that swollen and your

                         BICUSPID--
          And Wham! Doug punches Jack square in the mouth. Jack
          goes down hard. Woody and Bob cheer.

                         BOB
          Yeah, Doug!

                         WOODY
          Quick! Start kicking him! Don't let him
          get up!
          Doug nods and goes to kick Jack, but Jack grabs the foot
          and pushes him backwards. Doug falls back to the dirt.
          Jack stands up and dusts himself off.

                         JACK
          All right. Now you're going to die.
          Jack approaches Doug, who closes his eyes and waits for
          the end.

                         WOODY
          Wait!!
          Jack turns around as WOODY walks into the circle.

                         WOODY (CONT'D)
          Doug's not the leader of this gang. I--
          Jack instantly punches Woody in the face. Woody falls
          down next to Doug. Doug turns his head to Woody.
          They're both bleeding from their noses and lips.

                         DOUG

          Jack looks at Bob.

                         JACK
          Anybody else the leader of this gang?
          Bob takes a deep breath, and bends down an grabs a long
          lead pipe. He starts towards Jack.

          Bob suddenly trips on the lead pipe and hits the ground.
          Doug shakes his head.

                         (TO BOB)

                         JACK
          Well, I guess that's all of you--
          DUDLEY, still covered in tape, comes running into the
          circle from the other side.

                         DUDLEY
          Ahhhhhhhhhhh!
          Dudley charges Jack, but his limited mobility results not
          in a tackle, but in him leaning on Jack. After a moment,
          Jack takes a step back and Dudley falls to the ground.

                         DUDLEY (CONT'D)
          Ow.
          Jack cracks his knuckles and looks to OILCAN.

                         JACK
          Give me the crowbar.
          Oilcan nods and hands it to Jack. Jack smiles at the
          four fallen Wild Hogs.

          Jack smiles as we hear:

                         SFX: SIREN
          Jack and the Hells Angels look up the road.
          ANGLE ON: DOWN STREET. CHARLEY is riding his shiny
          Harley Davidson police bike. Behind him are BUCK and
          EARL, driving a police cruiser. Behind the cruiser is a
          large group of people carrying rakes, hedge clippers,
          brooms... It's all the citizens of Lucas.

          motorcycle.

                         CHARLEY
          All right, Jack. That'll be enough of
          that.

                         JACK
          Are you kidding? And what makes you
          think you can ride a motorcycle without
          our permission?

                         CHARLEY
          I'll ride whatever I want from now on.
          I'm the sheriff of Lucas, and I'm not
          tolerating any more lawlessness.
          BOB helps DOUG, WOODY, and DUDLEY to their feet, as Jack
          takes a step towards Charley.

                         CHARLEY (CONT'D)
          I'd stop right there, Jack.
          Earl and Buck get out of the cruiser with two shotguns.
          They cock the guns and walk to Charley's side. Jack
          looks concerned.

                         JACK
          What? You're going to shoot us?

          No. Not unless you want to do something
          stupid like ignoring--
          Buck grabs his missing ear as he starts to loose his
          balance. He tips over and falls. As he hits the ground,
          the shotgun fires and hits OILCAN in the leg. Oilcan
          falls to the ground.

                         OILCAN
          Ahhhhhh! He shot me! I just got shot!!
          Charley looks over at Buck, then back to Jack.

          Um... Yeah, I guess we're going to shoot
          you.
          The Hells Angels suddenly look nervous, and back up a few
          steps. Charley steps towards Jack.

          stand up to you - so can everyone of us.

          The crowd cheers as THOMAS MILBORN, the guy Earl pointed
          out as a child molester, steps forward.

                         THOMAS MILBORN
          Yeah! People like you are the scum of
          the earth!
          The crowd is silent for a moment, then hesitantly gives a
          uncomfortable cheer. Charley turns back to the Hells
          Angels.

                         CHARLEY
          The point is, from now on you need to
          treat Lucas with kindness and respect.
          And when you do, you'll be treated the
          same. And if you don't...
          Charley looks over at OILCAN, who's tending to the bullet
          wound in his thigh.

                         CHARLEY (CONT'D)
          Then I guess we'll keep... shooting you.
          Got it?
          Jack looks at all the townspeople. He knows he's beaten.
          He nods bitterly.

                         CHARLEY (CONT'D)
          Good. Now I'd like you to untape our
          friend Dudley.
          Jack signals to one of the Hells Angels. He grabs
          Dudley's tape and spins him around to untape him.

                         DUDLEY
          Ow. Ow! Ow, ow. Ow. Ow!...
          After a painful minute, Dudley is untaped. Charley looks
          at Jack's jacket.

          And I believe that's his jacket.
          Jack begrudgingly takes off Dudley's "Wild Hogs" jacket
          and tosses it to him. Dudley proudly puts it on.

                         CHARLEY (CONT'D)
          And as I recall, that '51 Panhead was
          traded to Dudley.
          Jack looks over at the mint condition motorcycle and
          shakes his head.

                         JACK
          No way. He can have his Sportster back.

                         CHARLEY
          Uh uh. A deal's a deal, Jack.
          Jack grits his teeth and throws a set of keys at Dudley.
          The crowd chatters in approval as Dudley gets on the '51
          Panhead and starts the engine. He revs it a few times
          and Jack shoots Doug an infuriated glare.

                         JACK

                         (TO DOUG)
          Hope you're happy. You suburban posers
          are a disease. You need to learn some
          damn respect for real bikers.
          Doug smiles.

          We are the real bikers.
          As Doug says this, Dudley kicks the Panhead into gear and
          shoots forward - out of control. He instantly crashes
          into a steel light post. Everyone in the crowd cringes

                         DUDLEY LOOKS
          as the bike falls over in a crumpled heap.
          up from the ground.

                         DUDLEY
          Yeah, I'll take the Sportster back, I
          guess.

          EXT. STREET OUTSIDE POLICE STATION - LATER THAT AFTERNOON

          It's later that afternoon in Lucas. DOUG, BOB and WOODY
          walk to their motorcycles with CHARLEY, EARL and BUCK.

                         CHARLEY
          Well, I wish you guys would stay longer.

                         DOUG
          Ahh, we should be heading back. I think
          we've had enough excitement for one trip.
          Earl steps forward and shakes Doug's hand.

                         EARL
          You guys were a blessing to this place.
          I mean... I'm not going to get all
          emotional like "hamburger head" here
          always does.
          Earl laughs and looks to his left. Buck isn't there. He
          quickly looks to the right, where Buck is staring at him
          in disbelief.

                         BUCK
          What'd you just call me?

          It's just a little scar! I'm still
          better looking than you!
          Buck goes to storm off, but after a few steps, tilts left
          and falls over.

          Doug shakes his head, then turns to Woody and Bob.

          Woody takes a deep breath and shakes his head.

                         WOODY
          You know what? I think I'm going to
          press on. Keep heading West.

                         DOUG
          You are?

                         WOODY
          Yeah. Why not? I feel good about my
          life again. And I'd like to see what San
          Francisco's all about.
          Doug nods and looks to Bob. You can tell he wants to go.

                         BOB
          I'm in, too! Let's ride to San--
          Suddenly, a mini-van pulls up. KAREN and KELLY hop out.

          Kelly kisses Doug. He smiles, glad to see her.

                         DOUG
          Hey, baby. What are you doing here?

                         KELLY
          Karen said you guys were in trouble. I
          kept calling your cell, but somebody
          programmed it to not receive calls from
          our house.
          Doug shoots Woody a look.

                         (CAUGHT)

          Woody hurries over to his bike. KAREN turns to BOB.

          Well, I hope you guys had a nice trip.
          Now get in the van. We're going home.

                         BOB
          Um... Actually, we just decided we were
          going to keep pressing West for a few--

                         KAREN
          Oh, no. No way! I came all the way out
          here, rented a car, drove to this podunk

                         LITTLE TOWN--
          As Karen is saying this, Bob looks over at the guys, then
          back to Karen. He can't take it anymore.

                         BOB
          --Karen!
          Karen stops talking, shocked by Bob raising his voice.

                         BOB (CONT'D)
          Listen to me. This is My vacation and if
          I want to ride on with my friends, well
          that's what I'm going to do! And if you
          have a problem with that, well... Tough
          shit!
          There's a moment of silence as Karen absorbs this. The
          guys all look at Bob proudly. After a few seconds,
          Karen's face softens.

                         KAREN

                         (SUDDENLY MEEK)
          Okay. Sorry... Just... be careful.
          Karen shyly kisses Bob on the cheek. Bob can't believe
          it.

                         BOB
          I will. And... I love you.
          Bob smiles at her and gets on his bike.
          ANGLE ON: DOUG and KELLY. Kelly looks at Doug.

          concerned.

          Ahh. We can risk it.
          Kelly smiles and kisses him proudly. Doug grabs her face
          and kisses her back... Then, turns to Woody and Bob.

          motorcycle. Next to him, is MAGGIE, sitting in the rusty
          sidecar now attached to Dudley's bike. She's wearing
          Dudley's goggles and nods to him encouragingly. Dudley
          looks back over to Doug, Bob and Woody.

          It's freedom, joy and friendship all wrapped up in one
          expression. The camera PANS AROUND THEM, and finally
          ZOOMS IN ON DOUG. We see his eyes sparkle a little bit,
