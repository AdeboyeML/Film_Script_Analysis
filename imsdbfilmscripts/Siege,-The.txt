               FADE IN:

               EXT. TYRE, LEBANON - DAY

               A coast road. Date palms. Burnt-out hulks that once were 
               Russian T-54 TANKS have long ago been left to rust in the 
               sun. A 4-door MERCEDES hurtles down the ancient road.

                                     DEVEREAUX (V.O.)
                         We're online for exactly two minutes.

               A SATELLITE VIEW

               Of the same scene. A grainy IMAGE of the car, and some 
               distance away, a moving cluster of animals. They are:

               HERD OF SHEEP

               As seen at ground level. Two SHEPHERDS goad them forward. In 
               the distance, the MERCEDES approaches.

               FLASH CUT -- NEWS FOOTAGE (STOCK)

               U.S. Army medics and rescue workers frantically sift through 
               the rubble of a collapsed barracks.

                                     CNN REPORTS (V.O.)
                         "...the single worst casualty in the 
                         history of American military --"

               BACK TO -- THE COAST ROAD

               The Mercedes barrels down the road, doing at least 80 mph.

               THE SATELLITE VIEW

               Shows that the car is fast approaching the point where the 
               herd of sheep are about to cross the road.

               FLASH CUT -- NEWS FOOTAGE (STOCK)

               Amidst the rubble, the dead are zipped into body bags.

                                     CNN REPORTS (V.O.)
                         "-- the truck, carrying high 
                         explosives is believed to have hit 
                         the barracks --

               BACK TO -- THE COAST ROAD

               The driver of the Mercedes hits his horn but doesn't slow 
               down. In addition to the driver and a bodyguard, an OLD MAN 
               WITH A HENNAED BEARD, a turban, and sunglasses sits in back.

               THE SATELLITE VIEW

               As the Mercedes closes with the sheep:

                                     DEVEREAUX (V.O.)
                         Slow down.

               BACK TO -- THE COAST ROAD

               As if on command, the Mercedes finally slows as the sheep 
               move lazily across the road.

               FLASH CUT -- NEWS FOOTAGE (STOCK)

               President Clinton addresses reporters in the White House.

                                     PRESIDENT CLINTON
                         "To any lengths, anywhere in the 
                         world, to bring these people to 
                         justice."

               BACK TO -- THE COAST ROAD

               Inside the Mercedes, they watch as the Shepherd urinates and 
               the sheep mill about in the middle of the road. The driver 
               rolls down his window to scream in Arabic at:

               THE POOR SHEPHERD

               Who hurries to button his fly. It is only as we look closer 
               that we see the silenced muzzle of:

               COLT COMMANDO RIFLE

               Protruding from the sleeve of his jhallabah. And then:

               THE HERD OF SHEEP

               Fill the frame, blocking our view of the Mercedes, and for a 
               moment, all we can HEAR is their gentle bleating. But as 
               they clear frame, we can see that:

               THE MERCEDES

               Has been turned into an abattoir, its windshield shattered 
               and bloody. The driver slumps over the steering wheel, the 
               bodyguard is half out of the window. And in the distance:

               WITH A MAGICIAN'S ALACRITY

               One Shepherd pulls a BLACK HOOD over the Sheik's head while 
               the other injects him with a HYPODERMIC. The first Shepherd 
               activates a SATCHEL CHARGE and swings it into the Mercedes 
               while the second straps the Sheik into a HARNESS... A BALLOON 
               self-inflates and hurtles aloft, pulling a cable attached to 
               the Sheik's harness.

               AN MC-130 COMBAT TALON AIRCRAFT

               Its "Whiskers" in the nose of the aircraft snag the cable 
               without slowing and roars off, the Sheik dangling unconscious 
               beneath -- just as the satchel charges EXPLODE the Mercedes.

               THE SATELLITE VIEW

               Records impassively for a moment, then breaks up into static.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Gotcha.

               IN A SAFE HOUSE -- SOMETIME LATER

               A pale, diminished Sheik sits at a steelcase table. A STEEL 
               COT and a STEEL TOILET. Closed-circuit cameras in the corner.

               Opposite him: the man, whose voice we have only heard: GENERAL 
               WILLIAM DEVEREAUX -- and though he wears a civilian suit, 
               his bearing betrays his pedigree. His considerable charm and 
               habitual skepticism are as much a product of self-discipline 
               as his close-order drill.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Nobody knows you're here. Not your 
                         people. Not even my President. You'll 
                         die here alone and be buried unknown -- 
                         barring some miracle.

               The SHEIK speaks a few words in Arabic.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         -- God? GOD?
                              (looks at him)
                         What you eat. Whether you eat. Sleep. 
                         Pain. Absence of pain. I decide. I 
                         make the day and the night. Even the 
                         way you got here -- a hand that 
                         reached down from the sky?
                              (looks at him)
                         God? I am your new God.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. MOSQUE - DAWN

               A MUEZZIN climbs a spiral staircase, enters a turret-like 
               room, CLICKS ON a microphone and CHANTS the call to prayer.

                                     MUEZZIN
                         Allahuh Akbar...

               HUNDREDS OF BELIEVERS prostrate themselves on prayer rugs. 
               At the door, hundreds of SHOES are lined up, work boots, 
               expensive loafers, a range of social classes represented.

               ON THE STREET

               Shopkeepers pause to kneel and pray. In Arab homes, parents 
               and children do the same. And as we PULL BACK from:

               THE MINARET

               Of the Mosque, we DISCOVER not an Arab city, but instead the 
               unmistakable skyline of:

               DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN

               The World Trade Ctr, Wall Street, The Federal building.

               IN THE FBI SITUATION ROOM

               Two AGENTS hurry through the bullpen. TINA OSU, 32, sharp, 
               and FRANK HADDAD, Lebanese with an insouciant grin.

                                     TINA
                         Brooklyn South issued a code blue 
                         less than two minutes ago. They think 
                         hostages are involved.

                                     FRANK
                         Black-and-whites on the scene?

                                     TINA
                         Setting up a perimeter now.

                                     FRANK
                         Residence or business?

                                     TINA
                         A bus.

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               THE 99 BUS -- SEEN FROM ABOVE

               Surrounded by a phalanx of Black-and-Whites.

               BACK TO -- THE SITUATION ROOM

               They have been joined by Anthony Hubbard, the ASAC.

                                     HUB
                         SWAT?

                                     FRANK
                         On the way.

                                     HUB
                         Negotiator?

                                     TINA
                         Rolling.

                                     HUB
                         Bomb squad?

               THE 99 BUS

               The BOMB SQUAD approaches. We SEE terrified PASSENGERS inside.

               BACK TO -- HUB AND FRANK, EXITING THE FEDERAL BUILDING

                                     HUB
                         How soon can we get there --?

                                     FRANK
                         In this traffic, maybe tomorrow.

               BACK TO -- THE 99 BUS

               As a police TECHIE inserts a dentist's mirror through a 
               drilled hole in the bus's door, the L.E.D. begins to BLINK 
               and the passengers SCREAM and dive for cover. An EXPLOSION.

               BACK TO -- HUB AND FRANK, IN THE CAR

               Frank is listening to a cell phone.

                                     FRANK
                         Oh, fuck. It just blew.

               BACK TO -- THE 99 BUS

               The doors hang off their hinges. As the PASSENGERS tumble 
               off, we SEE they are covered in BLUE PAINT.

               BACK TO -- HUB AND FRANK, IN THE CAR

                                     HUB
                         -- What?!

                                     FRANK
                         -- That's what they're telling me.

                                     HUB
                         -- And nobody's hurt?

               Frank nods. Hubs closes his eyes in gratitude.

                                     HUB
                         Thank God.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE JOINT FBI/NYPD TERRORISM TASK FORCE - FEDERAL BLDG

               They're listening to a tape-recording, altered by a VO-CORDER:

                                     TAPED VOICE
                         -- our first and last warning.

               As the MESSAGE continues, we PAN the faces: MIKE JOHANNSON, 
               squad supervisor, and DANNY SUSSMAN, representing NYPD.

                                     TAPED VOICE
                         We expect our demand to be met. There 
                         will be no negotiation. That is all.

                                     TINA
                         Demand for what? You hear any demand?

                                     MIKE
                         You sure this is all they got?

                                     SUSSMAN
                         That's it.

                                     FRANK
                         Maybe it's performance art.

               Sussman shoots him a look. Clearly Haddad enjoys pushing his 
               buttons. Finally, Hub stands up.

                                     HUB
                         -- Okay. Blue paint. Voice-altering 
                         technology --

                                     FRANK
                         -- available from The Sharper Image 
                         catalogue.

                                     SUSSMAN
                         Last I looked they weren't offering 
                         exploding paint bombs.

                                     HUB
                         Still, the rhetoric sounds political. 
                         Militia?

                                     TINA
                         Not their style.

                                     HUB
                         Frank --?

                                     FRANK
                         Jihad isn't known for their sense of 
                         humor, and Hamas is raising so much 
                         money here, why queer their deal?

                                     TINA
                         Anyway, isn't Green the color of 
                         Islam, not blue?

                                     FRANK
                         -- And, excuse me, but why do we 
                         immediately assume they're Arabs?

                                     HUB
                         I want a composite of the suspects 
                         in circulation by the end of business 
                         today. Tina, you cross-check it 
                         against the mainframe. Mike, have 
                         you got the lab analysis on the paint?

                                     MIKE
                         Not yet...

                                     HUB
                         -- See if any was sold in quantity 
                         the last month. Danny --

               Tina's phone buzzes. She picks it up as Hub keeps going:

                                     HUB
                         -- find out what stop these guys got 
                         on the bus, maybe there's a witness.

                                     FRANK
                         Hub... I think we're all eager to 
                         give up our weekends on this. It 
                         just occurs to me, has anybody even 
                         committed a crime here? I mean, 
                         assault with a deadly color?

               Hub deals with Haddad's irreverence by ignoring it.

                                     HUB
                         Here's what I don't like. They know 
                         explosives. They know our response 
                         time. They put in a call and walk.

               A young agent, FRED DARIUS, hands Hub a piece of paper:

                                     FRED
                         Excuse me, sir. I think you should 
                         see this. Came in on the Fax.

               Only two words are written: "RELEASE HIM."

                                     HUB
                         Release him? Him who? Who are we 
                         holding?

                                     HUB
                              (looks at the fax)
                         Why be coy about it?

                                     SUSSMAN
                         You think it's phony?

                         badge over at the warehouse where 
                         they're working on the bus. Our tech 
                         guys want to know if we're cooperating 
                         with any other agencies on this thing.

               Off Hub's look, we:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               AN OLD WAREHOUSE IN BROOKLYN - DUSK

               Hub and Haddad join AGENT FLOYD ROSE, a tall Black man.

                                     AGENT ROSE
                         -- She's looking for wiring signatures 
                         on the device and asking for copies 
                         of any latent prints we've managed 
                         to lift.

                                     HUB
                         -- Agency?

                                     AGENT ROSE
                         Smells like it. Turns out she's also 
                         been talking to some of the 
                         passengers.

               THEY OPEN THE DOOR

               In the klieg lights -- THE BUS. Men in white coats dust every 
               inch and generally behave as if investigating a crashed UFO. 
               In their midst, a young WOMAN, midwestern pretty in a serious 
               suit. She looks up as Hub enters.

                                     HUB
                         Hi.

                                     WOMAN
                         Hi, there.

                                     HUB
                         Special Agent Anthony Hubbard. FBI.

                                     WOMAN
                         Oh, shit, I've been trying to liaise 
                         with you all day. My name is Elise 
                         Kraft, National Security Council.

               She offers her hand. Hub doesn't take it yet.

                                     HUB
                         -- And you've been trying to "liaise" 
                         with me all day? Did you think of 
                         trying the phone book, Elise? We 
                         have fourteen lines, that's not 
                         counting the unlisted ones.

                                     ELISE
                              (still holds out hand)
                         Hi, I'm Elise Kraft, National Security 
                         Council.

               Finally, he takes her hand. And doesn't let go.

                                     HUB
                         And I'm Colin Powell. What exactly 
                         do you people want with my bus.

               She tries to take her hand away, but he tightens his grip.

                                     ELISE
                         We're all on the same team here, 
                         Agent Hubbard.

                                     HUB
                         Who exactly is "we" on this particular 
                         team, Elise?

                                     ELISE
                         It's never the question that's 
                         indiscreet, only the answer.

               He smiles. She smiles back. Convinced she's charmed him.

                                     HUB
                         Tell you what, you send me an official 
                         inter-agency request for cooperation 
                         on this and I'll give you copies of 
                         everything we come up with. Otherwise, 
                         get your ass on out of here before 
                         you contaminate my crime scene any 
                         more than you already have.

                                     ELISE
                         There's no reason to be nasty.

                                     HUB
                         You think this is nasty?
                              (smiles)
                         In case you haven't heard. The CIA 
                         has no charter to operate 
                         domestically. Which puts you in 
                         violation of federal law.

                         suggest you reread the paragraph on

                         well within my authority.

                         Special Order 12333 refers to domestic 
                         terrorism. You got something you 
                         want to "share" with me?
                              (he waits... but no

                         Unfortunately, not yet. But as soon 
                         as I do, I'll --

                         Here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna 
                         have a couple my "teammates" here 
                         escort you back to wherever you came 
                         from. And then I'm gonna go back to 
                         the office and wait for that official 
                         cooperation request. Okay by you?

                                     ELISE
                         Swell.

                                     HUB
                         Nice meeting you, Elise. Is that 
                         Elise with an "E" or an "A"?

                                     ELISE
                         Nice meeting you, too, Special Agent 
                         Hubbard.

               OUTSIDE THE WAREHOUSE

               Hub watches as Elise is led away by two AGENTS. Agent Rose 
               stands nearby.

                                     HUB
                         Tail her.

               NICE LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

               In Frank Haddad's home. The Haddad's are celebrating the day 
               FRANK JR. has finished reading the Holy Koran.

                                     FRANK JR (O.S.)
                              (in Arabic)

                         the merciful. Say: I seek refuge in 
                         the Lord of Men, the King of Men."

               Frank's TEACHER offers the final benediction. Those who are 
               Muslim cover their face with their palms.

                                     TEACHER
                              (in Arabic)
                         "Make me know that which I have become 
                         ignorant of; and make me recite it 
                         in the hours of the night and the 
                         day; and make it an argument for me 
                         O Thou Sustainer of all the worlds!"

               Later --

               The guests mingle, eat pastries and drink sweet tea.

                         things?

               Nearby, Mike and Danny observe them.

                                     DANNY
                         -- He doing her?

                         Really? I wonder if she likes white 
                         guys.

                         I wonder if she likes bald guys.

               Hub, meanwhile, congratulates Frank's wife, NAJIBA.

                                     HUB

               INT. HUB'S OFFICE - EARLY MORNING

               Hub is looking at surveillance photos of Elise. Frank enters.

                                     FRANK
                         You sleep here?

                              doesn't look up)
                         Immigration called.

               A SMALL GREEN ROOM -- AS SEEN THROUGH A TWO-WAY MIRROR

               Hub and Frank watch a dark-skinned MAN being questioned by a 
               uniformed OFFICIAL. An INS Supervisor shows them a false-
               bottomed suitcase stuffed with money.

                                     INS OFFICIAL

                         smurf, right? Then I think, 
                         considering the gentleman's 
                         nationality, plus where he's been 
                         recently, we better call Frank.

               IN THE ROOM

               The official hopes volume breaks the language barrier.

                         ...so, Kahlil, you're saying this is 
                         an INHERITANCE? Somebody DIED and 
                         you're bringing them the MONEY?

               The dark-skinned man is trying to keep up:

                                     KAHLIL
                         No, no... dhouri.

               Small puckered SCARS. The INS guy looks confused.

               THE VAN WYCK EXPRESSWAY

               Hub and Frank in a rental CONTOUR, tail Khalil, in a cab:

                              (to Frank)
                         -- What are we in?

                         Back home, the security services'd 
                         be up this guy's ass with a poker, 
                         but what do we do, we let him go.

                         Not my first date, Hub.

                         He's taking the BQE. Looks like it's 
                         Brooklyn.

                              (raises his voice)
                         And bring us a radio.

                                     FRANK
                         I get reimbursed for this, right?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ATLANTIC AVENUE - BROOKLYN

               The Third World. Teeming, roiling, Kinshasha meets Beirut 
               meets Tel Aviv meets Moscow. Hand-written shop signs in Arabic 
               and Hebrew, boom boxes throbbing out "Oum Khatoum," the latest 
               neo-Palestinian techno-rock.

               KHALIL pays the taxi driver and starts off on foot. Hub's 
               CONTOUR pulls over a safe distance behind and waits. An AGENT 
               passes by and slips a WALKIE-TALKIE through the open window.

               MAN CARRYING GROCERIES

               Falls in behind Khalil, who ducks into a storefront, where 
               WE CAN SEE him buying a Coca Cola and a Baby Ruth bar.

               IN THE CONTOUR

                                     FRANK

                         Fred's hovering. Patsy, take over...

               A WOMAN WITH A STROLLER replaces the man carrying groceries.

                                     HUB
                         ...Tell her to watch out for

                         I got the Judge.

                         ...Good morning, Sir. How're things 
                         in the Second Circuit this morning...? 
                         ...I hear you... Listen, Judge, we're 
                         in a kind of situation here...

               KHALIL is on the move again.

                                     HUB
                              (on the phone)
                         Hold on, will ya, Judge?
                              (into walkie-talkie)
                         Is he talking to somebody, who's he 
                         talking to? Are we getting film?

               FROM A GREAT DISTANCE

               An AGENT with a TELEPHOTO snaps a picture of Khalil, who has 
               paused to chat with a PALESTINIAN of patrician good-looks.

                                     HUB
                              (covering the phone)
                         -- Frank?

                                     FRANK
                         Don't know him. If we were allowed 
                         to get sound on them, we'd know him.

               The walkie-talkie CRACKLES TO LIFE, confirming the photos.

                         He's making him. Shit. Fuck. He's --

               Khalil has a sixth sense from a lifetime on the West Bank. 
               All of a sudden, he BREAKS INTO A RUN.

                                     HUB
                              (keys radio)
                         Go, go, go!!! All units --

               He slams the car into gear and PEELS OUT into traffic.

               SIX SURVEILLANCE TEAMS

               In various guises, break cover and SPRINT after Khalil, who 
               shifts into overdrive. Cars SCREECH to avoid flattening him.

               Hub's CONTOUR pulls into traffic and finds his way blocked 
               by a narrow passage between double-parked cars. He goes for 
               it, SCRAPING his way between them.

                                     FRANK
                         Christ!

                                     HUB
                              (on the phone)
                         Judge, I'm gonna have to call you 
                         back...

               KHALIL SPRINTS

               Into an open-air MARKET, KNOCKING DOWN veiled WOMEN with 
               bags of fruit and vegetables. He VAULTS over stalls.

               The CONTOUR scrapes PARKED CARS as it swerves into an alley, 
               desperately trying to cut off Khalil's escape route.

                                     FRANK
                         Shit --! I didn't take the insurance.

               A SOCCER BALL bounces into Hub's peripheral vision, followed 
               by TWO BOYS.

               HUB SLAMS THE CONTOUR INTO THE WALL

               To avoid killing the two boys. Hub gets out of the car and 
               continues the pursuit on foot. He's gaining on Khalil, when:

               A VAN

               Bears down on Khalil, its doors sliding open as TWO PAIRS OF 
               HANDS reach out and ANOTHER MAN appears out of nowhere and 
               BODYCHECKS Khalil into the van and jumps in after him.

                                     HUB
                         What the --?

               The van BURNS RUBBER and DISAPPEARS into traffic.

               MINUTES LATER --

               An impromptu huddle in the alley. AGENTS gather in a circle 
               as RADIOS SQUELCH and HELICOPTERS circle above.

                                     FRED
                         They just found the van. Doesn't 
                         look like they're gonna find any 
                         prints.

               The Agent who took the pictures pulls a color xerox-type 
               PHOTO from a digital printer in his car. Hub looks at the 
               picture of Khalil and the good-looking Palestinian.

                                     HUB
                         Run him down, bring him in.

               Fred hands a cell phone to Hub.

                                     FRED
                         Floyd Rose.

                                     HUB
                         Go, Floyd.

               As he listens, the first trace of a smile graces Hub's face.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               AN ORDINARY HOUSE

               In an ordinary neighborhood. Hub sits in an UNMARKED CAR. 
               Agent Rose climbs into the front seat.

                                     AGENT ROSE
                         I've got two in the Plymouth, at 
                         least three inside, and see that guy 
                         walking his dog...? He did his 
                         business about an hour ago and they're 
                         still walking.

               IN ANOTHER CAR --

                                     DANNY
                         I had a dog like that once.

                                     FRANK
                         It's not his dog, numbnuts. They're 
                         spies.

                                     DANNY
                         The dog works for the CIA?

               Their radio CRACKLES to life. It's Hub.

                                     HUB (V.O.)
                              (over the radio)
                         All units report in turn.

               We HEAR "Unit 1 is good to go," "Unit 2, we're ready to rock."

                                     HUB
                         Let's roll.

               THE MAN WALKING THE DOG

               Is suddenly double-teamed by TWO AGENTS.

                                     AGENT - MIKE
                         Federal Agents. Hands behind your 
                         back --

               A third AGENT throws his jacket over the dog.

               TWO UNMARKED CARS

               Fishtail across the quiet street, boxing in the Plymouth as 
               an AGENT from the sidewalk thrusts a 12-gauge Remington Pump 
               in through the driver's window.

                                     AGENT - FRED
                         -- Keep 'em where we can see 'em, 
                         thank you very much.

               THE DOOR TO THE HOUSE

               Is BLOWN-IN by a specially-designed SHOTGUN. Two MEN, eating 
               take-out are surprised by Frank and Tina, their guns drawn.

                                     FRANK
                         Hi, guys, I expect you know the drill.

               Hub continues warily from one empty room to the next. A 
               stairway leads downstairs. As Hub starts cautiously down, 
               muted VOICES can be heard. Reaching the bottom, he sees:

               KHALIL

               Sitting in a chair. Behind him stands one of FREELANCERS 
               from the warehouse. And opposite him, in a barca-lounger:

               ELISE KRAFT -- Somehow amidst the normalcy of the furnished 
               basement is a palpable feeling of menace.

               As Hub shows himself, one of the Freelancers points a Glock 
               .9 at his head. Hub just stares him down.

                                     ELISE
                         Ralph, spare us.

               The freelancer lowers the gun. Hub looks at Khalil, whose 
               face is badly bruised.

                                     ELISE
                         I never touched him.

                                     HUB
                         Really? I'm taking him into custody 
                         just the same.

                                     ELISE
                         What are you going to charge him 
                         with? Jaywalking?
                              (Hub stares at her)
                         I don't suppose we could just have a 
                         little chat with him here first?

                                     HUB
                         Not in this lifetime.

                                     ELISE
                         You know, Hub... may I call you Hub? 
                         If you guys hadn't blown the 
                         surveillance, we'd have been able to 
                         follow the money. What do you think, 
                         Khalil, you would have led us right 
                         to your friends, wouldn't you?

               Khalil averts his eyes from any contact with her.

                                     HUB
                         What friends --? What have you got 
                         for me, Elise?... Enlighten me.
                              (she stonewalls)
                         Tell me now or tell me downtown.

               Still nothing. Hub calls out to his agents.

                                     HUB
                         Get this guy out of here and book 
                         him.

               As the other agents approach Khalil:

                                     ELISE
                         One phone call and he's mine again. 
                         You know the number. I have --

                         you have "the right to an attorney.

                                     ELISE
                              (overlapping him)
                         Oh, come on... Do you have any idea 
                         what you're starting here, the kind 
                         of shitstorm you're about to --

                         Assault.

               As he heads out of the room, he says to a waiting Agent.

                                     HUB
                         Cuff her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               HUB'S UNMARKED CAR

               Elise sits, handcuffed, alone in the back seat. Up front, 
               Frank is driving with Hub beside him.

                                     FRANK
                         So, Elise... You okay back there, 
                         you don't get carsick or anything? 
                         Those handcuffs too tight --?

                                     ELISE
                         Shouf mountains, right? Shiite or 
                         Sunni?

                                     FRANK
                         Wow. You're really good.
                              (to Hub)
                         She's really good.

                                     HUB
                         You ready to tell us what's going on 
                         here, Elise --? Was the paintbomb a 
                         warning?

                                     ELISE
                              (to Haddad)
                         American University of Beirut? I was 
                         there from '79 to 82.

                                     FRANK
                              (a look to Hub)
                         No shit?

                                     ELISE
                         My father taught Economics. Henry 
                         Kraft?

                                     HUB
                         Is there a terrorist cell operating 
                         in this city that we are unaware of?

                                     ELISE
                              (ignoring him; to 
                              Haddad)
                         Such a tragedy. Growing up in that 
                         city was... paradise. Like an exotic 
                         Paris, wasn't it, Frank --?

                                     HUB
                         You ever been in Rikers, Elise? You 
                         know what happens in there?

               Elise looks at him, utterly unfazed by the threat.

                                     ELISE
                         ...Yum.

               Frank's BEEPER goes off. As they look at one another, we:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ABOUT A MILLION COP CARS

               Red lights flashing, have sealed off a Brooklyn Street. On 
               the rooftops SWAT teams are already deploying.

               SHARPSHOOTERS politely insinuate themselves into the 
               surrounding family APARTMENTS and take up firing POSITIONS.

               THE 87 BUS

               Stands alone in the middle of the street. Through a Marksman's 
               SCOPE we SEE the terrified passengers forced to stand, catch 
               glimpses of the TERRORISTS, obscured by the hostages.

               Hub confers with the NYPD officer-in-charge.

                                     NYPD OFFICER
                         -- definitely Arab-types, only this 
                         time they're still in there...

                                     HUB
                         Any communication at all?

                                     NYPD OFFICER
                         Nope. It's weird they're just in 
                         there.

                                     HUB
                         Get the frequency of the driver's 
                         radio and patch it through to this 
                         number. We need two lines. Frank, 
                         get a negotiator out here.

                                     NYPD OFFICER #2
                         Sir, they've got kids in there. We 
                         count six.

               This rocks Hub for a moment but he covers it well.

                                     HUB
                         That gives us something to work with.

               BACK AT THE CAR

               Elise leans forward as Hub opens the driver's door.

                                     ELISE
                         What's happening out there...

               Hub takes off his jacket, folds it carefully on the seat.

                                     ELISE
                         They've taken another bus, haven't 
                         they? Talk to me...

                                     HUB
                         Oh, now you want to talk. You want 
                         to be my friend, is that it?

                                     ELISE
                         Listen, these guys are the real deal.

                                     HUB
                         How do you know?

               She just looks at him.

                                     HUB
                         Is there a terrorist cell operating 
                         in Brooklyn?

                                     ELISE
                              (a long moment)
                         Yes.

                                     HUB
                         Was the blue paint a warning?

                                     ELISE
                         Yes. And I'm afraid this time they'll 
                         blow the bus.

                                     HUB
                         If they wanted to blow the bus then 
                         why haven't they blown the bus --?

                                     ELISE
                         I... don't know.

               He starts away.

                                     ELISE
                         Agent Hubbard. Please. Maybe I can 
                         help.

               A COMMAND POST

               Has been hastily improvised behind a SWAT van.

                         The driver's name is Larry Kaiser. 
                         He says they've got explosives 
                         strapped to their chests, they got 
                         automatic weapons, and they're 
                         speaking Arabic.

                                     HUB
                         Where the hell's the negotiator?

                                     FRANK
                         Tunnel's got twenty minute delays 
                         and they're working on both bridges.

                                     HUB
                              (to the cop)
                         What else did he say about the device? 
                         Did he describe it at all? Anything 
                         about a button, or a cord, or...

               THE FIRST ENG TRUCK

               Pulls up and raises its satellite dish.

                                     ELISE
                              (almost involuntary)
                         Oh, God.

               Frank turns to look at her. She is suddenly pale.

                                     ELISE
                              (as it dawns on her)
                         ...They're not here to negotiate.

                                     FRANK
                         Meaning?

                                     ELISE
                         They were waiting for the cameras.

               Hub is deep in conversation with the cops. Frank interrupts.

                                     FRANK
                         -- Hub...

               Hub looks up. Frank nods for Elise to repeat what she said.

                                     ELISE
                         They're want the newsies here. They 
                         want everybody watching.

               Hub and Frank look at each other. Can this be true?

                                     ELISE
                         You've got the shooters in place?

                                     FRANK
                         -- So?

                                     ELISE
                         Use 'em.

                                     HUB
                         What?

                                     ELISE
                         Kill 'em now.

               They just look at her.

                                     ELISE
                         It's lose-lose any way you play it... 
                         Do you want to lose little or lose 
                         big?

               The NYPD officer has been listening:

                                     NYPD OFFICER
                         I got the marksmen on the com -- 
                         They're looking for a clean shot.

               As the Policeman waits for a response on his radio, two more 
               NEWS VANS pull up. The MEDIA CIRCUS has come to town: 
               reporters breathlessly offer their live, on-the-scene reports. 
               Hub and Elise stare at one another.

                                     NYPD OFFICER
                         Shooter says they've got the 
                         passengers all standing in the aisles. 
                         He says, no go.

               Hub can see the dread in Elise's eyes. As the seconds tick 
               away, TWO NEWS HELICOPTER jockey for position above.

                                     HUB
                              (to the cops)
                         We have rules of engagement we're 
                         gonna follow here, folks, so put the 
                         safeties back on your weapons.
                              (looks at Elise)
                         Nobody's killing anybody until we 
                         see what's what.

               He grabs the phone.

                                     HUB
                              (on the phone)
                         Larry, this is Agent Hubbard of the 
                         FBI, I'll be negotiating our way out 
                         of this. Let me talk to one of them... 
                         I know... I know. You just hang in 
                         there, Larry... No, don't worry, 
                         I've got somebody here who can 
                         translate.

               He looks over at Frank, who's listening on another cell.

                                     HUB
                              (on the phone)
                         Sir, -- My name is Anthony Hubbard. 
                         I don't have any authority to make 
                         deals, or respond to demands. I just 
                         want to find out if you need anything 
                         in there? If any of the passengers 
                         are in need of medical attention?

               He waits as Frank translates. Hub covers the mouthpiece.

                                     HUB
                         -- Frank?

                                     FRANK
                         I don't know if they understand.

                                     HUB
                              (on the phone)
                         Sir, is there anything you want to 
                         say to me? That I can tell my people 
                         here?

                                     FRANK
                         The guy's just breathing into the 
                         phone, maybe they're not even Arabs.

                                     HUB
                              (on the phone)
                         I get the feeling you don't want to 
                         talk, but will you listen --? 
                         ...Whatever grievance you have, 
                         whatever quarrel -- surely it doesn't 
                         involve these children --

               Still no response.

                                     HUB
                              (on the phone)
                         So I'm gonna ask you to... please... 
                         let... the... children go.

               No response -- then suddenly, the bus doors HISS OPEN

               And six bewildered, ashen-faced CHILDREN step out before the 
               doors HISS closed behind them. As Hub and a couple of the 
               cops hurry out from behind the barricades to help the children 
               cross the NO-MAN'S LAND to safety, a smattering of APPLAUSE 
               breaks out among the cops. Elise tries to hold back tears.

                                     FRANK
                         Okay, here we go...

                                     HUB
                              (on the phone)
                         Thank you, sir. I appreciate that 
                         gesture, I really do. The best way 
                         to get what you want in these 
                         situations is to show yourself to be 
                         reasonable. As you've just done.
                              (Haddad translates)
                         Now we've got some more to talk 
                         about...

               Elise watches as the news cameras zoom in.

                                     HUB
                              (on the phone)
                         I am unarmed, as you can see. So I 
                         propose... You let the rest of the 
                         passengers go, and I take their 
                         place... That way, there's no pizza 
                         deliveries or bathroom breaks to 
                         worry about -- and all these --
                              (indicates SWAT teams)
                         -- people... will disappear.

               Frank shakes his head, don't do this. Hub's look says 
               translate it. Frank does it. They all wait.

                                     HUB
                              (on the phone)
                         I'm gonna take your silence to mean 
                         you're considering my offer --

               Elise looks at Frank, she can't help but admire his bravery.

                                     HUB
                         How about we just start with a few 
                         of the elderly people you got on 
                         there. It's got to be hard for the 
                         older folks to be standing all this 
                         time.

               Hub looks back at Frank. Still no response.

               AND THEN THE BUS DOORS HISS OPEN AGAIN. A few elderly 
               PASSENGERS start down the steps.

                                     HUB
                              (on the phone)
                         Thank you, sir. Now let's just let 
                         these --

               THE EXPLOSION OF THE BUS

               Hurls Hub backwards as:

               ALL SOUND FADES OUT

               To be replaced by a high-end, almost electronic WHITE NOISE.

               SHRAPNEL

               Imbeds itself into car doors, bus benches, doorways as every 
               WINDOW in a three-block radius is SHATTERED...

               RED BLOOD

               Replaces blue paint in a horrific shower.

               HUB

               Fights for consciousness.

               AGENTS

               Rush to his side to see if he is alright -- but WE CANNOT 
               HEAR them. Though their mouths move it is only the WHITE 
               NOISE that overwhelms us -- as we realize that Hub has been 
               momentarily DEAFENED by the blast.

               When at last Hub manages to speak, his words are MUFFLED and 
               INDISTINCT -- as if the playback heads of a tape recorder 
               needed to be cleaned.

                                     HUB
                         I'm... alright. I'm --

               Frank Haddad bends down close and we can lip-read him saying, 
               "Just hang in there, buddy. . ."

                                     HUB
                         -- okay... Just let me --

               And then he leans over to VOMIT in the street.

               THE SOUND OF SIRENS

               Slowly bleeds in through the white noise -- mercifully for 
               us, and for Hub, who wipes his mouth and looks up, realizing 
               that his HEARING is coming back. He reaches for Frank's 
               outstretched hand and stands, albeit woozily.

                                     HUB
                         Is anybody --

               But the look in Frank's eyes says it all.

               THE DEVASTATION

               Is numbing. IMAGES we associate with other countries. And 
               then he sees Elise. Her face is cut and bleeding, but as 
               their eyes meet, her look is one of absolute compassion.

                                                               HARD CUT TO:

               MORE THAN A HUNDRED AGENTS

               Crowded into the now-overflowing BULLPEN. In absolute denial 
               of his physical condition, Hub paces like a caged animal.

                                     HUB
                         -- every trap, every hole. I want to 
                         rumble every mosque, every community 
                         center, every student organization 
                         that's ever said an unkind word. I 
                         want the heat turned up under all 
                         our assets, all our informers, every 
                         snitch gets twisted inside out. And 
                         put some money out on the street -- 
                         Arab community hates these people as 
                         much as we do. They'll help.
                              (turns to Mike)
                         Have you got positive ID on --

                                     MIKE
                         Hub, we don't have positive ID on 
                         anybody.

                                     HUB
                         We need more hands. Fred --

                                     FRED
                         I'm on it.

               He picks up a phone and begins requesting Agent transfers.

                                     HUB
                         I want to talk to Khalil.

                                     TINA
                         He's down the hall.

               Now she picks up a phone and adds to the cacophony.

                                     HUB
                         -- Conferences with DC at 9:00, 12:00, 
                         4:00 and 9:00. Call your families, 
                         find a sleeping bag, nobody leaves 
                         this office until we have a strand 
                         to pull. Oklahoma City, people. The 
                         first twenty-four hours are the only 
                         twenty-four hours.. And I don't want 
                         to see anybody walking.

               TEN MINUTES LATER - OUTSIDE A HOLDING CELL

               Hub and Frank watch Khalil through a VIDEO MONITOR. The 
               bruises on Khalil's face have deepened.

                                     HUB
                         Doctor seen him?

                                     TINA
                         He's on his way up.

                                     HUB
                         Got a cigarette --?

                                     TINA
                         You don't smoke.

               Hub pockets the pack of cigarettes and walks into:

               THE CELL

               Frank hangs back in the doorway. Hub pulls up a chair, turns 
               it backwards, and sits down very close to Khalil.

                                     HUB
                         Ten thousand dollars.

               Frank translates. Khalil pretends not to understand.

                                     HUB
                         Khalil. I want to talk about the 
                         money.

               Again Frank translates. And again, Khalil looks blank.

                                     HUB
                         Okay...

               Hub reaches into his pocket and casually takes out the pack 
               of cigarettes. Khalil's eyes widen. Hub smiles at him. At 
               the SOUND of the match lighting, SWEAT begins to bead on 
               Khalil's forehead. Hub takes his time LIGHTING the cigarette -- 
               drawing deep so the tip turns bright red. Khalil unconsciously 
               RECOILS in his chair.

                                     HUB
                              (to Frank, re: Khalil)
                         Doesn't like second hand smoke.

               Hub turns back to Khalil, casually gesturing with his 
               cigarette. Khalil almost jumps out of his skin.

                                     HUB
                         You ready to talk about money?

               Frank hasn't even begun to translate before Khalil begins 
               SPEED-RAPPING in Arabic.

                                     FRANK
                              (translating)
                         ...He says he loves America and only 
                         wanted to get away from the security 
                         services at home.

               Tears stream down Khalil's face. He kneels at Hub's feet.

                                     FRANK
                              (still translating)
                         ...He says he's sorry but he didn't 
                         know he was doing something bad. His 
                         cousin introduced him to a man who 
                         promised him two hundred dollars for 
                         his dowry if he'd bring the suitcase 
                         to an address in Brooklyn.
                              (to Hub)
                         He's a cut-out.

               OUTSIDE THE ROOM -- LATER

               Hub hands Tina back the pack of cigarettes.

                                     HUB
                         Nasty habit.
                              (to Danny)
                         3830 Flatbush Avenue.

               FLASH CUT -- A SWAT TEAM

               Bursts into an empty apartment. On the floor, a fax machine 
               continuously sending the message: "RELEASE HIM."

               BACK TO -- HUB

                                     HUB
                         We want every rental agreement from 
                         every landlord in Brooklyn. Hotels, 
                         motels, flophouses...
                              (to the other agents)
                         It's cash, guys. They're the only 
                         ones in America using cash.

               TWO HOURS LATER --

               The room is dark. A TECHNICIAN operates an overhead PROJECTOR.

                                     TECHNICIAN
                         This is a spectograph of the semtex 
                         used in the bomb. Look at the benzene

                         unambivalent smokers.
                              (shakes his head)
                         Monsters. The toughest motherfucker 
                         in Bed-Stuy is a muffin compared to 
                         some of these guys.

               They watch as SAMIR gets his bill from the waiter.

                                     FRANK
                         His name's Samir Nazhde. Teaches 
                         Arab Studies at Brooklyn College. He 
                         sponsored Ail Waziri's student visa. 
                         And dig this -- his brother blew up 
                         a movie theatre in Tel Aviv.

                                     ELISE
                         You might consider leaving him alone.

                                     HUB
                         Why would I consider doing that --?

               In the cafe, Samir counts cash to leave on the table.

                                     ELISE
                         Play him like a cop and haul him in 
                         now and get your arrest, or tag him 
                         and let him lead you to the really 
                         big fish.

                                     FRANK
                              (an arabic curse)
                         You're fishing and he's getting visas 
                         for bombers.

                                     ELISE
                         You ever heard of catch and release?

                                     FRANK
                         Yes, and he's on the next plane for 
                         Tunis.

               Hub looks at Elise. Samir is leaving -- it's now or never.

                                     HUB
                         Take him down.

                                     FRANK
                              (keys his radio)
                         Go.

               THREE AGENTS brace Samir politely but firmly, and lead him 
               to their car. Samir slides into the back seat next to Elise. 
               In the REARVIEW MIRROR, Hub watches as a look seems to pass 
               between them. Then again, it may not have happened.

                                     FRANK
                         Samir Nazhde, my name is Frank Haddad, 
                         I'm a Federal Agent. We have reason 
                         to believe you are an accessory to 
                         the bombing of Bus 87.

                                     SAMIR
                         Are you crazy --?

                                     FRANK
                         You are an associate of Ali Waziri.

                                     SAMIR
                         Who? I know no one by that name.

               Elise is looking out the window, seemingly oblivious.

                                     FRANK
                         You got him a student visa.

                                     SAMIR
                         I sign these applications as a matter 
                         of course, hundreds of them. Everyone 
                         wants to come to the land of 
                         opportunity and Baywatch.

               Elise tries to keep a smile off her face. Hub clocks this.

                                     FRANK
                         You spent two years in Israeli jails 
                         during the Intifada.

                                     SAMIR
                         The only ones who didn't were women 
                         like you.

               Frank BACKHANDS him across the mouth. Samir says something 
               in Arabic to Frank, who responds in kind.

                                     HUB
                         Frank --

                                     FRANK
                         Sorry. Family matter.
                              (to Samir)
                         You're going downtown, my friend.

                                     SAMIR
                         You cannot hold me. I know my rights. 
                         I watch American television.

                                     FRANK
                         Defrauding the INS is a Federal 
                         Offense.
                              (hands Samir to waiting 
                              agents)
                         Reservation for one, please.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CTF HEADQUARTERS - LATER

               They enter the BULLPEN. It's well past midnight. People are 
               sacked-out in sleeping bags while others continue working.

                                     ELISE
                         Club Fed.

               Frank leans over Danny Sussman, who has fallen asleep, face 
               down on his desk, and sings in a lovely brogue:

                                     FRANK
                              (singing)
                         "Oh, Danny-boy, the perps, the perps, 
                         are call-ing...
                              (as he awakens)
                         We need a search warrant on Samir...

                                     HUB
                         Frank, c'mere a sec. I want to show 
                         you something.

               He leads Frank into another CUBICLE. Perched on nearby desk, 
               Elise is dialing a phone, she stops to watch them:

                                     HUB
                              (quietly)
                         Frank, you ever hit a prisoner again 
                         I'll have your badge.

                                     FRANK
                         -- Someday I will tell you what those 
                         people did to my village in '71.

               Hub waits for him to calm down.

                                     HUB
                              (touches his arm)
                         Okay. But right now, act as if I'm 
                         capable of saying something funny... 
                         Now, let's go see about that warrant.

               As they walk back, Hub says to Danny:

                                     HUB
                         Find me a Judge who'll play ball 
                         this time. And set up a polygraph 
                         for Samir.

                                     ELISE
                         I still don't understand why we're 
                         tipping our hand with him --

                                     FRANK
                         What's there to tip?

                                     HUB
                         You're just trying to protect your 
                         asset.
                              (to Elise, pointedly:)
                         Aren't you, Elise --? He's your Joe, 
                         your asset. He's working for you, 
                         you're his case officer -- right?

               How should she respond? How thin should she slice it?

                                     ELISE
                         ...Sometimes... in addition to being 
                         a nationality, being a Palestinian 
                         is also a... profession. A lucrative 
                         one.

                                     HUB
                         Meaning, he's your Joe.

                                     ELISE
                         Mine. Yours. The Israelis. The Saudis. 
                         At one time or another, everybody in 
                         the Middle East has slept with 
                         everybody else.

                                     FRANK
                         So you're saying... you sleep around?

                                     ELISE
                         Only professionally.

                                     HUB
                         So we share him.

                                     ELISE
                         No.

                         start deportation proceedings.

                         I can't let you do that.

                                     HUB
                         Oh, you can't let me do that. What 
                         precisely is your involvement with 
                         these people.

                                     ELISE
                              (sighs, then:)
                         Samir's been a very important... 
                         project of mine for some time... I'm 
                         the only one he'll deal with. He's 
                         very well-connected -- and extremely 
                         high-strung.

                                     HUB
                         ...Call the judge.

                              (looks at Frank)
                         How easy is it to get inside, Frank? 
                         How good are your sources in the 
                         mosques? How many people you got in 
                         Hamas --?

               Franks shakes his head, ruefully. She's right.

                                     ELISE
                         No surveillance. I've seen your deft 
                         touch.

                         And I get to see the transcripts.

                                     HUB
                         Fair enough.

                         And I run him.

                                     HUB
                         We share him.

                         He can't know we're talking.

                                     HUB
                         Then don't tell him.

                         Done.

                                     HUB
                              (to Frank)
                         Let him fly.
                              (back to her)
                         But we better start seeing product.

               She nods. A deal. For now.

                                     HUB
                         Any more surprises for me?

                                     ELISE
                         Not tonight.

                                     HUB
                         Then I'm going home to get some 
                         things.

                                     FRANK
                         I'll have somebody drive you.

                                     HUB
                         I'll grab a cab.

               And he's gone. Frank turns to Elise:

                                     FRANK
                         Elise. I'm really high strung, too.

               She just smiles and walks away.

               OUTSIDE THE FEDERAL BUILDING -- MOMENTS LATER

               Not many people around. Hub stands on the corner. A TAXI 
               cruises up. On duty. Available. He slows long enough to see 
               that Hub is black and passes right by.

               AT A RED LIGHT

               The taxi driver stops just long enough for Hub to slam his 
               SHIELD on the windshield.

               IN THE TAXI

               Hub sits in back, hurtling into the night. The driver's ID 
               identifies him as ABDUL HASSAM. Hub shakes his head.

               IN THE SHOWER

               As the hot SPRAY hits him, he runs his hands through his 
               hair and feels the BITS OF SHATTERED GLASS. Dried blood runs 
               off in rivulets from his hands. Not his own. He leans against 
               the shower wall, closes his eyes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ELISE -- BRUTALLY SLAPPED ACROSS THE FACE

               We are in her apartment. Samir looms over her.

                                     SAMIR
                         You let him HIT ME --!! You cannot 
                         care about me and let such things 
                         happen!

                                     ELISE
                         Next time don't be such a smart ass --

                                     SAMIR
                         Sometimes I hate you just because 
                         you are so American. It makes me 
                         want to hurt you. I think about 
                         fucking you and hurting you.

               Elise can taste the blood in her mouth -- but it's the price 
               she's come to accept. In a heartbeat, it's all business.

                                     ELISE
                         -- You want to fuck me? Then work 
                         with me.

                                     SAMIR
                         Don't tell me what I have to do.

                                     ELISE
                         No? Do we really want to have this 
                         conversation again? Do we --?

               Something quietly ominous in her tone. He lowers his eyes. 
               And like a sailboat, Elise changes tack. Strokes his arm.

                                     ELISE
                         I need you to help me. I need you to 
                         be strong. As you have always been 
                         strong. For both of us. -- Samir? 
                         Look at me...

               BACK TO HUB -- WHO AWAKENS IN THE DARKNESS

               He's fallen asleep in a chair. In his lap is a pile of visa 
               applications. His BEEPER goes off. He rouses himself.

               BACK TO ELISE -- ROUGHLY TURNED OVER IN BED BY SAMIR

               Sex without any shred of tenderness. As Samir kisses the 
               back of her neck, we SEE in her eyes the thousand-yard stare.

               BACK TO HUB -- ON THE STREET

               In the doorway of an apartment building, Frank hands Hub a 
               styrofoam cup of coffee. It's a ritual between them.

               BACK TO ELISE -- LYING IN BED AS SAMIR SMOKES

                                     SAMIR
                         -- Some people just cannot live in 
                         the camps. For my brother, it was 
                         already like dying. The only thing 
                         he lives for is movies.

               He sits up in bed, reaching for another cigarette.

                                     SAMIR
                         -- And then some sheik tells him 
                         that, to die for Allah is beautiful. 
                         If he does this thing, our parents 
                         will be taken care of, and he will 
                         live on in Paradise with seventy 
                         virgins. Seventy.
                              (sighs)
                         And my brother, he needs to believe 
                         it very much, so he straps ten sticks 
                         of dynamite to his chest and goes to 
                         the movies...
                              (a rueful laugh)
                         And I become a VIP. It is very 
                         confusing.

                                     ELISE
                         -- So who are you afraid of betraying? 
                         You know these people. They bomb, 
                         they maim. Do they represent the 
                         Palestine you want to build?
                              (looks at him)
                         They're using you.

                                     SAMIR
                         You are using me, too! Everybody 
                         uses the Palestinians! We are the 
                         whores of the Middle East!
                              (looks at her)
                         You make reports about our little 
                         talks --? What about fucking me?

                                     ELISE
                         I had to get special permission for 
                         that.

               As he stands up, naked, and goes to the window, we SEE:

               THE SAME IMAGE

               Seen again, FROM MUCH FARTHER AWAY by Hub who stands on a 
               ROOFTOP across the way, watching through 10×50 BINOCULARS. 
               Frank stands beside him.

                                     FRANK
                         Beats cable.

               THE FEDERAL BUILDING -- NEXT MORNING

               Hub heads for his office, his SECRETARY nods inside. Someone 
               is waiting. It's Devereaux, in a civilian suit.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Hi. I understand they call you Hub.

                                     HUB
                         I know who you are, General.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                              (offering his hand)
                         Bill Devereaux.

                                     HUB
                         I served in the --

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         82nd Airborne, I know. Same time I 
                         was running the --

                                     HUB
                         -- 173rd. Put me through school.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         God. Duty. Honor. Country. Where on 
                         Capitol Hill, Wall Street, or 
                         Hollywood would you find one man 
                         who's even paused over one of those 
                         words in the last ten years?

               Hub is unsure why he's audience to such a command performance.

                                     HUB
                         What, uh, brings you here, General?... 
                         Can I get you some coffee?

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         You want me to get to the point. The 
                         President's concerned. He's worried 
                         that -- have you met him by any 
                         chance?

                                     HUB
                         No, sir, I haven't. I know -- reading 
                         the papers -- terrorism's a real 
                         concern for him. And your job is to --

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         -- With all the affection for the 
                         man I can tell you he doesn't know 
                         fuckall about terrorism, or the 
                         Mideast, that I don't put on his cue 
                         cards. What he's expert in is his 
                         own survival. You get my meaning?

                                     HUB
                         I didn't guess you came all this way 
                         for a cup of coffee.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Agent Hubbard -- you look like you 
                         think I'm here to take your baby 
                         away!

                                     HUB
                         With all respect for your expertise, 
                         sir. We're on track here.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Which is what I said to the President -- 
                         the Army is not some big green police 
                         department. Stick with the man on 
                         the ground.

                                     HUB
                         I appreciate your support.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         You're sure you're not chasing your 
                         own tail, though?

               Hub considers for a moment, then:

                                     HUB
                         What do you know about Sheik Ahmed 
                         Bin Talal?

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Old news.

                                     HUB
                         Maybe not. We've received two 
                         communications -- from the bombers 
                         to "Release Him."

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         We can't release him.

                                     HUB
                         I know our stated policy is not to 
                         negotiate with terrorists, but --

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Hub, we can't release him because we 
                         don't have him. We never had him. 
                         And besides that, he's dead.

                                     HUB
                         The CIA says --

                         The CIA? The CIA couldn't predict 
                         the fall of the Berlin Wall until 
                         bricks were hitting them in the head.

                         some sectarian Muslim thing -- I'll 
                         explain it next time you have a free 
                         week. They killed him. Qaddafi put 
                         out disinformation that it was us...

                         Elise Kraft can't tell a Sheik from

                         I appreciate the heads up.

               Devereaux rises, offers his hand. As they shake, Elise sticks 
               her head in the door without knocking.

                              around)
                         Oh. Hello, General.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Please, don't let me --

                              (to Hub)
                         Sorry. That tip on the landlord looks 
                         solid. The judge will see us right 
                         away.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Sounds like I should get out of your 
                         way. We're there if you need us.
                              (at the door; to Elise)
                         Your father well, Elise?

                         As can be expected. How's Maggie?

                         Top of her game.
                              (heads out)
                         Well, go get 'em.

               And he's gone. Elise turns to Hub.

                         It's a full contact sport.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               JUDGE'S CHAMBERS -- DOWNTOWN

               Judge Frankel, 60, puts down his sandwich and wipes his hands.

                                     JUDGE FRANKEL
                         -- You're telling me that just because 
                         some Brooklyn landlord tips you off 
                         that he's been paid in cash, you 
                         have the right to call in the cavalry --
                         ! Hub, as far as I know, paying cash 
                         is not yet a crime in this country.

                                     HUB
                         You're not hearing me. This Khalil 
                         was carrying cash for --

                                     JUDGE FRANKEL
                         -- You've observed him giving cash 
                         to --

                                     HUB
                         ... No, but --

                                     JUDGE FRANKEL
                         -- But you have hard evidence linking 
                         this apartment to the people that 
                         blew up bus 87 --?

               Elise sits quietly beside Frank, observing Hub's trials.

                                     HUB
                         I know we'll turn up trace elements 
                         of semtex, chemicals... something.

                                     JUDGE FRANKEL
                         And when you do, you'll get your 
                         warrant.

                                     HUB
                         What about as a feasibility study?

                                     JUDGE FRANKEL
                         Meaning?

                                     HUB
                         We enter first, take a look, then 
                         fill out the warrant.

                                     JUDGE FRANKEL
                         Tell me the difference between that 
                         and breaking-and-entering?

                                     HUB
                         We're the good guys.

                                     JUDGE FRANKEL
                         Not good enough.

                                     HUB
                         What is good enough, Judge? Another 
                         bus? A school, maybe. These things 
                         come in waves.

                                     JUDGE FRANKEL
                         Waves mean nothing to me; there's 
                         been a wave of violent crime committed 
                         by black people in this city for the 
                         past twenty years, but if you came 
                         to me with a plan to put all black 
                         people behind bars as a preventative 
                         measure I'd send you packing. There's 
                         a price to be paid for living in a 
                         free society --

                                     HUB
                         -- and not in cash I guarantee it.

               Hub catches Elise's eye -- "we're out of here."

               THE STAIRCASE OF A TENEMENT

               Elise and Hub climb seemingly endless FLIGHTS OF STAIRS.

                                     ELISE
                         -- Not two Judges from now, not two 
                         HOURS from now, not two MINUTES from 
                         now. These guys could split any SECOND 
                         and you've lost your best shot at --

                                     HUB
                         Frank's working another warrant --

                                     ELISE
                         You don't understand, they're pros! 
                         From the age of twelve they've been 
                         dodging people like you, people better 
                         than you.

                                     HUB
                         You mean people like you?

                                     ELISE
                         -- no matter how sparkling your record 
                         is, no matter how terrified you are 
                         to fail --

               Finally he stops, turns on her:

                                     HUB
                         It's... against... the... law.

                         -- Just because you went to night 
                         school, or filled out the back of a 
                         matchbook or whatever you did to get 
                         a law degree doesn't make you Sir 
                         Thomas More.

                                     HUB
                         Just because you talk the talk doesn't 
                         make you an expert. And just because 
                         you read my file doesn't make you an 
                         expert on me.

                                     ELISE
                         You're gonna lose them and they're 
                         gonna do another horrible --

                                     HUB
                         -- You think I want to lose them. 
                         Where do you get off talking that 
                         shit.
                              (controls himself...)
                         If I don't take 'em down properly 
                         they'll be on the street two hours 
                         from now. I could find dynamite, 
                         semtex, plutonium and a book of 
                         matches in there and unless I've got 
                         the right warrant it's all 
                         inadmissible

                                     ELISE
                         They've also got a warrant. A warrant 
                         from God. They're ready to die! And 
                         your quaint laws don't mean shit to 
                         these people.

                                     HUB
                         My quaint laws? Last I checked you 
                         were an American citizen. And these 
                         happen to be the only laws we got.
                              (turns on her)
                         Look, I'm just a cop, okay, and I'm 
                         real sorry the cold war's over, and 
                         you Masters of the Universe got 
                         nothing going on over there in 
                         Afghanistan or Iraq or wherever -- 
                         but you're just not in the Middle 
                         East anymore...

                                     ELISE
                         Oh, really...?

               They reach the top of the stairs where Frank is waiting. He 
               dangles a piece of paper -- the warrant -- and grins.

               IN THE SAME SQUALID APARTMENT BUILDING -- LATER

               Hub looks through the surveillance equipment focused on an 
               apartment across the street -- paper shades drawn. Wearing a 
               set of HEADPHONES, Elise listens intently to the Arabic 
               conversation.

                                     ELISE
                         They're discussing how hard it is to 
                         find a decent cup of coffee over 
                         here.
                              (hands headset to 
                              Frank)
                         I make out three voices. What do you 
                         have on the infrared?

                                     FRANK
                         Three sounds right. If we had 
                         microwave we'd know for sure. The 
                         CIA's got microwave, how come we 
                         don't have microwave.

               Hub, meanwhile is question a Syrian Landlord.

                                     LANDLORD
                         -- three of them. All day long they 
                         watch tv. And eat pizza. Nothing but 
                         pizza, pizza, pizza...

               Hub looks over at Frank. They've got a way in.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DARK HALLWAY -- DAY

               Mike Johannson, carrying two PIZZAS, knocks on a door.

               IN THE SHADOWS BELOW

               Hub, Frank, and a small army of AGENTS lock and load.

               A YOUNG ARAB

               Opens the door to the length of a chain and hands Mike a 
               twenty-dollar bill.

                                     MIKE
                         You want change, right --?

                                     YOUNG ARAB
                         No.

                                     MIKE
                         You gonna open the door, or what --?

               The Arab motions, leave them on the ground.

                                     MIKE
                         Jesus, didn't ya hear crime's down 
                         seven-percent...

               Muttering, he sets the pizza down and heads downstairs. After 
               a moment we HEAR the chain pulled and the door open.

               IN THE APARTMENT

               The Young Arab sets the pizza on an orange crate. Two other 
               YOUNG ARABS in the next room barely take their eyes off the 
               rerun of "Hunter." But as the young Arab opens the box:

               A STUN GRENADE

               Hidden within, EXPLODES with a blinding FLASH, knocking him 
               to the ground.

               THE APARTMENT DOOR

               Is blown in as armed AGENTS rush in, Hub leading the way.

                                     FBI AGENTS
                              (English and Arabic)
                         FBI --! Lie down on the floor with 
                         your hands behind your back --!

               THE TWO OTHER YOUNG ARABS, HOWEVER --

               Have not been affected. Not only were they in the next room, 
               but also their eyes were averted from the FLASH.

               THEY COME UP FIRING

               But only get off half a clip each before they are CUT DOWN 
               by a fusillade of FBI return-fire.

               ON THE GROUND

               The Young Arab, momentarily disoriented, stumbles to his 
               feet, only to be confronted by six armed agents -- all aiming 
               at his chest.

                                     FRANK
                         Drop your weapon!

               The terrorist puts his gun to his mouth and PULLS THE TRIGGER.

               A STILLNESS

               As the CORDITE drifts lazily toward the ceiling, Hub calls 
               out from behind the table:

                                     HUB
                         What about the others? See if we can 
                         get a pulse --

               Other Agents scurry in to hover over the inert BODIES.

                                     FRED
                         Terminal.

                                     MIKE
                         Same here.

                                     ELISE
                              (softly)
                         Gone.

               Hub picks himself up in time to see Elise, kneeling beside 
               the body of the Young Arab, her hand on his boyish chest.

                                     MIKE
                         We got semtex, we got detcord, same 
                         stuff as the bus, the whole 
                         enchilada...

               A few WHOOPS and high-fives as the adrenaline rush of the 
               firefight abates. Frank opens the remaining box.

                                     FRANK
                         Anybody like anchovies --?

               Then from across the room, Hub kneels beside an ominous-
               looking DEVICE. A claymore mine.

                                     HUB
                         Goddamn it. GODDAMN IT.

                                     FRANK
                         What --?

                                     HUB
                         It didn't fire. They had it rigged 
                         to the door and it didn't fire.

               Frank stares at the lethal booby-trap. Hub shakes his head.

                                     HUB
                         We're too old to be lucky, Frank.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A DOWNTOWN BAR -- LATER THAT NIGHT

               Where Mike and Tina are dancing their asses off. Around them, 
               other AGENTS from the takedown laugh and drink.

               AT A NEARBY TABLE

               Hub and Elise sit, watch them cut loose.

                                     ELISE
                              (sips her drink)
                         My first boyfriend was Palestinian. 
                         My father liked to say, they seduce 
                         you with their suffering.

               A WAITRESS brings her another drink.

                                     ELISE
                         You ever been over there --?
                              (he shakes his head, 
                              no)
                         ...The courtesy with which they 
                         welcome you into their homes. And 
                         the people, these incredibly... warm 
                         people in this... austere land.

                                     HUB
                         But you work against them.

                                     ELISE
                         Only the crazies. I tend to be 
                         suspicious of all true believers.
                              (looks at him)
                         Present company included.

                                     HUB
                         So I'm a fanatic.

                                     ELISE
                         Let's just say you don't seem the 
                         ambivalent type.

                                     HUB
                         Is that right?

                                     ELISE
                         So why're are you a fed?

                                     HUB
                         That's what my nephew keeps asking 
                         me. "Why you with The Man, Unc?"

                                     ELISE
                         ...Well? What'd you tell him?

                                     HUB
                         You read my file. You tell me.

                                     ELISE
                         Let's see... Catholic school. Captain 
                         of this, president of that. Hard 
                         work, fair play, make a difference, 
                         change the system from within. Rah. 
                         Rah. Rah.

                                     HUB
                         That was in my file?

                                     ELISE
                         ...Tell me I'm wrong.

               He studies her for a moment.

                                     ELISE
                         ...What --?

                                     HUB
                         You believe in anything, Elise --?

                                     ELISE
                         Like what, for instance?

                                     HUB
                         How about right and wrong?

                                     ELISE
                         It's easy to choose between right 
                         and wrong. What's hard is choosing 
                         the wrong that's more right. I just 
                         want to make it all... a little... 
                         better.
                              (finishes her drink)
                         Ignore me. I'm shitfaced.

               Frank appears to lean over their table.

                                     FRANK
                         So am I --! Hey, Elise... tell us 
                         about being a spook? Ever meet Aldrich 
                         Ames? Weren't you at the Bay of Pigs?

                                     ELISE
                         You were in charge of Waco, right --
                         ? Or was that Ruby Ridge?

                                     FRANK
                         The Shah of Iran, Noriega, I love 
                         the way you guys predicted the 
                         collapse of the Soviet Union.

                                     ELISE
                         Yeah, yeah, yeah... And J. Edgar 
                         Hoover wore a dress.

               She laughs and stands up to dance:

                                     ELISE
                         What do you say, Hub...? Peace?

               But as he grudgingly stands up, a BALLAD comes on. They stand 
               there awkwardly. Finally, he takes her into his arms.

                                     ELISE
                         This feels like high school.

                                     HUB
                         -- only my prom date wasn't packing 
                         a gun.

                                     ELISE
                         Mine's a 9 mm. How big is yours?

                                     HUB
                         Two inches. From the ground.
                              (laughing, they dance 
                              closer)
                         So what's the latest from Samir. I 
                         want a list of every visa he 
                         sponsored.

                                     ELISE
                         Not sure he'll do it.

                                     HUB
                         I once knew this undercover guy, 
                         started to care so much about his 
                         source --

                                     ELISE
                         -- Samir's a source. Period.

                                     HUB
                         Have you considered that he might 
                         also be in bed with the other side?

                                     ELISE
                         Samir in bed with them? That would 
                         too much to wish for.

                                     HUB
                         You're so confident.

                                     ELISE
                         Only in bed.

               Tina watches them. She rolls her eyes at Frank. And then:

               THE GROUND SHAKES

               A low RUMBLE as the light FLICKERS and the chandelier sways.

                                     FRANK
                         Whoa... What do they put in these 
                         drinks --?

                                     TINA
                         They got earthquakes in Manhattan?

               But Elise is not too drunk to make her way to the door. Hub 
               joins her. Already, in the distance, the WAILING OF SIRENS.

               IN THE TOWN CAR -- SPEEDING UPTOWN ON MADISON AVE

               Blue light FLASHING. Hub, Elise and Frank sit grimly silent.

               TRAFFIC

               Is snarled and gridlocked at 40th. Finally, they can take it 
               no longer and step out into a chorus of HONKING HORNS.

               THEY BEGIN TO RUN

               Past the frustrated drivers. Turning the corner at 41st where:

               SMOKE BILLOWS

               From the New Victory Theatre -- where a gala benefit is taking 
               place.

               GIRL IN A PRADA GOWN

               Walks toward CAMERA. She's stunning. From the jeweled 
               clutchbag to the tasteful necklace, everything is perfect, 
               except:

               HER RIGHT ARM IS MISSING

               And now we SEE:

               THE BLACK-AND-WHITES

               Haphazardly pulled-up over the steps and the FIRETRUCKS 
               already unspooling their hoses. Cops, Firemen, EMT's. 
               Everybody's SCREAMING. Hub and Elise race past.

               MAN IN BLACK TIE

               Sits, weeping quietly beneath the once proud stone lions.

               THE FEW SURVIVORS

               Their faces cut and bleeding, stumble around, disoriented. 
               As Hub and Elise continue toward a SOUND we have never heard 
               before in this country. A kind of keening.

               A NYPD SERGEANT is the senior OFFICER on the scene. Hub shows 
               his shield to the man who appears a bit shell-shocked.

                                     NYPD SERGEANT
                         -- fucking bastards waited 'til 
                         intermission. Everybody standing 
                         around... Oh, Jesus...

               GLASS crunching underfoot, they can only watch as horribly 
               disfigured BODIES are carried out. A NEWS REPORTER shoves a 
               microphone in Hub's face.

                                     NEWS REPORTER
                         Is it true the governor was attending 
                         tonight's benefit --?

                                     HUB
                         I don't know.

                                     NEWS REPORTER
                         Who it is I'm speaking to --?

               Hub ignores the reporter. He sees that Elise is already 
               tearing off part of her skirt to bandage a SOCIETY MATRON. 
               He takes off his coat and goes to work beside her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A DARKENED AIRPLANE

               Hub sits alone.

                                     PILOT (O.S.)
                         Folks, as you can probably tell, we 
                         have begun our descent into 
                         Washington's National airport.

               THE HIGH-PITCHED WHISTLING SOUND IS HEARD AGAIN

               Hub reaches up to his DAMAGED EARS. As anyone who's ever 
               flown with a sinus problem knows, the pain is excruciating.

                                     STEWARDESS
                         -- You alright?

               But we can only LIP-READ her question. He's sweating now. 
               Over this, we HEAR:

                                     ARMY GENERAL (V.O.)
                         Either we answer this threat quickly 
                         and convincingly or next week there'll 
                         be a hundred more all over the world.

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               ON CAPITOL HILL -- LATER THAT DAY

               As Hub climbs the steps toward the gleaming dome, the debate 
               continues within:

                                     CONGRESSMAN MARSHALL (V.O.)
                         Sounds great, General, except why 
                         can't we find out who's behind it --
                         ?

               IN THE ROTUNDA LIBRARY

               A strategy session chaired by General Devereaux. Sleeves 
               rolled up, silver coffee service. Staff members abound.

                                     FBI DIRECTOR
                         These sects are organized so you 
                         need a kill to your credit to get 
                         inside. It makes undercover operations 
                         impossible. What that leaves us is... 
                         we're working on it.

                                     SENATOR WRIGHT
                         How about who's behind who's behind 
                         this?

                                     CIA DIRECTOR
                         Libya. Iraq. Iran. Possibly Syria.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         Ask a question. Get an atlas.

                                     SENATOR WRIGHT
                         All I know is that we must respond.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         Respond, sure. But how?

                                     SENATOR WRIGHT
                         Find out who it is and bomb the shit 
                         out of them.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         And if we can't find out --?

               The question hangs in the air.

                                     CONGRESSMAN MARSHALL
                         Look it keeps escalating. First a 
                         bus, then the theatre. What's next?

                                     SENATOR WRIGHT
                         Anything but leadership.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         With all respect, Senator, why don't 
                         we just stipulate that the President 
                         is a dumb son of a bitch so we can 
                         all get down to business.

               An icebreaker. Everyone laughs.

                                     CONGRESSMAN MARSHALL (V.O.)
                         What about sending in the Guard?

                                     ATTORNEY GENERAL (V.O.)
                         The National Guard are trained for 
                         riot control not counter-terrorism.

                         The Army then. I've seen the 
                         contingency plans.

                                     ATTORNEY GENERAL
                         It's settled legal doctrine, posse 
                         comitatus, that the Army not be turned 
                         against our own people.

                                     SENATOR WRIGHT
                         Even if that's what our own people 
                         are asking for, three to one?

                                     SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE
                         If the President is willing to declare 
                         a State of Emergency --

                                     SENATOR WRIGHT
                         President Lincoln declared martial 
                         law in 1862. He suspended --

                         -- which the Supreme Court later 
                         found un-constitutional. Ex parte 
                         Milligan.

                                     CONGRESSMAN MARSHALL
                         And I've got an election in November. 
                         Ex-United States Congressman.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         Guys, guys, the President lost a lot 
                         of friends last night --

                                     CONGRESSMAN MARSHALL
                         Not to mention six points in the 
                         polls.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         -- And his plane lands in two hours. 
                         We owe it to him to have a consensus.

                                     SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE
                         You don't fight a junkyard dog with 
                         ASPCA rules. What you do is take the 
                         leash off your own, bigger, meaner 
                         dog.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         ...General?

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         The Army is a broadsword not a 
                         scalpel. You do not want us in an 
                         American city.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         But hypothetically... how long would 
                         it take you to --

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         We only go if the President invokes 
                         the War Powers Act.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         I understand that, General. Let us 
                         imagine, though, for a moment, that 
                         the order has been given.

               CLOSE on Devereaux. As he weighs his remarks, we FLASHCUT, 
               almost imperceptibly to:

               AN ANONYMOUS ROOM

               As WATER is poured over anonymous hands in a ritualized 
               manner. O.S. we HEAR the SOUND of chanting.

               BACK TO -- THE SITUATION ROOM -- SAME TIME

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         ...Twelve hours after the President 
                         gives the word we can be on the 
                         ground. One light infantry division 
                         of ten thousand seven hundred men. 
                         Elements of the Rapid Deployment 
                         Force combined with Special Forces -- 
                         Delta. APC's, tanks, helicopters. 
                         And of course, the ubiquitous M-16A1 
                         assault rifle, a humble weapon until 
                         you see a man carrying one outside 
                         your local bowling alley or Seven-
                         Eleven. It will be noisy, it will be 
                         scary and it will not be mistaken 
                         for a VFW parade.

               BACK TO -- THE ANONYMOUS ROOM

               Where the same anonymous hands lift a cotton shroud. We watch 
               in SLOW-MOTION as it drifts down a shoulder.

               BACK TO -- THE SITUATION ROOM

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         That means civilian casualties. At a 
                         minimum it's a drunk private joyriding 
                         in a Hummer who runs down an old 
                         lady in Greenpoint. At a maximum...
                              (sighs)
                         Make no mistake. We will hunt the 
                         enemy. We will find the enemy. And 
                         we will kill the enemy.

               BACK TO -- THE ANONYMOUS HANDS

               Turning the key in an ignition. An engine rumbles to life.

               BACK TO -- THE SITUATION ROOM

                                     DEVEREAUX
                              (looks at them)
                         And no card-carrying member of the 
                         ACLU is more deadset against it... 
                         than I am. Which is why I urge you... 
                         no, I implore you not to consider 
                         this option.

               A long beat. The Chief of Staff sighs.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         I know what the President will say.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         What's that?

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         That's exactly why you're the only 
                         man for the job.

               BACK TO -- A VAN

               Emerges from a dark garage like a beast from a cave.

               BACK TO -- THE SITUATION ROOM

               The Army General speaks up.

                                     ARMY GENERAL
                         I remind you General Devereaux does 
                         not speak for official Army policy. 
                         A police function has become accepted 
                         as our role in Haiti, in Somalia --

                                     HUB
                         -- Could I interrupt?

               Everyone looks over at Hub. Devereaux smiles.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         That's Anthony Hubbard, FBI. He's 
                         the ASAC on the ground up there. 
                         They took out the first cell less 
                         than 36 hours after bus 87. I suggest 
                         we hear what he has to say --

               He nods to Hub, who acknowledges the vote of confidence.

                                     HUB
                         There is something you probably 
                         haven't thought about doing?

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         And that is --?

                                     HUB
                         Nothing. Don't over-react.
                              (off their incredulity)
                         With all respect, gentlemen, I'm 
                         just a cop. To you these people may 
                         be martyrs, but to me they're 
                         criminals. And a criminal is no more 
                         than somebody who thinks he's better 
                         than everyone else. And he's not 
                         better. He only has to be wrong once. 
                         And that's where we come in. We run 
                         down a tip from a landlord, or we 
                         pick up a latent print from a bus. 
                         Our phones are ringing off the hook 
                         with people from the Arab community 
                         wanting to help.

               He measures his words carefully. Unaccustomed to these kind 
               of august circumstances.

                                     HUB
                         They love this country and they hate 
                         that these criminals are giving them 
                         a bad name. With their help and some 
                         old-fashioned shoe leather, we'll 
                         nail these guys.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         -- Amen to that.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         Thank you, Agent Hubbard. I, too, 
                         think we should proceed cautiously.
                              (looks around)
                         Now we've got an Agency briefing 
                         prepared... Some of you may not know 
                         Sharon Bridger. Sharon was posted in 
                         Iraq as part of our covert operations 
                         during the Gulf War. -- Sharon...

               CLOSE ON -- HUB as, from behind him, comes a familiar VOICE:

                                     ELISE
                         We all know the traditional model of 
                         a terrorist network. One cell 
                         controlling all others. Cut off the 
                         head and the body will wither.

               Hub looks to the back of the room at Elise, who's no longer 
               Elise. She looks blithely at Hub as if nothing is amiss.

                                     ELISE
                         Unfortunately the old wisdom no longer 
                         applies. The new paradigm is like 
                         the myth of the Hydra. Each cell 
                         exists independent of the other. Cut 
                         off one head and another rises up in 
                         its place.

               ANOTHER FLASH CUT -- THE VAN

               Crossing the Brooklyn Bridge, keeping well below the speed 
               limit. In the distance, the glass towers of Manhattan.

               BACK TO -- THE SITUATION ROOM

                                     ELISE
                         Bus 87 was the work of Cell #1. Its 
                         elimination only activated the work 
                         of Cell #2 -- the theatre gala.

               FLASH CUT -- THE VAN

               Turns up Wall Street. Frank Haddad and Danny exit THE FEDERAL 
               BUILDING. They pass Mike and Fred, heading back in. Something 
               about the van causes Frank to take notice.

               BACK TO -- THE SITUATION ROOM

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         And Cell #3? How do we find Cell #3?

               Everyone looks to Sharon/Elise. Hub looks at her, too.

               CLOSE ON -- SHARON/ELISE

               The question hangs in the air. She's thinking about something. 
               What?

               ANOTHER FLASH CUT -- THE VAN

               JUMPS THE CURB and heads across the plaza on A COLLISION 
               COURSE with the glass lobby of the FEDERAL BUILDING. Frank 
               and Danny are rooted to the ground.

               BACK TO -- THE SITUATION ROOM

               Close on Sharon/Elise. As time elongates. She knows.

               WHITE SCREEN (ALL SOUND OUT)

               Puffy clouds in a blue sky. As we TILT DOWN into:

               THE GUTTED RUIN

               Of what was once the Federal Building. RESCUE WORKERS hunt 
               for SURVIVORS as others carry BODY BAGS toward waiting 
               AMBULANCES. Hub stands sentinel to the grisly process as 
               indeed he has stood there all night. Frank is beside him.

                                     HUB
                         -- Are they confirmed?

                         Fred, Whitney, we're waiting on who 
                         else...

               A JEEP pulls up and Elise/Sharon gets out.

                                     HUB
                         Sharon.

               Their silence speaks volumes. With Sharon is an OFFICER.

                         at this point? Your... infrastructure --

                                     HUB
                         You're standing on our infrastructure. 
                         Excuse me.

               Hub walks back toward the rubble. Sharon watches him go.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               HUB'S APARTMENT -- THAT NIGHT

               Sofas have been pushed against the wall. Hub's apartment now 
               serves as a temporary command post. Agents huddle together -- 
               poring over the charred or soggy remnants of files.

                                     FLOYD
                         -- They managed to get a partial 
                         VIN# off the van. DMV says it was 
                         reported stolen the day before in --

                                     HUB
                         -- Brooklyn.

                         Fiber thinks they've come up with a 
                         piece of the shroud. Egyptian cotton.

               Frank joins them.

                                     FRANK
                              (grim)
                         We just got a confirmation on Mike. 
                         He was with Fred in the lobby.

                                     HUB
                         How many does that make it --?

               A KNOCK on the door. They look at one another. One of the 
               agents answers it. Elise/Sharon. She walks over to them.

                                     ELISE
                         I'm... very sorry... about your 
                         friends.

                                     HUB
                              (giving her nothing)
                         Frank. This is Sharon.
                              (to her)
                         -- I didn't catch the last name.

                                     ELISE
                         ...Bridger. How ya doin' Frank?

                                     FRANK
                         Been better.

               She nods. Takes from her purse a folder, labeled in Hebrew.

                                     ELISE
                         The agency has come up with another 
                         list of probables.

               She takes out photos. Neither Hub nor Frank react. She puts 
               them on the coffee table. No one reaches for them.

                                     ELISE
                         I think we should circulate them.
                              (they stonewall her:)
                         Hey, this stuff may be good.

                                     HUB
                         Why was there no warning from Samir?

                                     ELISE
                         Because he didn't know anything.

                                     FRANK
                         Says Samir.

                                     ELISE
                         Says me.

                                     HUB
                         Maybe I'll ask him.

                                     ELISE
                         Over my dead body.

                                     HUB
                         Over six hundred dead bodies.

               They stare at one another. Both are tired and raw.

                                     ELISE
                         Look, he's one of the good guys. 
                         Okay?

                                     HUB
                         How the fuck can you be so sure?

                                     ELISE
                         Because he helped me recruit the 
                         network in Iraq. OKAY?

               He just stares at her.

                                     ELISE
                         We were part of the operation to 
                         destabilize Saddam Hussein. Printing 
                         up fake dinars, arming the Kurds --

                                     HUB
                         -- and financing the Sheik.

                                     ELISE
                         He's Iraqi. He was going to be our 
                         Ayatollah Khomeini --

                         -- And help bring down Saddam.

                                     ELISE
                         I ran the network. Samir was the go-
                         between. He risked his life for us 
                         over there.

                                     HUB
                         So who are they? Give me names, Give 
                         me pictures. Not some history lesson.

                                     ELISE
                         I can't give you pictures because I 
                         don't know what they look like. We 
                         did everything at arm's length.

                                     HUB
                         So you got nothing.

                                     ELISE
                         I've got Samir.

                                     HUB
                         Has he had any contact with them?

                                     ELISE

                                     ELISE
                         He can't. They initiate.

                                     HUB
                         And otherwise...

                         He's waiting.

                                     HUB
                         He's waiting? What's he waiting for? 
                         More bodies? We got lots more 
                         buildings in midtown, maybe he's 
                         waiting to see how many they can 
                         blow up.

                         How?... Why soon?

               She looks at him, refusing to divulge anything more. Suddenly, 
               Hub grabs her arm and roughly shoves her into:

               THE BATHROOM

                                     HUB
                              (viciously)
                         What's the tradecraft, Sharon? 
                         Ironsites, visuals? I love all that 
                         spy shit.
                              (still, she says 
                              nothing)
                         I'm gonna haul your boy downtown, 
                         strap his ass to a polygraph and ask 
                         him all about you. Then I'm gonna 
                         send the transcripts to a friend of 
                         mine at the Times who just loves to 
                         write about the latest CIA link to 
                         some political horror show.

                                     ELISE
                         You burn him, you lose any chance 
                         you ever had.

                                     HUB
                         It's lose-lose from here on in, who 
                         said that?

                                     ELISE
                         I'm not fucking with you.

                                     HUB
                         How can you possibly remember who 
                         you're fucking?

               She slaps him, hard. Without hesitation he slaps her back. 
               She claws at his face, but he grabs her wrist and bends her 
               arm behind her back.

                                     ELISE
                         I need... more time. Please. You're 
                         hurting me. Please...

               Something in the violence of the moment is more than a little 
               charged.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Today, as hundreds of law enforcement 
                         officials gathered in a Broadway 
                         theatre, outside people wanted 
                         answers.

               Angry people, scared people. Hub, being interviewed about 
               the coordinated efforts of law enforcement.

                         Already there is talk of a protest

               Hub and a few others sit on the stage. Two hundred law 
               enforcement officials fill the orchestra seats.

               Sharon stands at the back, meets Hub's eye, and waves.

                         Guys... GUYS...

               EVERYBODY'S talking at once. In frustration, Hub covers a 
               microphone with his hand. The FEEDBACK silences the room.

                                     HUB
                         Sorry. From now on, we will raise 
                         our hands and wait to be called on --

               An appreciative chuckle. Hub points to A MAN IN A SUIT.

                         injustices my people may be suffering

                         continue to show our patriotism and 
                         our commitment to this country.

                                     HUB
                         Thank you, sir. And to everyone else 
                         for their patience today. These are 
                         extremely difficult times -- London,

                         have to deal with this.

               He pauses a moment, searching for the words.

                                     HUB
                         In Tel Aviv, the day after they blew 
                         up the market, the market was full.
                              (looks out at them)
                         This is New York. We can take it.

               And then two hundred BEEPERS all go off at once. Everyone 
               looks at one another. Dear God, what now...

               A GRAINY BLACK & WHITE VIDEO IMAGE

               Kids, huddled in a corner, crying. A dead mom. The legs of 
               what we imagine is the terrorist. We are in:

               AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL -- AN UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

               Hub huddles with other agents behind a makeshift blast-
               barricade of desks and tables. Sharon kneels beside them.

                                     DANNY
                         -- one of the moms was carrying a 
                         piece, wounds the guy as he's planting 
                         the device. He kills her and locks 
                         them all in.
                              (points at video)
                         Up there in the corner... by the 
                         clock.

               The probe is a hot-head, "arthroscopic" video camera.

                                     DANNY
                         -- It's got a timer on it only we 
                         don't know how much time is left.

               As Hub stares at the horrifying image, the WHITE-NOISE returns 
               and begins to GROW in his head.

                                     HUB
                         Closer on the timer.

                                     TECHNICIAN
                         I'm trying but the angle's wrong...

               The NOISE in Hub's head continues to grow. And then suddenly 
               it is compounded by the SOUND of an APPROACHING CHOPPER -- 
               as an NYPD SWAT HELICOPTER lowers itself into view.

                                     FRANK
                         What the fuck is the NYPD doing here?!

                                     DANNY
                         I don't know. Somebody must have --

                                     FRANK
                         -- WE'VE RUN DRILLS ON THIS 
                         JURISDICTION BULLSHIT SINCE --

                                     DANNY
                         I KNOW --! YOU THINK I --

                                     HUB
                         QUIT BICKERING AND FIX IT!

               In the HELICOPTER -- a Marksman raises a sniper's rifle.

               THE WHITE NOISE

               Is screaming now in Hub's head. Unimaginable. Unbearable.

                                     DANNY
                              (on his radio)
                         NYPD SWAT, this is the FBI. Get that 
                         bird the fuck out of there!

               The SOUND of the CHOPPER and the WHITE NOISE drown him out.

               ON THE VIDEO MONITOR

               Children are SCREAMING without sound. Even the chopper is 
               drowned out by the WHITE NOISE.

               IN THE CHOPPER

               The MARKSMAN takes careful aim --

               IN THE CLASSROOM

               The TERRORIST grabs a child as a human shield. Hub closes 
               his eyes to the imminent nightmare, and then:

               SUDDENLY, WITHOUT WARNING --

               He takes off, barreling down the hall, toward the locked 
               door of the classroom.

               THE DOOR SPLINTERS

               He flies through it, firing, hitting the TERRORIST twice.

               AN EXPLOSION

               Much like the first one on Bus 99. Hub throws himself over 
               several SCREAMING CHILDREN. And for a moment we don't know 
               if they'll live or die, until:

               BLUE PAINT covers them all. Agents pour in, followed by 
               Sharon. There, on the floor, holding as many weeping children 
               as he can:

               HUB

               Who, unable to keep up the facade for a single second more, 
               is also weeping now. Weeping for the victims of the bombings, 
               weeping for the children who've survived, weeping for himself.

               And for a moment, everyone just... stands there, vaguely 
               embarrassed, and more than a little moved.

               INT. HUB'S APARTMENT - THAT NIGHT

               Hub sits in his boxers, toweling blue paint from his hair, 
               listening to the CNN report of the school attack. A KNOCK at 
               the door. He pulls on his pants. It's Sharon.

                                     ELISE
                         This just came in.

               She hands Hub another fax: "Last Warning. Release Him." He 
               looks at it and hands it back to her without a word.

                                     ELISE
                         You alright?

                                     HUB
                         My neck's a little stiff, that's 
                         all.

                                     ELISE
                              (a long look)
                         That's not what I meant.

                                     HUB
                         I know.

               They stand awkwardly in the doorway for a moment.

                                     HUB
                         You want a drink?

                                     ELISE
                         Sure.

               He walks over and opens a bottle of scotch.

                                     ELISE
                         That was a pretty crazy thing you 
                         did today.

               He doesn't respond. Hands her the drink.

                                     HUB
                         Better days.

               She takes a drink. Then another.

                                     ELISE
                         I wanted to -- I... just didn't feel 
                         like... being alone... tonight.

                                     HUB
                         Where's Samir?

                                     ELISE
                         I could call him. Maybe he'd join 
                         us.

                                     HUB
                         You'd like that.

                                     ELISE
                         I might. Or I could call Tina.

                                     HUB
                         555-6354.

               They stare at each other.

                                     ELISE
                         Look, I thought Samir'd be an easy 
                         recruit. He wasn't. It was crazy but 
                         I did what I had to do.
                              (looks at him)
                         You know as well as I do, running an 
                         agent can be very... complicated.

                                     HUB
                         How about running an FBI agent?

                                     ELISE
                         You think I'm trying to run you?

                                     HUB
                              (looks at her)
                         ...Why else are you here?

                                     ELISE
                              (staring right back)
                         ...You know why I'm here.

               It's a charged moment. They're two sad and lonely people.

                                     ELISE
                         Tell me to leave.

                                     HUB
                         Leave.

                                     ELISE
                         No.

               When they embrace, their ferocity and desperation is something 
               more than comfort and less than love.

               THE CHIEF OF STAFF'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

               The Chief of Staff is working late in a cardigan sweater. 
               Devereaux, in his impeccable suit, stands opposite him. Even 
               at ease he is smartly erect.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         The FBI received another fax.

                         Ahmed Bin Talal. They're still under 
                         the impression that we have him.

                         Do we? Have him?

                         To refresh your memory, as I told 
                         you last time, it was the Libyans 
                         who --

                         I remember perfectly well what you 
                         said last time.
                              (looks at him)
                         Do we?

               Devereaux frosts him with a look.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Let me give you some free advice, 
                         son. Don't get between me and the 
                         President. You might break a nail.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         I am speaking for the President.

               He and Devereaux look at each other. It is the moment of 
               plausible deniability.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         As far as the President is 
                         concerned... No, we do not.

               The Chief of Staff accepts the answer because it serves him, 
               for now. And because he has a more pressing agenda.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         General, do you know that after 
                         yesterday's attack, half the parents 
                         in this country kept their children 
                         out of school --?
                              (Devereaux nods)
                         ...They're attacking our way of life. 
                         It's got to stop. And the President 
                         cannot afford to be weak.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                              (reading the subtext)
                         Are you saying the President is 
                         prepared to take the necessary 
                         steps...?

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         I'm saying, the President is prepared 
                         to be... Presidential.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               HUB'S APARTMENT - DAWN

               A ringing phone. Hub wakes up in a tangle of sheets. He looks 
               around and realizes he is alone. Did last night even happen?

                                     HUB
                              (on the phone)
                         Hubbard... What --? ...Slow down, 
                         slow down --

               He reaches for the remote control, turns on the TV.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A GRINDING OF TREADS ON ASPHALT -- DAWN

               as THE FIRST APC enters Brooklyn. Followed by another. And 
               another. And in a sound bite: General Devereaux, IN FATIGUES 
               FOR THE FIRST TIME, and looking like grim death.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Today, with the invocation of the 
                         War Powers Act by the President, I 
                         am declaring a state of martial law 
                         in this city.

               THE BATTLE OF BROOKLYN HAS BEGUN

               Road blocks set up at select intersections. Random stop-and-
               frisk. Patrols of young soldiers in the streets. GANG KIDS, 
               same age, same color, eye them warily.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         To the best of our knowledge, we are 
                         opposed by no more than twenty of 
                         the enemy. He is hiding among a 
                         population of roughly two million.

               THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE

               Is closed. SOLDIERS in full battle-dress stop cars, check 
               trunks, handbags, briefcases, and id's. THE LINE OF HONKING, 
               ANGRY MOTORISTS stretches as far as the eye can see.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Intelligence tells us he is most 
                         likely Arab-speaking, between the 
                         age of fourteen and thirty. Narrowing 
                         the target to fifteen thousand 
                         suspects.

               A SWARTHY TEENAGER is pulled from A CAR by a SERGEANT and 
               led away to a CAMOUFLAGED TENT set up on the bridge.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         We can further reduce that number 
                         down to those who have been in this 
                         country less than six months. Now 
                         you have twenty hiding among two 
                         thousand.

               A CAR TRUNK is inspected. Two women waved through.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         If you are one of these twenty young 
                         men, you can hide among a population 
                         of similar ethnic background. 
                         Unfortunately for you, you can only 
                         hide there. And that population, in 
                         the classic immigration pattern, is 
                         concentrated. Right here in Brooklyn.

               Hub and Sharon stare at the Orwellian tableau.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         We intend to seal off this borough. 
                         And then we intend to squeeze it. 
                         This is the land of opportunity, 
                         gentlemen. The opportunity to turn 
                         yourselves in. After sundown tonight 
                         any young man fitting the profile I 
                         described who has not cooperated 
                         will be arrested and detained.

               Hub and Sharon show their ID's to an MP.

                                     MP
                         Would you follow me, please. The 
                         General is expecting you.

               He leads him to A CAMOUFLAGED TENT on the service roadway.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         There is historically nothing more 
                         corrosive to the morale of an army 
                         than policing its own citizens.

               IN THE TENT

               The swarthy teenager is being interrogated by COL. HARDWICK.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         But the enemy would be sadly mistaken 
                         if they were to doubt our resolve. 
                         They are now face to face with the 
                         most fearsome killing machine in the 
                         history of man. And I intend to use 
                         it. And be back on base in time for 
                         the play-offs... That is all.

               Devereaux sees Hub and strides over to him:

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Hub. Good to see you again.

                                     HUB
                         I can't say the same, sir. Not in 
                         that uniform. I thought you were 
                         against this.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         I am against it. It wasn't my call.

                                     HUB
                         "I'm only following orders" didn't 
                         work at Nuremberg. It may not be 
                         your policy but they're your tactics.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Your operation had its chance, Hub, 
                         and you couldn't get it done. You're 
                         down three touchdowns. Time to bring 
                         in the first string.

                                     HUB
                         Against our own team?

               Devereaux suddenly goes ice cold.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Are you questioning my patriotism?

                                     HUB
                         I'm questioning your judgement, yes, 
                         sir.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Hub, I want you to take a moment and 
                         reflect on my life as a soldier. I 
                         have a dozen tropical diseases I'll 
                         never entirely get rid of. I set off 
                         metal detectors with the shrapnel in 
                         my ass. I have watched men die and I 
                         have killed. Now I am serving my 
                         President and quite possibly not the 
                         best interests of my country, but my 
                         profession doesn't afford me the 
                         luxury of that distinction. I won't 
                         question your patriotism but don't 
                         you ever again question my command.

                                     HUB
                         I'm not under your command, General.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Take a good look around, my friend, 
                         and tell me that's still true.
                              (softening his tone)
                         But we're not shutting you out. In 
                         fact, I can't do it without you, 
                         Hub. I need men like you. Men willing 
                         to put it on the line like you did 
                         in that schoolroom.
                              (gestures to his 
                              uniform)
                         These stars mean I have been putting 
                         it on the line for thirty years... 
                         and never made a mistake worth 
                         remembering. Don't tell me I made a 
                         mistake about you.

               ON THE BRIDGE -- MOMENTS LATER

               Hub and Sharon exit the command tent.

                                     HUB
                              (ironic)
                         They're not shutting us out. They 
                         need men like me.

                                     ELISE
                         He'll fuck it up, the arrogant prick. 
                         You ever met anybody so in love with 
                         the sound of his own voice?

                                     HUB
                         We're putting Samir in play.

                                     ELISE
                         Now? With all this going on? He's 
                         freaked.

                                     HUB
                         Oh, right, he's high-strung. Only 
                         you can manage him. You and the CIA 
                         and the DIA and God-knows-who-else 
                         you're really working for --!
                              (seething)
                         Get back in there, Sharon, Elise, 
                         whatever the fuck your name is -- 
                         They'll probably make you a Colonel... 
                         if you're not one already.

               She gestures at the military leviathan.

                                     ELISE
                         All this... is no more in our interest 
                         than it is in yours, Hub.

                                     HUB
                         What, exactly, are your interests, 
                         Sharon? You protect Samir, you protect 
                         the agency. You're interested in 
                         protecting everything but your 
                         country.

                                     ELISE
                         You have no idea what I do for my 
                         country.

                                     HUB
                         No, and I don't want to know. With 
                         you or without you we're putting 
                         Samir in play. Now.

               She looks at him for a long moment. Considering:

                                     ELISE
                         One more lamb to the slaughter.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A HALF-OPENED DOOR OF AN APARTMENT

               Samir looks and sees Hub, standing beside Sharon.

                                     SAMIR
                         Oh, my God. Oh, my God...

               He tries to SLAM the door, but they force it open. He grabs

               A FAT JOINT from an ashtray and hurries into the bathroom.

                                     HUB
                              (to Sharon)
                         Does he understand the difference 
                         between the FBI and the DEA?

                         Samir... It's fine, he's cool.

               OUTSIDE, the sound of gunfire. Samir reappears, wild-eyed.

                                     SAMIR
                         Listen to that --! Are you listening? 
                         They're killing Arabs out there!

                                     HUB
                         You can stop it all right now.

                                     SAMIR
                         What are you talking about --? The 
                         army is here. They're setting up 
                         interrogation centers right now. 
                         They're torturing people in cellars.

                                     HUB
                         Let's just calm down for a second...

                                     SAMIR
                         -- I've got to get out of here. You 
                         have to help me --

               He goes over and peers out the drawn curtains.

                                     HUB
                              (gentling a horse)
                         We'll take care of you... don't worry. 
                         You just have to calm down --

                                     SAMIR
                         Money... I must have more money...

                                     HUB
                         -- You got a student visa for Ali 
                         Waziri. Because... somebody asked

                                     SAMIR
                         I... got it myself.

               Sharon CRACKS him across the face.

                                     ELISE
                         Liar --!

               Now it's Samir's turn to taste the blood in his mouth.

                                     ELISE
                         You... tell him... what he wants to

                         He knows. He fucking knows.

                                     SAMIR
                         She's crazy. They're ghosts. Jinn. 
                         They'd never trust someone like me.

                                     ELISE
                         Stop simpering.

                                     SAMIR
                         Please...

                                     ELISE
                         I've got a picture of the two of us, 
                         do you remember that picture, Samir?
                              (the mask coming off:)
                         I'm going to post that picture in 
                         every mosque in Brooklyn. And then 
                         I'm gonna send copies to some friends 
                         of mine on the West Bank. You've got 
                         family there, don't you --?

               Hub jumps up, takes Sharon by the arm.

                                     ELISE
                         Let go of me --

               He gives her the BUM'S RUSH out of the apartment, shuts the 
               door, then turns back to Samir, who sits, ashen-faced.

                                     HUB
                         Now... Nobody's going to burn you, 
                         nobody's going to call anybody --
                              (sits beside him)
                         -- Who asked you to get that visa?

               Samir is trembling. Tears roll down his cheeks.

                                     HUB
                         Don't be afraid. I can protect you. 
                         There's nothing to be afraid of.

                                     SAMIR
                         I'm afraid of going to hell.

               Hub just sits there. He knows he's got him. Finally:

                                     SAMIR
                         His name is Tariq Husseini. He runs 
                         an auto shop.
                              (Hub waits for more --)
                         ...on Commerce Street in Red Hook.

                                     HUB
                              (hands him a card)
                         My beeper number. Anybody messes 
                         with you, I'm there in twenty minutes.

               He gets up and walks into:

               THE HALLWAY

               Where Sharon waits. As they head for the stairs we HEAR:

                                     ELISE (V.O.)
                         You're good.

                                     HUB (V.O.)
                         You're not so bad yourself.

               But we are HEARING IT along with:

               COL. HARDWICK

               In a nearby SURVEILLANCE VEHICLE -- where, through the newest 
               microwave technology (the kind the FBI don't yet have), he 
               has OVERHEARD the entire conversation.

               ON A NOTEPAD

               In his lap, the name, "Tariq Husseini."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               OUTSIDE SAMIR'S APARTMENT

               They are in a housing project. Hub dials his cell phone.

                                     ELISE
                         You calling Devereaux.

                                     HUB
                         Didn't get his number. Darn.
                              (on the phone)
                         Floyd, Hub. We need to put something 
                         together in a big-ass hurry... Where's 
                         Frank --?... Give him a 911.

               A YELLOW SCHOOL BUS pulls up beside them and armed soldiers 
               hop out. Sharon watches them as Hub continues:

                                     HUB
                              (on the phone)
                         -- and find some kind of beat-up 
                         car... Well, beat it up yourself if 
                         you have to... 896 Commerce St... 
                         it's a garage in Red Hook... but 
                         remember --
                              (looks at her)
                         -- they're pros.

               A PSY-OPS VAN passes by, broadcasting through a P.A.

                                     VAN LOUDSPEAKER
                         -- all persons without proper 
                         authorization must be off the street 
                         until seven a.m. Failure to comply 
                         will result in immediate arrest.

               The announcement is then repeated in Arabic.

               ROUNDING A CORNER

               They come upon several more YELLOW SCHOOL BUSES. From within 
               the various apartments the SHRILL PROTESTS of mothers and 
               sisters as YOUNG MEN fitting the "terrorist profile" are 
               hustled into the BUSES.

                                     HUB
                         Jesus...

                                     ELISE
                         Tariq will go to ground.

                                     HUB
                         We can hit him in less than an hour.

                                     ELISE
                              (turns to leave)
                         Hit him hard.

                                     HUB
                         Where are you going?

                                     ELISE
                         I've got to stash Samir someplace 
                         safe.
                              (as she goes)
                         Go with God.

               Hub hurries on toward his car, passing TEENAGE GIRLS, 
               defiantly wearing Keffiyahs, who mill about, taunting soldiers 
               with obscenities in English and Arabic.

               AN APC drives past, further inflaming their passions.

               Suddenly, A volley ROCKS AND BOTTLES come hurtling out of 
               nowhere, smashing harmlessly against the armor. The teenagers 
               laugh.

               And then, the sudden CONCUSSION of a small BLAST from UP THE 
               STREET. The teenagers SCREAM and scatter. Hub SPRINTS toward 
               A SMOKING CAR, pulling his weapon from his hip.

               A SOLDIER IS ROLLING ON THE GROUND, SCREAMING beside a PARKED 
               CAR. His leg is shredded. ARMORED JEEPS come squealing around 
               a corner. M-16's are locked, loaded and leveled at Hub.

                                     HUB
                         FBI --! FBI --!

               For a moment, it's touch-and-go as the the terrified RECRUITS, 
               just weeks out of basic training, decide whether to SHOOT. 
               On the ground, the injured soldier keeps SCREAMING.

                                     HUB
                         Now... I'm gonna... reach... into my 
                         jacket... and show you... my shield.

                                     YOUNG SOLDIER
                         Drop your weapon --!

               Hub drops the gun and shows his credentials. The young soldier 
               approaches warily as MEDICS attend to the wounded man.

                                     YOUNG SOLDIER
                         Sorry, Sir. Somebody's booby-trapping 
                         cars... We're all a little spooked.

               The RATTLE of small-arms fire is HEARD from up the street. 
               In the distance, a running FIGURE is chased by three SOLDIERS.

               The transformation is complete: Brooklyn as Gaza.

               REACHING HIS CAR

               Hub climbs in. On a nearby pock-marked wall, a single word, 
               "Intifada."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. AN OLD WAREHOUSE -- LATER

               Hub, who sits in a beat-up old car, a baseball cap worn 
               backwards on his head. He keys his radio.

                                     HUB
                         All Units, report in turn. If talking 
                         will reveal your position, just key 
                         your walkie...

               AN OLD WAREHOUSE -- RED HOOK

               Inside, an AUTO GARAGE. Hoists, compression cylinders, 
               archwelders. Outside, two WINOS share a bottle by the curb. 
               A BEAT-UP DODGE drives up. In it, two scruffy-looking Black 
               MEN. Upon close inspection we realize that one is Hub. The 
               other is Floyd.

                                     HUB
                              (to a mechanic)
                         Yo...

               The mechanic looks out from under a car. He's Hispanic.

                                     MECHANIC
                         Que Pasa?

                                     HUB
                         Tariq around?

               The mechanic gestures to a partitioned-office in the back. 
               As Hub heads toward it, he checks out the other workers: a 
               teenager doing a compression check, another fixes a tire.

               IN THE OFFICE

               Tariq is on the phone talking in Arabic as Hub enters.

                                     HUB
                         Tariq?

               Tariq holds up a finger, hold on. Hub sits opposite him.

                                     TARIQ
                         How can I help you.

                                     HUB
                         You're Tariq Husseini?

                                     TARIQ
                         He's out.

                                     HUB
                         Damn. Do you think you could give 
                         him a message?

                                     TARIQ
                         Of course.

                                     HUB
                         Tell him the FBI is after him.

                                     TARIQ
                         You're joking.

                                     HUB
                         Very... slowly... put your hands on 
                         top of the table.

               Tariq notices that Hub's hands are out of sight beneath the 
               table. Hub draws back the slide of his the weapon with an 
               audible CLICK. Tariq mutters a CURSE in Arabic.

                                     HUB
                         That wouldn't be a racist epithet, 
                         now would it? Stand up.

               As Tariq stands, Hub crosses behind him, kicks out his legs, 
               pats him down, and cuffs him.

               MEANWHILE -- IN THE WAREHOUSE

               The two winos have revealed themselves as shotgun-wielding 
               FBI agents and are now ROUSTING the garage workers.

                                     HUB
                         Where are the others?

                                     TARIQ
                         What others?

               But before Hub can answer, an AMPLIFIED VOICE is heard.

                                     PSY-OPS (V.O.)
                         Tariq Husseini, this is the United 
                         States Army. You are surrounded.

               Hub is as surprised as Tariq.

                                     PSY-OPS
                         You have thirty seconds to throw out 
                         any weapons and exit the premises 
                         with your hands on top of your head.

               One of the agents with the shotgun calls out.

                                     SHOTGUN AGENT
                         -- Sir?

                                     HUB
                         Do as he says.

               As Hub hustles Tariq to his feet, the other agents start to 
               hustle the workers out of door, when:

               THE YOUNG MECHANIC

               Reaches into his overalls.

                                     SHOTGUN AGENT
                         FREEZE--!

               But when the Mechanic pulls his hand out from his overalls, 
               all he is holding is the pin to a GRENADE.

               THE EXPLOSION

               Kills both the FBI agents and their prisoners. Hub throws 
               Tariq to the ground.

               FROM AN UPPER WINDOW

               An AUTOMATIC WEAPON opens fire on the Army presence.

               HIGH ABOVE -- IN A CHOPPER

               Devereaux responds with a dispassionate intensity.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Code blue.

               His order unleashes an overwhelming display of FIREPOWER.

               INSIDE THE WAREHOUSE

               Hub and Tariq crawl for cover as windows EXPLODE, walls are 
               SHREDDED, and incendiary TRACER rounds mix with solvents and 
               gasoline to start a conflagration. With the vaguely 
               hallucinatory quality of the S.L.A. shootout, WHITE NOISE 
               bleeds in and ALL SOUND FADES OUT:

               AN M-60 TANK (SILENT)

               Races in from around the corner, only to be hit by A ROCKET-
               PROPELLED GRENADE fired through the second floor window.

               INT. CHOPPER

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Code Red.

               TWO APACHE ATTACK HELICOPTERS (SILENT)

               Appear from their hiding place behind a nearby building. As 
               they dive into their attack trajectory --

               HUB (SILENT)

               Crawls, dragging Tariq toward the doors as:

               THE CHAIN GUN (SILENT)

               Of the Attack helicopter fires 2,000 rounds a minute -- 
               virtually UNZIPPING the warehouse -- softening it for THE 
               TWO HYDRA ROCKETS that reduce it instantly to a huge FIREBALL.

               IN THE CHOPPER -- DEVEREAUX

               Watches the awesome display of firepower with calm detachment.

               INSIDE THE WAREHOUSE -- TWO SHADOWY FIGURES

               Stagger, blinded, out of the inferno. Hub drags a half-
               conscious Tariq, where they are pounced on by commandos.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               THE STADIUM -- NIGHT

               Pac's and Tanks ring the stadium. An anti-terrorist perimeter 
               has been established -- concrete obstacles, sandbags and 
               razor-wire. Musco-lights cast their pitiless glow.

               OUTSIDE THE PERIMETER

               A mob of frightened parents, girlfriends, and furious fathers. 
               A LAWYER for the ACLU confronts a young Lieutenant.

                                     ACLU LAWYER
                         -- just want to know if my client's 
                         name is on the list.

                         Sir, the list will be updated every 
                         twelve hours and posted in the --

               A gaggle of JOURNALISTS try to force their way in...

                         -- This pass GUARANTEES... You CAN'T -- 
                         ...the first FUCKING AMENDMENT!

                                     LIEUTENANT #2
                         There will be a pool briefing for 
                         all accredited journalists at 0700 
                         hours.

               Hub shows his ID. Is allowed to enter into:

               THE DARK STADIUM TUNNEL

               A MUFFLED CRY that might or might not have come from someone 
               in pain. His footsteps ECHO as he walks out to where:

               2,000 DETAINEES

               All young men between the ages of sixteen and thirty are 
               milling about. Squatting, smoking, pacing, some laughing, 
               most looking terrified. All spread across:

               THE HALOGEN-LIT FOOTBALL FIELD

               Armed GUARDS backlit in the upper tiers. Enlisted men passing 
               out blankets and soup. Nearby, Hub sees Tina, standing quite 
               still -- Finally, she is able to speak.

                                     TINA
                         1942, my father was put into the 
                         camps at Manzanar. Until the end of 
                         the war. Two years. Now he roots for 
                         the Dodgers and swears it could never 
                         happen again.

               MOMENTS LATER -- ON THE FIELD

               Hub asks for Devereaux, is directed across the field, through 
               an aisle in the wire cages. FRANK HADDAD looms out of the 
               shadows. He looks terrible, drawn. Furious.

                                     FRANK
                         They got Frankie. My kid's here 
                         someplace --

                                     HUB
                         Frank, slow down --

                                     FRANK
                              (fighting back tears 
                              of rage)
                         He's only thirteen, for Chrissake --

               Nearby, the "Allahuh Akbar," call, to evening PRAYER.

                                     HUB
                         I'll get him out.

                                     FRANK
                         They came into my house. My wife 
                         told them who I was --
                              (swallows hard)
                         How many times did I put it on the 
                         line, Hub --? How many times --

                                     HUB
                         Frank --

                                     FRANK
                         We're American citizens, twenty years. 
                         Ten years in the bureau -- They 
                         knocked her down... and took him. 
                         Out of my own house.

                                     HUB
                         It's wrong, Frank. What can I say to 
                         you, but it's... all... terribly... 
                         horribly... wrong.
                              (takes his arm)
                         Now, come with me.

                                     FRANK
                         NO! I've got to find him. Besides, 
                         this is where I belong.
                              (takes out his wallet, 
                              hands over his badge)
                         Here. I'm not their sand nigger 
                         anymore.

               Hub watches as he he walks away. A MUEZZIN chants the call 
               to evening prayer. Frank drops to his knees and joins the 
               rest of the prisoners.

               THE LOCKER ROOM

               Has been transformed in a COMMAND POST.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         -- And his name is Haddad?

                                     HUB
                         Frank... Haddad. Junior.

                                     COL. HARDWICK
                         His father's a Shiite. We're checking 
                         him out.

                                     HUB
                         Check this out, pal. His father's a 
                         federal agent for ten years.

                                     COL. HARDWICK
                         Don't get in my face, Hubbard. I 
                         might decide you're an Ethiopian.

                                     HUB
                         And you're just stupid enough to 
                         think that's an insult.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         If a mistake's been made we'll fix 
                         it.

                                     HUB
                         There is no "if". I'm vouching for 
                         this kid. I want him out.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         And I said we will look into it.

                                     HUB
                         You mean, like you're looking into 
                         me? Surveilling me? Breaking up my 
                         operations? If I'd known I was going 
                         to have to do your job for you I 
                         would never have left the army.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         There's an FBI office in Anchorage, 
                         Agent Hubbard. Fuck with me and you'll 
                         be learning a hundred and fifty new 
                         words for snow.

               The two men stare at each other.

                                     HUB
                         Tariq Husseini is my prisoner. I 
                         want to see him.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         The prisoner is being interrogated.

                                     HUB
                         I want to see him.

               Devereaux just looks at him as we CUT TO:

               THE TILED SHOWER ROOM

               Tariq is strapped, NAKED, into a folding metal chair. His 
               head lolls on his chest, his eyes are dulled. On a nearby 
               table, an empty syringe. Two MP'S stand guard.

               Sharon is speaking softly to him in Arabic. Suddenly, Tarak 
               SPITS in her face. She wipes it off as if it is nothing.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         How long have you been at it?

                                     ELISE
                         Not long enough, apparently.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         How much longer, do you think, before 
                         he gives up the other cells --

                                     HUB
                         He can't give up the other cells if 
                         he doesn't know about them.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         He knows.

                                     HUB
                              (gestures to Sharon)
                         What about her briefing? The strategy 
                         session -- she said the cells don't 
                         know about each other, that they --

               Devereaux ignores him. Turns to Sharon.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         How long before he breaks?

                                     ELISE
                         At this rate. Too long. The theatre 
                         was hit nine hours after we took 
                         down the first cell.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         So -- what other models do we have --
                         ?

               No one wants to be the first to step into uncharted terrain.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Shaking.

               Nobody answers.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         What about it, Sharon?

                                     ELISE
                         -- Won't work.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Works for the Israelis.

                         Only in conjunction with sleep 
                         deprivation. Needs at least thirty-
                         six hours.

               Hub stares at Sharon -- as the dark side of her professional 
               life is revealed.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         We don't have thirty-six hours.

               Another silence. They're teetering on the edge of the abyss.

                         Electric shock?

                         The neurotransmitters just shut down.

                                     COL. HARDWICK
                         Palestinian authority is producing 
                         good intel using water.

               Hub finally can't take another second. Even in theory.

                                     HUB

                         The time has come for one man to 
                         suffer in order to save the lives of 
                         hundreds

                                     HUB
                         How about two men? How about three? 
                         How about public executions, that 
                         might work.

                         You're welcome to wait outside.

                         General... you've lost men, I've 
                         lost men... but what you're doing... 
                         It doesn't work in Belfast. It doesn't 
                         work in Gaza. And it won't work here.
                              (it comes slowly at 
                              first, then in a 
                              rush:)
                         -- What if... they don't want their 
                         leader back at all? You said yourself, 
                         we don't even have him. Maybe what 
                         they really want -- is that we herd 
                         our children into stadiums. Put 
                         soldiers into our streets. Radicalize 
                         people who want to think of themselves 
                         as Americans. Bend the law, shred 
                         the constitution.
                              (searches for the 
                              kind of words that 
                              come so hard to him:)
                         Because if we torture him -- and 
                         let's call it what it is... You... 
                         and I... then the country men like 
                         us have sworn to defend. And bled to 
                         defend. And died to defend... is 
                         gone.
                              (a deep breath)
                         And they've won.

               Gen. Devereaux stares hard at Hub. And then:

                                     DEVEREAUX
                              (to Col. Hardwick)
                         I think we have to soundproof the 
                         room before we begin.

               Hub looks at Sharon, who looks away.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Escort him out.

               The two MPs lead Hub out of the room.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Let's get this over with.

               OUTSIDE THE LOCKER ROOM -- HOURS LATER

               Sharon emerges from the shower room. She is shattered. The 
               blood drained from her face. As if carrying with her all the 
               sin that was committed in the next room.

               FROM INSIDE THE SHOWER ROOM

               The sound of a GUNSHOT. The door opens and Devereaux emerges, 
               in the torment of a man of honor who is living a lie.

                                     ELISE
                         He knew nothing.

               Devereaux turns and walks off down the corridor.

               THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL

               Glorious, alabaster stone -- floodlit at night. A symbol of 
               all that is good and free and just. Hub drives a rental car, 
               staring out at the monuments.

               IN GEORGETOWN

               Hub pulls up to a lovely TOWNHOUSE. Parked on the street, an 
               UNMARKED CAR from the Secret Service.

               THE CHIEF OF STAFF

               Opens the door, wearing a Dartmouth lacrosse team t-shirt.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         C'mon in, we're still trying to get 
                         the last one down.

               In the background, we HEAR a three-year-old crying.

               IN THE LIVING ROOM - LATER

               Tasteful antiques, rag rugs and kids' toys.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         ...The President wants this shit 
                         over with. There's only one way to 
                         do that.
                              (looks at Hub)
                         Let the Sheik go.

                                     HUB
                         So we do have the Sheik?

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         You think our government operates as 
                         a single coherent entity? Devereaux 
                         just... pushed the agenda.
                              (carefully)
                         Of course the President was completely 
                         unaware of it.

                                     HUB
                              (return of serve)
                         Of course.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         Now we can't just let him go. America 
                         has to stand tall in the world yadda 
                         yadda yadda. So what we do is...
                              (the punch line)
                         We let the American justice system 
                         do its work.

               His wife appears, holding a squalling baby, looking defeated.

                                     WIFE
                         -- Honey...?

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         I'll be right up, darling.

               She grits her teeth and goes upstairs.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         You have kids? They're great. 
                         Sometimes you just want to... drug 
                         them.

                                     HUB
                         What do you mean, let the justice 
                         system do its work.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         We don't release him. A judge releases 
                         him. You're an FBI man. That's what 
                         judges are good at, right?
                              (off Hub's look)
                         It's not like we've gone after him 
                         in proper prosectorial fashion. 
                         Kidnaping him. Holding him in 
                         isolation. "Fruit of the poisoned 
                         tree" -- remember that one from law 
                         school? Oh, we'll have a big trial. 
                         Everybody'll get their rocks off... 
                         But the fact is --
                              (the punch line)
                         -- the sheik will walk.

               He looks at Hub, shakes his head.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         ...And this whole episode becomes 
                         nothing more than the news cycle 
                         before the next news cycle.

               He hands Hub an ACCORDION FILE.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         Documentary evidence of Devereaux's 
                         whole operation.

                                     HUB
                         Why me?

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         Because you'll know what to do with 
                         it.

               Hub looks at the file in his hands. Considering.

                                     HUB
                         And what about her?

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         Who?

                                     HUB
                         You know who. How much is she 
                         complicit in all this?

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         Ask her.

               Hub looks up. Sharon emerges from the hallway.

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               ON THE STREETS OF GEORGETOWN -- LATER THAT NIGHT

               Hub and Sharon sit in silence in Hub's rental car:

                                     ELISE
                         I ran an Iraqi network for two years. 
                         Samir recruited them from among the 
                         Sheik's followers. I trained them in 
                         the North. Then we played them back 
                         into Baghdad, two, three at a time, 
                         hiding them in the mosques...

               Her voice softens just a bit as memory takes over.

                                     ELISE
                         It was gonna be beautiful.
                              (looks away)
                         -- And then there was a policy shift --

               She thought telling the story would be easy, but there's an 
               enormous well of untapped feeling. She fights it back:

                                     ELISE
                         -- The new doctrine was: Iran will 
                         be too powerful if Iraq falls apart.
                              (her voice trembles)
                         And it's not like... we sold them 
                         out. Exactly. We just... stopped... 
                         helping them. And I wasn't allowed 
                         to tell them what was coming down. I 
                         was ordered not to tell them.
                              (fighting back tears)
                         -- And they got slaughtered.

               She turns away.

                                     ELISE
                         You've got to understand -- these 
                         people... believe. Paradise. Bliss. 
                         To us they're just words. But to 
                         them... It's very beautiful, actually. 
                         And when you look at their lives, 
                         the heartbreak... And what do we do? 
                         We think, aha, we can take advantage 
                         of that.
                              (losing it)
                         So I quit. I came home. I just 
                         can't... do it... anymore.

               She doesn't want to reveal herself this way. Doesn't want to 
               be vulnerable. Doesn't want to cling to him. For a moment He 
               puts his arms around her, but it's like holding a beautiful, 
               dangerous predator.

                                     HUB
                         -- But first, you helped them.

               She senses the hardness in his tone. Looks up at him, and 
               through tears, puts her game face back on.

                                     ELISE
                         What do you mean --?

                                     HUB
                         They were being slaughtered. They 
                         needed to get out. But they were on 
                         the watch list. So you got them visas. 
                         You and Samir.

                                     ELISE
                         I promised we would take care of 
                         them. They were working... for us.

                                     HUB
                         Doing what, exactly?

                                     ELISE
                         I don't know what you mean.

                                     HUB
                         You said you trained them. Tradecraft. 
                         Subversion. That's what you said, 
                         right?
                              (she nods)
                         Only you left something out, didn't 
                         you... Didn't you, Sharon?
                              (she can't bring 
                              herself to look at 
                              him)
                         You taught them how to make bombs.

               The tears are streaming down her face now. Finally, she nods.

                                     HUB
                         -- And now they're here, doing what 
                         you taught 'em.

               The streetlight catches Sharon's face. Her eyes are haunted.

                                     ELISE
                         And I'm going to have to live with 
                         the hell of that for the rest of my 
                         life.

               BOROUGH HALL PARK -- LATER THAT DAY

                                     MARCH ORGANIZER
                              (handing out leaflets)
                         March on city hall. Today. No fear.

               Hub and Frank are standing outside Hub's car, each on opposite 
               sides, blocking any opportunity to suveil what is happening 
               within.

               Sharon sits inside with Samir. She uses a SCALPEL to make 
               the slightest INCISION under Samir's arm. The RADIO plays.

                                     SAMIR
                         Ahhhhhh...

                                     ELISE
                         In case you decide to go on walkabout.

               Into the incision she inserts a tiny plastic TRANSMITTER.

                                     ELISE
                         How did you make contact?

                                     SAMIR
                         He is Afghani. Ahhhh. He got word to 
                         my uncle at the bath-house. You never 
                         met him.

                                     ELISE
                         But you're sure he'll show up.

                                     SAMIR
                              (trembling)
                         Sharon, they are all dead but the 
                         last cell and they are crazy with 
                         fear. Just tell me the message and I 
                         will pass it on.

                                     ELISE
                         I need to deliver it in person. 
                         Believe me, they'll want to hear 
                         what I have to say.

               She turns off the radio.

               OUTSIDE THE CAR

               Hub and Frank glance inconspicuously around.

                                     HUB
                         You watch the game?

               On a piece of paper he has scribbled, "Hit Hardwick. Safe 
               House. 11:00."

                                     FRANK
                              (nods yes, then:)
                         Kannell was really on.

               Hub then writes. "Bath-house. 12:00."

                                     FRANK
                              (nods again)
                         Think they'll make the play-offs?

               Hub looks at him. There's been little time for sentiment.

                                     HUB
                         How's your boy?

                                     FRANK
                         He's alright. Thanks for getting him 
                         out.

               Sharon steps out of the car. In her hands is a device 
               resembling a PORTABLE OSCILLOSCOPE. A green dot appears.

                                     ELISE
                         That's Samir.

                                     HUB
                              (looks in at Samir)
                         Green is about right.

               He slips Sharon the scribbled notes. As she looks at them:

                                     ELISE
                         He's terrified. Then again, so am I.

                                     HUB
                         You sure he'll go through with it?

                                     ELISE
                         If he doesn't he knows I'll give him 
                         to Devereaux.
                              (She mouths, "They 
                              out there?" Hub nods)
                         How's it feel to be on the other end 
                         of it?

                                     HUB
                         I like watching better.

                                     ELISE
                         This is the endgame, you understand 
                         that? If this goes wrong --

                                     HUB
                         Nothing's going wrong.

                                     ELISE
                         We're the CIA, something always goes 
                         wrong.

               The car door opens and Samir steps out, buttoning his shirt.

                                     ELISE
                         I don't suppose there's any way you 
                         would trust me to do this on my own?
                              (off his look)
                         I thought not. Well, in case it gets 
                         hairy, remember... the most committed 
                         wins.

               Hub watches as she and Samir walk away.

                                     FRANK
                         I trust her about as far as I can 
                         throw her.

                                     HUB
                         That far?

               SHARON AND SAMIR -- CONTINUOUS

               They hurry through the park. Samir is extremely agitated, 
               eyes constantly darting from right to left.

                                     SAMIR
                         This is not the way to the bath-house. 
                         You said to get a key from my uncle 
                         so that we --

                                     ELISE
                         Shhhhhh... If you'd stop whining 
                         you'd feel the surveillance.

               Colonel Hardwick, earphones on, overhearing them:

                         and then cross against the traffic.

               On Col. Hardwick's computer, a GRID MAP of Brooklyn.

                         Sound garden's ready.

               A TRIANGULATED FIELD OF MICROPHONES

               On a nearby rooftop, an Army spotter uses a parabolic with a 
               gunsight. Another mic is in a woman's shopping bag; another 
               is in a twenty year-old's boom box.

                                     SAMIR (V.O.)
                              (trembling)
                         Sharon, please, I beg you. Do not 
                         make me do this. If they even dream 
                         we are being followed they will kill 
                         us.

               The light turns RED, they race across a crowded street.

               THROUGH AN ARAB NEIGHBORHOOD

               Where women in chadors carry mesh bags with tonight's meal.

               INTO A CLEAN APARTMENT

               Nothing but a single bed with a dirty white sheet. Sharon 
               enters and turns on the TV... loud.

                                     ELISE
                         Sit.
                              (takes out a pocket-
                              knife)
                         Raise your arm.

                                     SAMIR
                         What are you doing?

               She cuts the stitches under his armpit and begins to dig out 
               the transponder.

                                     ELISE
                         They cannot even dream we are being 
                         followed, isn't that what you said?

               Sharon very deliberately wipes her BLOODY HANDS on the WHITE 
               SHEETS.

               On TV, we SEE the MARCHERS in front of Brooklyn Borough hall.

                                     SPEAKER

               They appear as SPECTRAL images on Hardwick's microwave screen.

                         -- so American. Can you imagine a 
                         better target?

               BOROUGH HALL

               THE CROWD is getting fired up as the SPEAKER exhorts them. 
               SOLDIERS watch uneasily, not certain how to respond as the 
               crowd begins to CHANT, "No Fear! No fear!"

               THE APARTMENT

               Sharon goes to a closet and takes out some old clothes. She 
               TURNS OFF THE TV. Then:

                                     ELISE
                         Here. Put this on. We don't want our 
                         friends sweating too much while they 
                         wait.

               IN THE VAN

               Hardwick speaks into a handset.

                                     COL. HARDWICK
                         They're getting ready to move. Units 
                         1 and 2, on my signal --

               SUDDENLY -- THREE UNMARKED FBI CARS

               Seem to materialize out of nowhere -- boxing them in.

               ON THE STREET

               Undercover FEDERAL AGENTS roust Army CID agents. An FBI agent 
               with a deep drawl, spread-eagles one against a building:

                                     SOUTHERN FBI AGENT
                         Hi, there, I'm new in town. Can you 
                         direct me to Carnegie Hall, or should 
                         I just go fuck myself --

               The NYPD under the command of Danny Sussman -- roll up the 
               rest of the sound garden -- examine the parabolic microphones.

               AGENTS WIELDING SHOTGUNS

               Blow off the rear door of the surveillance van. Frank enters 
               and looks around at all the high-tech, microwave technology.

                                     FRANK
                         Ah, microwave.

               TWO WOMEN

               In chadors, faces VEILED, descend a back staircase. Only as 
               their faces emerge from the shadows and are caught by a dim 
               bulb do we recognize Sharon and Samir.

               Sharon unlocks a metal door to reveal THE HIDDEN COURTYARD 
               of a neighboring building. She and Samir hurry through a 
               back alley and out into an adjacent street.

               BOROUGH HALL (WAS SHOT AS 194)

               Where several APC's suddenly roar up and BLOCK off the square. 
               Devereaux stands nearby, watching as:

                              (though a bullhorn)
                         This is an unlawful gathering. You 
                         must disperse. I repeat --

               Soldiers in full RIOT GEAR emerge to form a battle line: 
               images of Selma, 1963; Chicago, 1968; Los Angeles, 1993.

                                     PROTEST SPEAKER
                         Join together! Join hands!

               THE MARCHERS LINK ARMS

               Arab clerics and Hassidic rabbis, Black civic leaders and 
               Hispanic gang members -- all continue to CHANT, "No fear!"

                                     THE YOUNG SOLDIERS
                         Nervously look at one another as the 
                         marchers begin to move.

                                     LIEUTENANT #2
                              (through a bullhorn)
                         These soldiers carry live ammunition. 
                         This is your final warning.

               "No Fear... No Fear..." Devereaux watches in dread as the 
               marchers close the gap on the battle-line of anxious soldiers 
               is this why he became a soldier?

               A YOUNG GIRL unselfconsciously approaches a young soldier. 
               Looks into his eyes. Smiles. And walks past. Another marcher 
               walks right past a soldier, who does nothing to stop her. 
               Soon, they are all surging past the riot-line.

               DEVEREAUX watches, as something is revealed to him, something 
               about America that, until this moment, he had forgotten.

               IN THE SURVEILLANCE VAN

               Frank is fiddling with the new technology like a kid at 
               Christmas. But something is wrong. Where once there were TWO 
               GHOSTLY IMAGES of Samir and Sharon in the apartment -- now 
               there is NOTHING.

               ON HUB'S OSCILLOSCOPE

               The RADIO-SIGNAL of Samir's transmitter still registers as 
               an unmoving, steadily blinking light. Hub is watching the 
               building. Frank steps out the van, his face pale.

                                     FRANK
                         We've got a problem.

               HUB AND FRANK

               Pound up the stairs of the building.

               THE DOOR TO THE CLEAN APARTMENT

               Bursts open. Hub comes in low and fast. Frank comes in hard 
               on his heels.

               In the center of the otherwise empty room, the white sheet, 
               SMEARED IN BLOOD, is draped over a chair.

                                     FRANK
                         What the --

               Hub stares in dread fascination.

                                     HUB
                         It's a shroud.

               And he's out the door in a heartbeat.

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               BACK IN THE SURVEILLANCE VAN

               Frank and Hub listen to a playback of Sharon's conversation 
               with Samir on the digital recorders.

                                     ELISE
                         "...sweating too much while they 
                         wait."

               Frank looks up at Hub.

                                     HUB
                         First she turns off the tv, then she 
                         says it.

                                     FRANK
                         She knew we were listening.

               It hits them both at the same time.

                                     HUB
                         The hammam.

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               EXT. THE SURVEILLANCE VAN

               Hub and Frank hit the street at a dead run.

               BENEATH THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE

               Samir opens a padlocked door with a key. He and Sharon 
               disappear within.

               A HAMMAM

               An Arab bath-house. Rays of sunlight play off the steaming 
               waters. Their footsteps ECHO off the tiled mosaic walls.

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               IN THE BATHOUSE

               Samir kneels to touch the steaming water.

                                     ELISE
                         How soon are they coming?

                                     SAMIR
                         They'll be here.

               He starts taking off his clothes.

                                     ELISE
                         What are you doing --?

               He finishes disrobing.

               NAKED

               He steps into the bath. With a sponge he washes his body.

                                     SAMIR
                         What message do you have for them, 
                         Sharon?

                                     ELISE
                         I'll tell them when they're here.

               The DISTANT SOUND of the approaching MARCH echoes off the 
               tiled walls as Samir steps out of the purifying waters and 
               takes a towel from a hamper.

                                     ELISE
                         Nobody else is coming, is there?

                                     SAMIR
                         That's right.

               From the hamper he takes a Sig-Sauer .9 automatic.

                                     ELISE
                         You're the last cell.

                                     SAMIR
                         There will never be a last cell.
                              (racks the slide of 
                              the .9)
                         You should listen to the young men 
                         in that stadium. It is just beginning.

               Sharon watches, in dread fascination, as he takes a white 
               egyptian-cotton FUNERAL SHROUD and drops it over his head.

               THE MARCHERS

               Are streaming down the street.

               Hub and Frank desperately fight their way through a wild, 
               almost "carnival" feel.

               BACK TO -- THE BATHS

               Reflected in the purifying waters, Samir is putting civilian 
               clothes on over the shroud -- still holding the .9 on Sharon.

                                     ELISE
                         How could I have missed the play --

                                     SAMIR
                              (a forgiving gesture)
                         It was the money. You believe money 
                         is power. Belief is power.

                                     ELISE
                         -- Just tell me we didn't finance 
                         your operation...

                                     SAMIR
                              (a sad smile)
                         The world is a wheel. So... what 
                         message do you have for me, Sharon?

                                     ELISE
                         They're going to release him.

                                     SAMIR
                         Praise God. When will he be free --?

                                     ELISE
                         A few months at most. First, they 
                         have to bring him to trial, but --

               He turns away from her, opening the hamper.

                                     SAMIR
                              (not looking at her)
                         -- No.

                                     ELISE
                         -- But... that's what you want, isn't 
                         it? Why you've done all this --

               BELT OF SEMTEX EXPLOSIVES

               Comes next. Velcro straps fasten the belt around his chest.

                                     SAMIR
                         No. It's not.

               He comes to stand beside her.

                                     SAMIR
                         I want you to bleed... as we have 
                         bled.

                                     ELISE
                         Samir, the Koran preaches --

                                     SAMIR
                         Do not speak to me of the Koran, 
                         woman.
                              (fighting his emotion)
                         You take our leader. A holy man. You 
                         put him in prison for preaching the 
                         word of God. You must learn the 
                         consequences of trying to tell the 
                         world how to live.

                                     ELISE
                              (with rising terror)
                         But it's over, your point's been 
                         made, why spill any more blood? Those 
                         poor people out there in the street, 
                         they're fucking marching for your 
                         cause...

                                     SAMIR
                         Yes.
                              (fastens the last 
                              strap on his semtex 
                              harness)
                         And they, too, will become its 
                         martyrs.

               A VOICE from the top of the stairs:

                                     HUB (V.O.)
                         Let her go and you'll live.

               Samir looks up, sees Hub aiming his .45. But Sharon is between 
               them, blocking his shot.

               From outside, we HEAR the sound of the marchers' CHANTING, 
               "No Fear...! No Fear...!" Samir HEARS it, too.

                                     SAMIR
                         Move away from the door.

                                     ELISE
                         NO --!!!

                                     HUB
                         Let her go and you'll live --

                                     ELISE
                         DON'T --!!!!

                                     SAMIR
                              (screaming, panicked)
                         GET AWAY FROM THE DOOR --!!!

                                     HUB
                         SAMIR --!

                                     SAMIR
                         YOU WANT TO DIE --!!

               They're all SCREAMING at once. Still Samir keeps inching 
               toward the stairs. Hub blocks the way.

                                     HUB
                         No way you're going out there.

               Samir jams the gun into Sharon's ribs.

                                     SAMIR
                         MOVE AWAY --!

               Sharon's eyes meet Hubs'.

                                     ELISE
                         Shoot.

                                     HUB
                         Shut up.

                                     ELISE
                         Shoot.

                                     HUB
                         SHUT UP...

               Samir is edging ever closer. Starting up the stairs. Sharon's 
               eyes plead with Hub, begging for a kind of unholy redemption.

                                     ELISE
                         SHOOT ME --!!!

                                     HUB
                         I... CAN'T --!

                                     ELISE
                         YOU HAVE TO.
                              (weeping now)
                         You... promised...

               Hub's finger tightens on the trigger. But then slowly, almost 
               imperceptibly at first, he lowers his gun.

                                     ELISE
                              (sobbing)
                         No --!!!

                                     SAMIR
                         It is God's will.

               His left hand moves imperceptibly toward the RIPCORD of the 
               explosive device.

                                     HUB
                         If there is a God, he weeps at the 
                         crimes we commit in his name.

               HIS FIRST SHOT

               Rips through Sharon into Samir, blowing them both backwards.

               HIS SECOND SHOT

               Is to Samir's hand as it reaches for the ripcord.

               THE THIRD SHOT

               Is a killing headshot. Rolling him into the baths.

               CLOUD OF BLOOD

               Blooms in the cleansing water. The funeral shroud billows.

               THE ECHO OF THE SHOTS

               Still rings in the tiled room as Hub kneels beside Sharon.

                                     HUB
                              (on radio)
                         Officer down. OFFICER DOWN --!

                                     ELISE
                         Is... he... dead?

                                     HUB
                         ...Shhhhhhh...

                                     ELISE
                              (whispers)
                         ...no... regrets...

               Hub cradles her head.

                                     HUB
                         You... knew.

                                     ELISE
                              (the saddest smile)
                         I... wondered.

               FRANK HADDAD

               Appears at the top of the steps. Behind him, two PARAMEDICS 
               race down to kneel beside Sharon. Hub is pushed aside as 
               they begin triage -- but it doesn't look good as suddenly, 
               she begins to convulse.

                                     HUB
                         Sharon... SHARON --

                                     ELISE
                         ... Emma... My name... is Emma.

               And then she begins to mumble, at first incoherently, and 
               then more clearly. We realize she's speaking Arabic.

                                     HUB
                         -- what are you? I don't...

               And then Frank is standing above them. Tears in his eyes.

                                     FRANK
                              (translating)
                         "I... seek refuge... king of kings..."

               And Hub suddenly understands: she is preparing for her own 
               death. He holds her as she continues to pray in and out of 
               her two native tongues. Until, at last:

                                     SHARON/EMMA
                              (whispers)
                         Allah Ahkbar. God is great --

                                     FRANK
                         Allah Ahkbar --

                                     HUB
                         Amen.

               And she's gone.

               OUTSIDE IN THE STREETS -- MOMENTS LATER

               A block away, we can see the Marchers pass by. The chant of 
               "No Fear..." fades into the distance. But Hub has already 
               turned his back and is hurrying away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COURTHOUSE SQUARE -- MOMENTS LATER

               Hub hurries toward the Courthouse.

               MOMENTS LATER - IN THE COURTHOUSE

               JUDGE FRANKEL opens the door. He is taken aback by the blood 
               on Hub's clothes.

                                     HUB
                         I want to talk about a free society.

                                                                   BACK TO:

               THE STADIUM COMMAND POST

               Where Devereaux is watching coverage of the march.

                                     TV SOUND BITE (V.O.)
                         -- "a very moving moment in which 
                         the people of a city step forward to 
                         declare their courage and solidarity --

               He looks up to see Hub. He's carrying the ACCORDION FILE 
               that the Chief of Staff gave him.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Agent Hubbard, do you want to tell 
                         me exactly what you mean detaining 
                         Colonel Hardwick and six of my CID 
                         staff. Because that strikes me as a 
                         very peculiar idea of interagency 
                         liaison.

                                     HUB
                         The last cell has been taken down. 
                         It was Samir. I took him out.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         What makes you so sure he was the 
                         last cell?

                                     HUB
                         Sharon.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Sharon is not trustworthy.

                                     HUB
                         Sharon is dead. She gave her life.
                              (takes a piece of 
                              paper from his pocket)
                         This is a writ from the US District 
                         Court releasing all those being held 
                         here without habeus corpus.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         My authority supersedes the civilian 
                         judiciary under the decree of martial 
                         law.
                              (a rueful smile)
                         Sorry.

                                     HUB
                         Your authority ends now. It's all 
                         over.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         What's over.

                                     HUB
                              (looks at him)
                         They're going to release him.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Release him?

                                     HUB
                         The Sheik.
                              (holds up the Chief 
                              of Staff's' file)
                         Clear violation of international 
                         law, Congressional oversight statutes, 
                         a couple of treaties, the Federal 
                         perjury statute, and my favorite, 
                         the Logan Act, for conducting your 
                         own personal foreign policy.
                              (simply)
                         I know the whole story, General.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         You don't know shit. Poor suffering 
                         Sharon and her poor suffering people. 
                         It's called "going native" -- the 
                         most elementary error of an 
                         intelligence operative and she made 
                         it. She had all of you working for 
                         her and she was working for them 
                         without even knowing it. And now 
                         they're getting exactly what they 
                         want, which is the Sheik will be 
                         back in the mix. But ten times as 
                         strong, because now he's the big man 
                         who stood up to the Americans.
                              (looks at Hub)
                         I did what was necessary. I make no 
                         apologies. If you think you're going 
                         to be able to use that file against 
                         me, you know even less about politics 
                         than I imagined.

                                     HUB
                         General. I'm not in politics. You 
                         can have this back. I won't use it.

               Hub hands him the file. Devereaux takes it.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Because you don't have the balls.
                              (off Hub's look)
                         Did you expect me to get all weepy 
                         with gratitude? You serve your 
                         country.
                              (dismissively)
                         Is there anything else?

               Hub would love to just... clock him. Instead:

                                     HUB
                         I said I wasn't in politics. I'm 
                         not. I'm in law enforcement.

               He takes his gun from its shoulder holster.

                                     HUB
                         William Devereaux, you are under 
                         arrest for the torture and murder of 
                         Tariq Husseini under color of 
                         authority, United States Code Title 
                         42, Chapter 21, Subchapter 1, Sections 
                         1983.
                              (takes out his gun)
                         Surrender your weapon.

               Behind them, a COMMOTION as Frank and several agents force 
               their way into the room, followed by REPORTERS, who shout 
               questions as STROBES and VIDEOTAPE record the arrest.

               OUTSIDE THE STADIUM

               An NYPD car -- Devereaux within, pulls away, lights flashing.

               HUNDREDS OF YOUNG ARAB BOYS

               Emerge from tunnel and into the waiting arms of their mothers, 
               the tearful smiles of their wives and children. Hub and Frank 
               stand there, watching the reunions.

                                     FRANK
                              (after a moment)
                         Did we win or did we lose --?

               Hub has no answer. No one has the answer.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END
