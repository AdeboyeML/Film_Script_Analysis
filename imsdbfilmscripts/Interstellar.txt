          SPACE.
                         
          But not the dark lonely corner of it we're used to. This is
          a glittering inferno -- the center of a distant galaxy.
                         
          Suddenly, something TEARS past at incredible speed: a NEUTRON
          STAR. It SMASHES headlong through everything it encounters...
          planets, stars. Can anything stop this juggernaut?
                         
          Yes. Something looms at the heart of the galaxy, hidden
          inside the blinding starlight, a dark flaw in the fabric of
          existence itself: a BLACK HOLE.
                         
          The neutron star is pulled into the black hole's swirl,
          spiraling closer and closer to destruction. Finally, it
          contacts the hole's edge and EXPLODES.
                         
          The EXPLOSION is so powerful that it sends shock waves into
          the fabric of space-time itself. We ride one of these waves,
          racing back out from the black hole.
                         
          Suddenly, a portion of the wave disappears down a crystal-
          like hole, emerging in a much darker region of the universe --
          a backwater that, as the wave races past a giant red planet
          with a distinctive eye, we recognize as our own.
                         
          The wave, now just an infinitesimal ripple, finally reaches
          our blue planet. It drops into our atmosphere over North
          America, toward the high desert east of the Cascades, and
          through the roof of a nondescript warehouse.
                         
          The wave tickles the atoms in the steel shell of a vacuum
          chamber, then dances a tiny jig with a laser beam reflected
          in a heavy piece of glass.
                         
          The wave shoots back out of the building and disappears in
          the fractal branches of a tumbleweed resting against a
          concrete tube that stretches for miles in the desert.
                         
          An SUV speeds past the tumbleweed and we follow it till it
          parks at another plain-looking building at the opposite end
          of the tube. A MAN climbs out of the SUV.

          a series of echoes.

           Yesterday morning, our facility in
           Hanford identified this signal: a
           neutron star colliding with a
           supermassive black hole. We went
           through the last year's data and
           triangulated the source.

          Cooper lands the plane on a deserted roadway. Jumps down.
                         
          He intercepts one of the combines as it trundles past, trying

          Riggs starts walking up the dune. Cooper follows.
                         
          Below, on the beach, a dozen more combines and other farming

          At the very bottom is a ROUND BLACK BALL, about a foot across --
          the same object we saw punch a hole in the side of a

          Cooper checks his rad meter. A tiny reading -- non-lethal.
          He takes off his watch and hands it to Riggs. Then he slides
          down into the hole.
                         
          The probe CHIRPS as Cooper slides down on top of it. He

          out of the crater and onto the beach.

          INT. BEDROOM, COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY
                         
          Cooper wakes. He's been sleeping with a pillow wrapped around
          his head. The SHRIEK can be heard, but it's muffled, distant.
           25.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY
                         
          Tom heads off for school with Donald. Murph, still suspended,
          looks up at Cooper, smiling.
                         
                          MURPH

                          COOPER
           You're staying here and cleaning the
           house.
                         
          Murph looks crestfallen. He looks out towards the yard.
          Cooper follows his stare.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           I told you, Murph. There's no one
           to take it back to.
                         
                          MURPH
           But what if there is, dad? What if
           there's something we can salvage?
                         
          Cooper thinks it over. Murph scrambles to get his shoes.
                         
          EXT. COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY
                         
          The shriek is still muffled. Cooper walks over to the well,
          putting in a pair of earplugs.
                         
          A line is staked off, leading down into the well below.
          Cooper begins hauling the line up.
                         
          As the probe breaks the surface of the water, the SHRIEK
          returns to its normal volume. Cooper rolls the probe out
          onto the ground.
                         
          INT. PIPER CUB -- DAY
                         
          The probe CHIRPS next to Murph in the backseat as Cooper
          spins the plane and guns the throttle and they bounce along
          the dusty runway and into the air.
                         
          EXT. CALIFORNIA COAST -- DAY

          EXT. SKIES OVER LOS ANGELES -- DAY
                         
          Cooper flies in low. Los Angeles looks much the same way it
          did in the early 20th century -- small settlements in Santa
          Monica and Downtown. Wildfires and earthquakes have shaken
          and burned what was left of the homes in between.
           26.
                         
          EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY, MALIBU -- DAY
                         
          Cooper puts the plane down on the old highway and taxis up
          to a gas station. Ahead, the Coast Highway peters out and
          disappears beneath rows of wild grass -- Malibu has become
          ranchland, once again.
                         
          EXT. GAS STATION, MALIBU -- DAY
                         
          An OLD MAN looks up as Cooper steps out of the plane and
          checks it over.
                         
                          COOPER
           Got any diesel?
                         
                          OLD MAN
           Plenty. Shame you can't eat it.
                         
          Cooper stretches the hose over to the plane.
                         
          INT. PIPER CUB -- DAY
                         
          Cooper rests a hand lightly on the controls as he follows
          the coast. Murph gazes out the window. In the backseat,
          the probe is HUMMING.
                         
          A light marine layer beneath them parts, revealing SANTA
          CRUZ ISLAND, a large, uninhabited island.
                         
          As Cooper soars over the island, the probe HUMS, insistent.
                         
                          MURPH
           I think it's home.
                         
          Cooper circles the island until he finds a long, flat
          grassland in the center of the island.
                         
          EXT. FIELD, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY
                         
          The plane bounces and hops to a halt in waist-deep grass.
                         
          Murph and Cooper climb down from the plane. Cooper slings a
          rifle over his shoulder.
                         
          A few dozen yards from the plane they reach the tree line.
          Murph stops, mesmerized by a patch of weeds studded with
          bright red -- strawberries.
                         
                          MURPH
           Dad, what are these things?
                         
                          COOPER
           I don't know. Don't touch them.
           27.
                         
          Cooper spots something in the foliage ahead that looks a
          little off. He walks over.
                         
          He pokes at the undergrowth with his rifle. The rifle CLANKS
          against something metal. Cooper reaches -- it's a camouflage
          scrim. He gently pulls it aside, revealing a chemical
          transport truck.
                         
          Cooper steps back, alarmed. He brings up his rifle.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Murph?
                         
          He looks around. Murph is nowhere to be seen. Cooper curses
          and heads into the forest to look for him.
                         
          EXT. CLEARING, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY
                         
          Cooper walks through a glade. He stops to get his bearings.
          Leans against a tree. Snatches his hand back -- the trunk
          of the tree is red hot.
                         
          Cooper steps back -- it's not a tree at all, but a camouflaged
          chimney stack. He looks up: the tree is venting steam.
                         
          Cooper walks a little further, until he finds several massive
          tanks. The tanks are filling with a bubbling liquid -- some
          kind of industrial process is taking place beneath him.
                         
          Cooper finally catches up with Murph at the edge of a
          clearing.
                         
                          COOPER
           Careful. There's some kind of
           underground facility here. We
           might...
                         
          Cooper notices his son is frozen, staring at something:
                         
          Standing bolt upright in the middle of the clearing, wearing
          an old straw hat, is an eight-foot-tall military spec ROBOT.
                         
                          MURPH
           Is it still... alive?
                         
                          COOPER
           Can't be. It's a marine. Haven't
           made them for thirty years. I've
           never seen one intact before.
                         
          Cooper steps closer to the robot, which is frozen. Its alloy
          frame heavily tarnished and weather-beaten. It looks like
          it might have been standing here for decades.
           28.
                         
          Cooper moves closer to it, looking into its blackened eyes.
          He steps back, clearly a little spooked.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           I think we need to go, Murph.
                         
                          MURPH
           But can't we take it back? You could
           fix it up, get him to do chores.
                         
                          COOPER
           No. I don't know what this place
           is, but we're leaving.
                         
          Murph, ignoring his father, steps forward to touch the robot.
                         
          Suddenly, the robot SPRINGS into action, picking up the boy
          and hoisting him up to eye level.
                         
          Cooper, stunned, points the rifle at the robot.
                         
          The robot turns, dropping the boy, RIPS the rifle from
          Cooper's hands, BENDS it, then SLAMS him up against the side
          of the water tank. Cooper punches him, then winces in agony.
                         
          Murph picks up the rifle and begins HITTING the robot as
          hard as he can. The robot opens his mouth and addresses
          Cooper calmly in the clipped tones of a US marine.

          Brand's Father is sitting at a desk, examining the corrupted
          data on the probe. Tars is helping him.
                         
          Brand's Father looks up from the screen as Cooper walks up.

           your company all the way to Mars.
                         
          Tars hands him a plastic waterproof case.
                         
                          TARS
           You will. My chassis is too heavy
           for the rocket stage. They have
           another one waiting for me in orbit.
                         
          Tars turns his back to Cooper. Two flaps on the back of his
          torso slide open, revealing his control module.

          His voice cuts out as Cooper removes the chip and seals it
          in the briefcase.
                         
          Brand's Father resumes exploring the chaos of ones and zeroes
          on the probe's memory. Cooper watches.
                         
                          BRAND'S FATHER
           It's noise. I know it's noise. But
           it looks too orderly. Probably just
           an old man seeing things.

           I won't.
                         
          Cooper looks at her, confused. As he does, the entire rocket
          SHAKES as the primary rockets begin to fire.

          Brand wipes her tears away and settles into the same fearless
          mask she usually wears. She steals one last look out the
          window at Earth, then looks back.
                         
          Cooper begins to say something, but stops as the entire rocket
          LURCHES as the primary engines FIRE.

          Murph watches a tiny vapor trail as it races for the heavens.

          As they get closer, he makes out a looming matte black
          structure that passes light from the stars directly through.
                         
          In the center of the structure, Cooper can see a globe-like
          ship covered in the same refractive material: the ENDURANCE.

          comfortable in the zero gravity environment than the humans,
          hauls himself through.
                         
          They are greeted by a group of robots painted in the same
          material as the ship -- the engineers who built and have
          maintained the Endurance for thirty years.
                         
          INT. MACHINE SHOP, SPACE STATION
                         
          One of the robots leads Cooper through a long lab-like room
          filled with machines capable of fabricating almost anything
          imaginable. Cooper looks like a kid in a candy store.
                         
          The robot reaches a vacuum-sealed package. Cuts it open,
          revealing a bipedal frame.
                         
          Cooper begins LAUGHING -- Tar's new body is beautifully
          designed, but tiny, only about four feet tall.

           Oh, no. I want to see this.
                         
          Cooper takes Tars's chip out of its plastic safety case and
          looks it over. The engineer opens a bay in the back of the
          frame and Cooper slides the chip inside.
                         
          The frame begins its "handshake" -- lights illuminate on the
          body, muscles flicker from a long gestation. The eyes open.

          Tars takes one or two steps forward, rotating his arms --
          the robot equivalent of a stretch. Cooper can barely hide
          his mirth at Tars's newfound lack of stature.

           Bit of a demotion.
                         
          Tars turns back toward Cooper. He puffs out his chest and
          suddenly his stubby arms and legs telescope, unfolding into
          long, svelte limbs. When he's done he stands eight feet
          tall, even more impressive than his earthbound frame.
                         
                          TARS

          Then nothing.

          point in the middle of the cabin.

          appear, as if they've been summoned by the first.
                         
          Some of the points twist, some of them spin, and some of
          them are motionless.

           No. I don't think it's in our
           universe at all. I think it lives
           in the bulk -- the space that the
           wormholes traverse. And it can only
           interact with us using gravity.
                         
          The shape playfully grows around Cooper's hand, bending the
          space it's in, stretching the skin.
                         
          Doyle GASPS as the sphere nearest him moves through his body,
          coming to rest in the middle and bending his entire torso
          like a fun house mirror.
                         
          Suddenly, the sphere wrapped around Cooper's hand begins
          moving, tugging him gently through the cabin.
                         
          In the next moment, all three of them are being propelled
          through the cabin.
                         
          It's a magical moment -- a communion, a dance between
          creatures on either side of a massive, invisible wall.
                         
          Doyle exclaims like a kid on a roller coaster as he is whirled
          around the room.
           127.
                         
          Cooper and Brand collide with each other for a second as the
          bulk beings move them through space. They hold onto each
          other for a moment and then are pulled apart again as the
          whirling dance continues.
                         
          Even the fractal creature is involved -- inside its cage, a
          tiny distortion ripples its fractal skin. The creature breaks
          apart and plays with the distortion around its enclosure.
                         
          Finally, Brand disengages from the dance and pulls herself
          around the lab, looking for some way to try to communicate
          with the creatures.
                         
          She finds two heavy pieces of engineering equipment and moves
          them close to each other, then far apart.
                         
          The bulk beings soon join her, mimicking the motion of the
          pieces of equipment.

          She pull a bag of ball bearings out of a storage bin and
          tears the bag open, releasing a cloud of the tiny shining
          globes into the air.
                         
          For a moment, nothing happens. Then, the distortions begin
          moving through the bearings, shifting them, rearranging them
          into patterns in the air.
                         
          First, they rearrange the ball bearings into clusters, then
          shapes spinning around each other -- planets orbiting around
          a medium-sized star.

          After a moment the ball bearings break apart again and
          rearrange into a larger, more complicated system -- Gargantua,
          Pantagruel, and the ice planet.
                         
          Finally, the bearings compress to a two-dimensional sheet.
          Inside the sheet, one solitary ball bearing orbits around
          the stars and then pushes up, off of the sheet, into an
          umbrella shaped space that rises up from the sheet.

          unbuckles himself.
                         
          Cooper stands and walks over to the probe. Traces the
          familiar stars and stripes carved into its side.

          mouth that the Chinese have dropped down to a lower gravity
          well, creating a time machine.

          Murph, now in his 40s, is putting the finishing touches on a
          large machine. Although slightly different, we recognize
          some of the components and their configuration:
                         
          It's a crude version of the gravitational device.
                         
          Murph double checks it, then fires up a small gas powered
          generator. Throws a breaker, feeding power to the unit.
                         
          The unit lights up. HUMS. But nothing happens.

          Murph, disappointed but undaunted, shuts it down and begins

          Murph puts an arm around his daughter and as they watch, the
          entire barn IMPLODES. Their tractor begins sliding towards
          the wreckage of the barn, chunky tires plowing up the soil.

          Unchecked by trees or vegetation, the wind rockets through
          the house, blasting Cooper and pelting what's left of the
          structure with fist-sized hail.
                         
          Cooper takes shelter against the remaining wall. He's going
          to have to sit this one out -- the hail and winds are the
          brutal descendants of the weather he knew. They'll finish
          him off if he steps back outside.

          a few more steps, then stumbles again, spent.

          Cooper takes a final step. Finally, he collapses under his
          ship, as the wind continues to HOWL around him.

          Cooper hovers at the back of the room, unsure. He turns to
          the doctor, questioning. Then he notices the pictures on
          the old man's desk:
                         
          There are dozens of them. Children, grandchildren. Then
          the older ones -- the man's own parents. Grandparents.
          Cooper spots a tiny framed picture with someone he recognizes:
                         
          Murph, 80 years old, surrounded by his daughter and her
          family. They are standing in front of a re-opened Cape
          Canaveral, and a huge spaceship under construction.
                         
          Cooper picks up the picture and stares at it.
                         
          The doctor points to a shy little boy hiding behind Murph's
          leg in the picture.

          Cooper's eyes well with tears. He steps over to the bed and
          looks down at the ancient man, teetering on the edge of death.
                         
          The old man looks at him, eyes widening in excitement. He
          strains, trying to reach the bedside table. He's trying to
          reach the drawer. Cooper helps him open it.
                         
          Inside is a simple, familiar wristwatch. The old man
          carefully takes out the watch. He gives the watch a few
          winds and, hands shaking, offers it to Cooper.
                         
          Cooper, eyes filling with tears, closes his hand over the
