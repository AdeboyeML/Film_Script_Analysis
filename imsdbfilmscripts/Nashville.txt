1	CLOSE SHOT - SIGN

	Nashville Airport.

2	EXT. NASHVILLE AIRPORT - DAY

	TRICYCLE MAN drives into parking lot and parks next to GREEN'S 
	old Chevy. TRICYCLE MAM: locks his machine and walks toward 
	coffee shop. GREEN gets out of his car, locks it, starts in the 
	same direction. NORMAN parks the limo, goes into main building.

3	INT. AIRPORT - DAY

	NORMAN is attracted to large CONNIE WHITE display.

4	INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

	At the entrance is another "CONNIE WHITE" display and from the 
	jukebox we hear one of her songs.

	The waitress, SUELEEN, drops a fork, then gets another from an 
	overflowing sink and hands it to her customer, TRICYCLE MAN.

	There are several people at the counter with him, including 
	GREEN, who has just walked in. Another man enters, DELBERT 
	REESE. SUELEEN waits on all of them.

	A small black man comes out of the kitchen, carrying a tray full 
	or dishes. This is WADE.

					WADE
				(to SUELEEN)
			You want a ride into town?

					SUELEEN
			You bet.

	REESE looks up, checking out SUELEEN, then WADE, then the 
	TRICYCLE MAN, then his breast pocket to see it his wallet and 
	checkbook are still there, then he buries himself in his 
	newspaper.

					SUELEEN
			Got me an audition tonight.

					WADE
			Well, you just remember, if you 
			can't kick front, kick back, 'cause 
			at least you're kicking... Ten 
			minutes, okay?

	She nods and talks to the TRICYCLE MAN. REESE keeps sneaking 
	looks at her.

					SUELEEN
			I've just been waiting for the 
			right spot to sing in... I'm so 
			nervous...

	She laughs and starts to rinse the dishes in the sink.

					SUELEEN
			I'm good, though. There ain't but 
			one Sueleen Gay -- I don't mean to 
			be conceited, but really it's true. 
			I've been taking special coaching 
			lessons from Zeke Willard -- he's 
			just wonderful. Teaches you how to 
			phrase; that's really important. 
			And breathing. Well, you know all 
			about that. Anyway, I wrote this 
			song.

	She looks down and then begins to half whisper, sing, and half do 
	all of the gestures for a song she has written as she wipes some 
	glasses. The jukebox continues to play CONNIE WHITE, and every 
	time someone walks by, Sueleen stops. She finally gets through 
	the song and discovers REESE has been watching, too. She looks 
	away from him to the TRICYCLE MAN, who smiles. Be has finished 
	his meal.

					SUELEEN
			Oh, listen, I really do go on. 
			Here's your check. Sure has been 
			nice talking to you.

	As she removes her apron, a HAVEN HAMILTON song comes on the 
	jukebox, "Keep on a goin'."  The TRICYCLE MAN leaves.

	CUT TO:

5	INT. CONTROL BOOTH - NASHVILLE STUDIO - DAY

	We hear the last chorus or "Keep on a goin'" as sung by HAVEN, 
	who is recording.

	He is always dressed in white. In the booth are BUD and LADY 
	PEARL. Also present are two engineers and a producer. HAVEN is 
	accompanied by a long haired piano player with a white sweater. 
	HAVEN is not too happy with him. 

6	ANOTHER ANGLE

	OPAL enters the booth, carrying a too-large English tape 
	recorder. HAVEN Stops singing, mad at OPAL'S interruption and 
	the piano player. Through the glass we see him pantomiming 
	instructions for her to leave. As she does, HAVEN starts over.

7	INT. HALLWAY - DAY

	OPAL wanders to the next studio. BUD follows, apologizing.

					BUD
			Sorry. He sees a tape recorder and 
			gets upset.

	She looks at him.

					BUD
			He's my father.

					OPAL
			Haven Hamilton is your father? Can 
			you arrange an interview?

8	INT. SECOND RECORDING BOOTH - DAY

	They have entered a different control tooth. In the recording 
	portion, LINNEA and an all-black, male CHOIR sings a gospel song. 
	OPAL asks BUD who this group is.

9	INT. FIRST CONTROL BOOTH - DAY

	BUD returns. HAVEN has just exploded at the piano player and 
	starts to leave, yelling at the producer.

					HAVEN
			Who the hell is playing piano? Get 
			that hippie out of here... He's got 
			a tin ear. I asked for Pig, dammit. 
			I'm moving on 'cause I gotta get to 
			the airport. When you get my 
			backups straight, then we'll talk 
			about cutting this tune here.

	He heads for the hallway.

10	INT. HALLWAY - DAY

	It is jammed with black singers from the CHOIR. HAVEN hates 
	being crushed and moves through the congestion like a white 
	knight. OPAL moves near.

					OPAL
			Excuse me, sir. I'm here putting 
			together a film. I would like to 
			ask some questions.

	She has to fumble with the bulky tape machine and transformer.

					HAVEN
			Foreigner?

					OPAL
			I'm from BBC television.

					HAVEN
			Where the hell is that?

	HAVEN nod a politely and leaves the crowded hallway with BUD and 
	PEARL. He spots LINNEA.

					HAVEN
			Linnea.

					LINNEA
			How you doing, Haven?

					HAVEN
			oh, fine. Couldn't be better.

11	ANGLE T0WARD OUTSIDE

	They all say goodbye and HAVEN'S group gets into a new white jeep

	CUT TO:

12	EXT. AIRPORT - DAY

	Barbara Jean's plane taxis to a halt.

13	INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

	REESE leaves a tip and exits the coffee shop to greet the plane.

	Page Missing

14A	CONTINUED:

	TOM spots stews and goes to them

					TOM
			You ladies got room for a spare?

					STEW
			Sure.

14B	NEW ANGLE

	L.A. JOAN is left in the dust.

					L.A. JOAN
			'Bye... nice talking to you.

	GREEN sees his niece and walks over.

					GREEN
			Joan?

	She turns.

					L.A. JOAN
			Did you see who that was?

					GREEN
			Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, 
			too.

					L.A. JOAN 
			He is just wonderful.

					GREEN
			I'1l get your bag.

	CUT TO:

15	EXT. LANDING AREA - AIRPORT - DAY

	GLENN has just deposited a postcard in a mailbox and approaches a 
	gathering cluster of people. NORMAN and TRICYCLE MAN are nearby. 
	Everybody is waiting for BARBARA JEAN to appear. GLENN steps 
	close to NORMAN.

					GLENN
			Am I late?

					NORMAN
			Late!  Oh, Jesus!

	He runs off.

16	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As NORMAN runs toward passenger loading, we see HAVEN'S jeep 
	arrive with HAVEN, BUD and PEARL. It parks and all climb out. 
	REESE and TRIPLETTE approach the 'Barbara Jean' plane. BARNETT 
	is already on the runway, making arrangements. HAVEN'S group all 
	shake hands.

					HAVEN
			Delbert, how are you?

					REESE
			I'm fine. This here is John 
			Triplette. Triplette, like you to 
			meet the Honorary Mayor, Haven 
			Hamilton.

					HAVEN
			Good to meet you.
				 (turns to BUD)
			Bud, have them move the horses.

					TRIPLETTE
			Pleasure 

					REESE
			Where is she?

					HAVEN
			Still inside the plane posing for 
			pictures and signing autographs. 
			She's got a new album cut again. 
			She'll be down in a minute. But 
			she'll be late for the Opera if she 
			doesn't hurry. Bud, get the plane on 
			the walkie-talkie.

	BUD fumbles on his walkie-talkie telephone, but can't seem to get 
	anything.

					BUD
			They don't seem to be answering. 
			The ambulance boys are here, though. 
			Barnett always expects them to get 
			there like a shot. That thing only 
			goes a hundred fall bore with the 
			sirens going.

					HAVEN
			Thank you, Bud.

	BUD nods like he has been complimented.

17	ANGLE TOWARD PLANE

	A wave of noise begins from the fans. The band and majorettes 
	and horses and ropers go into a rendition of one of her hit tunes 
	as BARBARA JEAN appears. Everyone is breaking their neck to see, 
	especially GLENN. HAVEN and REESE give her the first round of 
	applause, then go back to talking. TRIPLETTE has never been 
	exposed to anything quite like this before and stands a little in 
	awe of the situation.

	When the twirling and tricking and music stop, BARBARA JEAN 
	descends the stairs.

					HAVEN
			Bud, tell them to move the horses. 
			Promised this strip would be spic 
			and span.

	He smiles and winks.

					REESE
			Listen, we'll go get the car and 
			come back. This'l1 be going on for 
			a while.

					HAVEN
			You bet. She's probably talking to 
			somebody about their sick child. You 
			know how she is.

	They wave goodbye and head in the direction of the loading zone. 
	Behind them, the horse people disperse and get into their cars 
	and horse trailers, preparing to return to Nashville.

18	ANOTHER ANGLE

	BARNETT comes over to REESE, TRIPLETTE, HAVEN, BUD and PEARL 
	while BARBARA JEAN continues to greet fans.

19	EXT. AIRPORT NEAR PARKING LOT - DAY

	While the BARBARA JEAN arrival takes place on the runway NORMAN 
	finds BILL and MARY. NORMAN speaks softly and out of breath, 
	trying to pretend he's on time.

					NORMAN
			Hi.

	BILL slaps him on the back and engulfs him.

					BILL
			Hi, Norman.

	NORMAN looks relieved. BILL and MARY have been arguing.

					NORMAN
			Sure is nice to see you all again. 
			I never thought I'd see you again 
			after the last time.

					BILL
			Oh, Norman, you worry too much.

	MARY takes NORMAN'S hand.

					MARY
			Norman, how are you?

	She kisses him and he blushes. BILL and MARY are glad to talk to 
	someone else.

					NORMAN
			Fine. Just fine.

	As they walk to the limo, we see a car with loudspeakers on top 
	of it and clearly written door signs that read: "Replacement 
	Party" in red, white and blue. REESE and TILIPLETTE are walking 
	toward it, shaking hands with several people.

					NORMAN
			Sure have missed you all, though. 
			Oh, where's Tom?  Isn't he with you?

					BILL
			Don't worry about old Tom.

20	ANOTHER ANGLE

	TOM and the stews walk to a VW with a sun roof.

	Nearby REESE and TRIPLETTE get into their Cadillac, behind it the 
	Replacement Party car. Coming from the loudspeakers a tape-
	recorded VOICE:

					VOICE
			Have you thought about your future 
			and what America needs to examine...

	Behind the Replacement Party car is an airport bus with "Connie 
	White" posters on the side. GLENN is one or the passengers. He 
	cranes his neck to continue watching the runway and BARBARA JEAN.

21	EXT. PARKING LOT

	NORMAN'S limo, with BILL and MARY, follows traffic as the 
	TRICYCLE MAN fires up his machine. WADE'S car with SUELEEN also 
	joins the procession.

22	ANGLE TOWARD RUNWAY

	The orange ambulance has moved into the area near the plane and 
	there seems to be a great deal at activity.

	REESE and TRIPLETTE'S car stops, and they rush out and run into 
	HAVEN, who is shouting for people to get the hell out of the way.

23	NEW ANGLE

	Two ambulance ATTENDANTS cut through the crowd. HAVEN, TRIPLETTE 
	and REESE rush near. BARNETT is on his knees over BARBARA JEAN, 
	who has collapsed. The ATTENDANTS lean over her with ammonia. 
	They test her reflexes, etc..

					ATTENDANT
			How long was she out?

					BARNETT
			Not too long. But she keeps 
			passing out.

	She comes to and looks at them all.

					BARBARA JEAN
				 (oblivious)
			Just give your manna that vitamin 
			E. Makes a world of difference.

					HAVEN
			Here she is again.

	She resists the ammonia, looks around and passes out again.

					ATTENDANT
			Okay, let's get her to the wagon.

	A stretcher is brought in and she is placed under oxygen. BARNETT 
	climbs into the ambulance with BARBARA JEAN, slamming the door on 
	DELBERT and TRIPLETTE. HAVEN stands there, yelling at people. 
	DELBERT and TRIPLETTE rush back to their car as the ambulance 
	speeds off, siren wailing.

24	EXT. FREEVAY TO NASHVILLE - DAY

25	TRICYCLE MAN

	leads the procession.

26	INT. GREEN'S CAR

					GREEN
			Eater's been asking for you.

	L.A. JOAN is trying to find a station she likes on her transistor 
	radio.

					L.A. JOAN
			Uh huh.

					GREEN
			She's been in the hospital two 
			weeks yesterday.

	L.A. JOAN can't find anything she likes. 

					L.A. JOAN
			You know anything about the 
			stations here?

					GREEN
				 (hasn't heard) 
			It's hard to say. Doctors thought 
			she'd come home a week ago. All it 
			was was appendix.

					L.A. JOAN
			All they got is advertisements. 
			Just like L.A.

					GREEN
			Did an exploratory and according to 
			them, she needed an overhaul.

	He chuckles at his prepared joke.

					L.A. JOAN
			Well, I could use one, especially 
			if I'm pregnant.

					GREEN
			What did you say?

					L.A. JOAN
			I said, maybe I'll change my name 
			again.

					GREEN
			I see... Well, those doctors are 
			real miracle workers.

					L.A. JOAN
			But not unless Nashville really 
			inspires me.

					GREEN
			Maybe you can look after me a 
			little.

					L.A. JOAN
			That Tom sure is cute.

29	INT. HAVEN'S JEEP

					PEARL
			We had these two city boys come in 
			last week. One or them said his 
			Ford truck had cut off his foot. 
			The other one said that wasn't true. 
			Then the first said he looked just 
			like Eddie Black when he said 
			that...

					HAVEN
			Bud, would you be sure to get the 
			oil changed?

					BUD
			Ya... where do you want me to take 
			it?

					PEARL
			Do you remember Eddie Black? He had 
			those blue eyes.

					HAVEN
			Where you always take it. There's 
			nothing special about this time.

					PEARL
			And they started pounding on each 
			other. But the one without the foot 
			was strongest.

					HAVEN
			Bud, you're going to have to show 
			up at the hospital tar me I gotta 
			get back to that session.

					BUD
			Okay. Anything you want me to say?

					HAVEN
			Say I had to get back to the 
			session. ~ God -- All school did 
			for you, you can put in a thimble.

					PEARL
			The cops came through and broke it 
			up. I finally just had to call Chet 
			and say, 'Chet, get over here. There 
			are two old bays here breaking up 
			the furniture...'

	CUT TO:

30	INT. WADE'S CAR-TRUCK

	SUELEEN in doing some vocal exercising. WADE listens for awhile.

					WADE
			Is that what you're going to sing?

	She laughs.

					SUELEEN
			No -- That's exercises. My coach 
			says you have to do exercise because 
			the vocal chords are muscle and need 
			to be stretched. Every time you 
			stretch them, the middle part sets 
			stronger. That's the place where I 
			sing.

					WADE
			You think I got any kind of a 
			voice?

	He breaks into a scale.

					SUELEEN
			You sure do it loud.

					WADE
			Is that good?

					SUELEEN
			It's not bad.

					WADE
			You think I should take lessons?

					SUELEEN
			If you're serious. Being serious 
			is real important.

					WADE
			You serious?

					SUELEEN
			Wade -- I've been working toward 
			this audition for years.

					WADE
			Well, honey, I sure hope it comes 
			your way then.

					SUELEEN
			You think it will?

					WADE
			Sure thing.

					TOM
			You did, huh?

					STEW #1
			Ya - I even recognized them.

					STEW #2
			How long have you been together?

					TOM
				 (laughing)
			Too long.

					STEW #3
			Is your rather really an actor?

					TOM
				 (laughing)
			All his life.

					STEW #3
			Really?

					TOM
			Me, too.

	They all laugh. STEW #4 has been driving over-cautiously because 
	of the cargo. TOM leans over and kisses her ear.

					TOM
			You having any fun?

	She shrieks and practically drives off the road. They all laugh.

					TOM
			That's the most important thing --
			to have -- fun 

					STEW #2
			How long are you going to be here?

					TOM
			Long enough to have fun.

	They laugh.

					TRIPLETTE
			What do you think of him?

					REESE
			Hal? Well, Hal and I have been 
			friends for a long time.

					TRIPLETTE
			You go to school together?

					REESE
			No, we never did that

					TRIPLETTE
			Oh --

					REESE
			We're connected by a relative. One 
			time, one of his aunts married one 
			of my uncles. That was a long time 
			ago, though. How'd you come to work 
			for him?

					TRIPLETTE
			Well, I really think he's got a 
			chance. 

					REESE
			You do?

					TRIPLETTE
			Oh yea -- There has never been a 
			better time for something new.

					REESE
			He ain't really new.

					TRIPLETTE
			He is to a lot of people.

					REESE
			He was a good Judge, but that was a 
			long time ago.

					TRIPLETTE
			You know, I'll bet you he makes it 
			with a majority.

					REESE
			Where are you from?

					TRIPLETTE
			Southern California.

					REESE
			You always live there?

					TRIPLETTE
			Spent time in Arizona. Why?

					REESE
			Well, I admire your optimism, and I 
			just wondered if it was regional. 
			You ever see any movie stars?

					TRIPLETTE
			I know a couple.

					REESE
			No kidding -- Wait till I tell 
			Linnea. Who?

					TRIPLETTE
			Ah... Peter Finch.

					REESE
			Who?

					TRIPLETTE
			Peter Finch -- he's English.

					REESE
			I never heard of him. Name 
			somebody else.

					TRIPLETTE
			Ryan O'Neal.

					REESE
			You really do?  ~ God -- How come 
			you know them?

					TRIPLETTE
			Oh, you meet them at parties and 
			stuff.

					REESE
			I'll be damned. Boy, if you could 
			get Ryan to say something about Hal 
			Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be 
			something?

					TRIPLETTE
			Well -- maybe. Let's see what 
			happens here.

35	INT. LINNEA'S CAR

	Joining the procession from an auxiliary route. With her is 
	OPAL, who interviews LINNEA.

					OPAL
			Have your children been deaf since 
			birth?

					LINNEA
			Yes -- yes, they have. It was a 
			real shock at first, especially 
			since my daddy's a preacher, but 
			Delbert and I have been blessed by 
			their being here.

					OPAL
			When did you start singing?

					LINNEA
			When I was little, in church.

					OPAL
			Isn't it unusual for you to be 
			working with a black choir?

					LINNEA
			Yes, it is --

					OPAL
			Well, can you tell me why?

					LINNEA
			It just is.

					OPAL
				 (not getting the 
				 answer she wants)
			How long have you been with them?

					LINNEA
			About three years.

					OPAL
			And before?

					LINNEA
			Just my church and my boys. We all 
			had to go to school and learn hand 
			talking. I just thank the Lord they 
			can see.

					OPAL
			Do you ever do any writing?

					LINNEA
			No, I don't.

					OPAL
			Are you a close friend of Haven's?

					LINNEA
			No, mostly his wife's. She's in 
			Paris, France, right now. My 
			husband Delbert is real friendly 
			with him. Delbert's in law. Does 
			work for him.

					OPAL
			Do you like him?

					LINNEA
			He's a member of our congregation.

					STAR
			You got the money?

			Right here.

					STAR
			Well, don't lose it. Last time I 
			gave you twenty-five dollars, you 
			lost it.

					ALBUQUERQUE
			Well, that just happened that time.

					STAR
			Well, it better not happen again.

	ALBUQUERQUE turns and looks out the window. They ride in 
	resentful silence.

					STAR
			You lost twenty-five dollars once 
			before that, too, near Christmas 
			time -- I remember that real well 
			now. December 9th, to be exact.

					ALBUQUERQUE
			You got a real good memory, Star.

					STAR
			I remember when I just saw you. 
			Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were 
			skinny.

					ALBUQUERQUE
				 (ignoring him)
			What do you have to buy?

					STAR
			Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get 
			something for the kids.

					ALBUQUERQUE
			Okay by me - I'd sure like to see 
			that Opryland.

					STAR
			What?

					ALBUQUERQUE
			Grand Old Opera --

					STAR
			I hate that music.

					ALBUQUERQUE
			I know that, Star.

	CUT TO:

38	EXT. FREEWAY

	Near a bridge, a huge diesel truck almost collides with the 
	Replacement car, which has just made a greedy move.

	To avoid collision, the diesel jackknifes, blocking all traffic 
	behind it, except for one narrow lane.

39	INT. LIMO

	MARY sits erect.

					NORMAN
			Oh, my God!

	BILL climbs out.

					BILL
			Norman, just sit there and don't 
			puke.

	He runs toward the truck. At this point, the TRICYCLE MAN 
	appears through all the cars.

40	ANGLE AT BRIDGE

	The TRICYCLE MAN works his way through traffic. STAR has climbed 
	from his truck and goes to help. ALBUQUESQUE takes advantage and 
	runs off.

41	ANGLE NEAR KENNY'S CAR

	It overheats and explodes. KENNY gets out, carrying his violin 
	case and starts to walk. ALBUQUERQUE spots him and steps near.

					ALBUQUERQUE
			Hey, mind if I walk with ya?

	She looks at his violin case.

					ALBUQUERQUE
			You a musician?

					KENNY
			No.

					ALBUQUERQUE
			Do you have people in Nashville?

					KENNY
			No -- Just coming to Nashville, 
			that's all.

42	INT. AMBULANCE

	BARNETT is in a rage. The ATTENDANTS administer oxygen to 
	BARBARA JEAN

					BARNETT
			I don't care. I pay you people 
			twenty-five bucks an hour and keep 
			you working steady. Now either go on 
			or turn around. But move.

43	EXT. HIGHWAY

	The ambulance passes all the vehicles, including the horse rigs. 
	As he passes NORMAN'S limo:

					MARY
			Don't worry, Norman. There's no 
			blood. Nobody's hurt.

	She climbs out of the car and moves to the freeway rail and yells 
	for some workmen below to call the police.

44	ANGLE AT DIESEL

	The driver is hurt badly. TRICYCLE MAN and STAR are there. STAR 
	looks up, relieved an ambulance is coming. His face drops as the 
	ambulance speeds past and toward the city.

45	ANGLE FURTHER BACK IN TRAFFIC

	ALBUQUERQUE is walking with KENNY. She sees STAR returning to 
	his truck. She ducks into the ivy.

					ALBUQUERQUE
			Hurt my foot...

	STAR approaches his truck, sees ALBUQUERQUE is gone and spots 
	KSNNY.

					STAR

47	INT. BAPTIST HOSPITAL - AFTERNOON

	BARBARA JEAN is in bed. A DOCTOR is there, along with a crowd of 
	publicity people and well-wishers, including: TRIPLETTE, REESE, 
	BUD. BARNETT hovers over BARBARA JEAN. The atmosphere is 
	stifling.

					DOCTOR
			Barbara, I'd like to talk to you 
			and Barnett alone.

					BARNETT
			Anything you say.

	He turns to the visitors.

					BARNETT
			Doctor says you'll have to go on 
			out now

	There are tones of disappointment, most of them are very involved 
	in their own conversations. TRIPLETTE walks toward the bed, but 
	can't really get close enough. He finally captures BARNETT as 
	the people start to leave.

					TRIPLETTE
			Excuse me, Barnett, how's she 
			doing?

	BARNETT turns and studies him for a moment as though he remembers 
	who he is. He doesn't.

					TRIPLETTE
			I'm sorry. I feel as if I know you. 
			I'm John Triplette... a friend of 
			Del Reese... I was at the airport. 
			I just wanted to introduce myself. 
			I'm a great fan of hers. If there's 
			anything you need, just give me a 
			call. I'm at the Sheraton South.

					BARNETT
			She's going to rest now.

					TRIPLETTE
			Okay, I just wanted to see if I 
			could help out at all.

	The crowd is almost out of the room now. We see GLENN there as he 
	steps into the hallway.

					BARNETT
			I appreciate your concern, but she 
			has to rest, so you can go on home.

					TRIPLETTE
			Oh, sure.

	He stands there too long.

					BARNETT
			What do you really want?

					TRIPLETTE
			Not a thing, Barnett, really. I 
			need a little information. But, ah, 
			it can wait.

					BARNETT
			You bet.

					TRIPLETTE
			Okay. Thanks.

	BARNETT says "you bet" again and closes the door after TRIPLETTE. 
	BARNETT returns to the bed with BARBARA JEAN and the DOCTOR.

					DOCTOR
			Well, it's exhaustion, pure and 
			simple, and you're going to have to 
			take a rest or you're going to be in 
			big trouble.

					BARNETT
			She has to be at the opera tomorrow 
			night and then she can go home.

					DOCTOR
			She's not going anywhere, Barnett. 
			This is precisely what I'm talking 
			about. She is collapsing. She 
			cannot go on without a rest or she 
			will have to stop altogether for a 
			long time.

					BARBARA JEAN
			Well, I have to go:  It's too late 
			to be replaced, and, besides, I just 
			can't do that. Those people get 
			disappointed. They've come in from 
			all over, you know, and this Miss 
			Foxy who's been writing to me for 
			years is going to be there from 
			Michigan.

					DOCTOR
			You cannot leave this bed until I 
			say so. The two of you have to 
			understand that. Barnett, you've 
			got to stop this dovetailing and 
			give her some rest. You don't need 
			to make that much more money.

					BARNETT
			It's not the money. The friends 
			and neighbors love her and they want 
			to see her. We got a debt to the 
			public.

					DOCTOR
			Well, they are not going to see her 
			tomorrow night, and I suggest you 
			get on the phone and make the 
			necessary arrangements.

			Barbara Jean who is in the Baptist 
			Hospital. She collapsed yesterday 
			morning at the plane christening. 
			Send your prayers and letters to 
			Baptist Hospital, Nashville, 
			Tennessee. Barnett said she wept 
			because she couldn't be here with 
			you friends and neighbors. But your 
			faith in the great Almighty will 
			bring her back here just to be what 
			you want her to be... And her good 
			friend, Connie White, has given up 
			some time with her own mother, who 
			is sick with a kidney disorder, to 
			fill in and send her warmth to you 
			wonderful friends and neighbors so 
			you won't be too disappointed after 
			this message from teeth-sticken, 
			good, gooey clusters.

94	ANGLE TOWARD GLENN

	GLENN politely leaves when CONNIE WHITE is announced. The 
	TRICYCLE MAN takes his seat, next to L.A. JOAN.

95	INT. OPERA - ANGLE BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

	ALBUQUERQUE talks to two POLICEMEN.

					ALBUQUERQUE
			I know it's here somewhere. I had 
			it when I walked in, but you weren't 
			here. My name's Albuquerque, and 
			I'm here cutting a record. My 
			people said it would be all right.

	POLICEMAN
	Sorry, miss. No pass, no entrance. Your people should have given 
	you a pass.

					ALBUQUERQUE
			They did. I know I'll find it 
			here.

	We HEAR HAVEN'S VOICE from the stage.

96	NEW ANGLE

	CONNIE WHITE passes ALBUQUERQUE and the POLICEMEN on her way to 
	the bathroom. ALBUQUERQUE rushes up.

					ALBUQUERQUE
			Sister Connie... Connie. Hi, I saw 
			you out there. I just think you're 
			so beautiful. What do you think?  I 
			can't find my pass. I'm here 
			cutting a record, you know, and 
			these policemen here...

	The POLICEMEN standing right behind her. They all know she is 
	lying.

					CONNIE
			I'm so glad you come for a little 
			while, and thank you.

					ALBUQUERQUE
			I could just sit where I was. I 
			wasn't bothering anybody. That guy 
			asking everybody questions made more 
			noise than I ever did. You saw me 
			there. You signed this program.

	A MAN walks into the group.

					MAN
			Miss Connie, you're next.

	CONNIE smiles and squeezes ALBUQUERQUE'S hand.

					CONNIE
			Oh, honey, I gotta go. Thanks for 
			coming. You read what I wrote you 
			now.

					ALBUQUERQUE
			I did. You said, 'your friend, 
			Connie.'

	CONNIE has disappeared and the POLICE start to usher out 
	ALBUQUERQUE. She tries to see and hear as:

	SUELEEN is in her mirror applying a whole face based upon the 
	stars of the forties. She is listening to the OPERA ON the RADIO 
	and eating pork and beans and tuna from cans. Her room is tilled 
	with photographs of herself and Catholic symbols. She goes to 
	the closet and selects a gown. She is preparing an outfit and 
	face for the benefit.

101	INT. BAPTIST HOSPITAL - BAAHARA JEAN'S ROOM

	We HEAR the tail end of CONNIE WHITE'S SONG on the radio. BARNETT 
	is intently listening.

					BARBARA JEAN
			Would you turn that off

	He continues to listen until the end.

					BARBARA JEAN 
			Barnett, please -

					BARNETT
			What's wrong honey.

					BARBARA JEAN
			I don't want to listen to her sing 
			-

					BARNETT
			Don't feel that way, honey.

					BARBARA JEAN
			Then why are you listening to her -

					BARNETT
			Well, I have to go thank her for 
			filling in and it's nice to know the 
			tune she sang.

					BARBARA JEAN
			You have to what?

					BARNETT
			Go to the King Of the Road and 
			thank her.

	BARBARA JEAN gets up out of bed.

					BARBARA JEAN
			Well here, why don't you take her 
			some of these flowers while you're 
			at it.

	She begins pulling flowers from various vases.

					BARBARA JEAN
			Maybe you'd like to work out 
			something with her, too... Split us 
			up... Her on the road and me in town 
			or in the hospital --
				 (she wails)
			Barnett!

	She sits down on the floor at the foot of the bed and begins to 
	cry. BARNETT backs off. If she was hoping for understanding, 
	she is not about to receive it.

					BARNETT
			What the hell is wrong with you?  
			Huh?

	He bends down and looks at her with the eyes of a race horse 
	owner whose investment Just collapsed in the stretch.

					BARNETT
			Wait a minute. You're not going 
			nutsey on me, are you?  Huh...? 
			You're not going to have one of 
			those nervous breakdowns or 
			anything, are you?

	Afraid she has gone too far, BARBARA JEAN stops crying and tries 
	to make everything all right. But she is still choking in her 
	own panic of being left.

					BARBARA JEAN
			A... No... No, I'm just... I'm 
			really fine... I just.
				 (she gets up)
			don't want you to think I'm giving 
			up or anything like that...

	BARNETT looks at her as if from now on he will suspect her of 
	secretly being crazy. He begins to pick up the flowers from the 
	floor.

					BARNETT
			I'll just take these on over to 
			her. Show her your appreciation.

	BARBARA JEAN crawls numbly back into her bed, nodding 
	affirmatively.

					BARBARA JEAN
			Sure... you go on and do that.

	She begins to shiver. BARNETT looks at her, but he makes no 
	attempt to come any closer.

					BARBARA JEAN
				 (very small)
			Barnett?

	He leans in and pats her arm gingerly.

					BARNETT
			I'll tell her thank you, for you.

	BARBARA JEAN nods affirmatively, still shivering.

					BARBARA JEAN
				 (please hold me 
				 voice)
			Barnett?

					BARNETT
			What?

	She senses he can't go any further.

					BARBARA JEAN
			Bye, bye.

	He looks at her again and leaves.

					BARNETT
			Bye. bye.

	He is not out the door before the tears begin again and she turns 
	into her pillow so he won't hear her.

102	INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

	GREEN has come from his wife's room. He sees BARNETT walk down 
	the hall. After a moment's deliberation, GREEN enters BARBARA 
	JEAN'S room.

103	INT. BARBARA JEAN'S ROOM

	We SEE GREEN come in the door. BARBARA JEAN is sti1l trying to 
	control herself, but is not having much luck with it.

					BARBARA JEAN
				 (to the pillow)
			I just get so afraid sometimes. 
			Then I get more afraid. : Just want 
			you to hold me.

	MR. GREEN can't bear what she's saying. He hesitates for a 
	minute and then figures what the hell.

					GREEN
			Hello.

	She freezes, thinking BARNETT has come back and she will be 
	discounted as totally insane.

					GREEN
			Am I disturbing you?

					BARBARA JEAN
			I'm really all right, Barnett. 
			Don't you worry really... I just 
			don't want you to leave me that's 
			all.

	She turns and screams at GREEN.

					BARBARA JEAN
			Oh, my God.

	She scares GREEN, too, but he recovers better.

					GREEN
			Oh, honey, I didn't mean to scare 
			you.

					BARBARA JEAN
			How did you come in here?

					GREEN
			Well, my wife, Ester's down the 
			hall. I saw Barnett leaving and I 
			was just talking to Ester about your 
			being here.	She loves you so much, 
			I just had to come down and say 
			hello. We've been following you 
			since you were a girl. Well, I just 
			scared you to death. I didn't mean 
			to do that.

	She listens to him. The words somehow comfort her and she begins 
	to laugh.

					BARBARA JEAN
			Well, I guess you caught me at a 
			weak moment.

					GREEN
			You'll have to speak up.

	Realizing he can't hear too well makes her feel a little more 
	secure.

					BARBARA JEAN
				 (louder)
			I said, I've been real tired.

					GREEN
			Eater  says she doesn't see how you 
			do it.

					BARBARA JEAN
				 (loudly)
			What's wrong with her.

					GREEN
			Oh just about everything, I guess. 
			Those doctors started on an overhaul 
			and don't want to quit. They keep 
			taking things out. She's going to 
			come home an egg shell. Tough, 
			though.. She's tough.

					BARBARA JEAN
			What did you say your name was?

					GREEN
			Green.

	BARBARA JEAN Well, Mr. Green, you tell those doctors to stop that 
	whittling and get her some Vitamin E. Have her take that three 
	times a day, along with some good meals. If I could cook for 
	her, she'd be well in a minute.

	A NURSE enters.

					NURSE
			Well, Mr. Green.

					GREEN
			Hi, Sherry.

					NURSE
			How'd you get in here.

					BARBARA JEAN
			It's fine. We were just talking 
			about Vitamin S.

					GREEN
			I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.

					BARBARA JEAN
			You remember what I said about the 
			Vitamins.

	She watches as he leaves, sorry to see him go.

			You know goddamn well where she is.

	BARNETT, with the flowers, enters and sits in the lounge. 

107	ANOTHER ANGLE

	It is getting crowded by people returning from the Opera.

	OPAL is on one of the house phones, talking to Paris. We can also 
	HEAR the HOUSE PHONE OPERATOR behind the switchboard desk. OPAL 
	speaks in a combination of English and French. She isn't saying 
	much in one language and she might just be talking to the 
	OPERATOR, but is sounds impressive.

108	NEW ANGLE

	CONNIE WHITE and her group step into the lobby. The MC in the 
	lounge, spots her and coaxes her into taking the stage and 
	singing one of her hits. When she finishes, BARNETT walks up and 
	thanks her, handing her the flowers. Meanwhile, HAVEN, who is 
	there with BUD and PEARL, tells TRIPLETTE that CONNIE and BARBARA 
	JEAN will replace each other, but never appear on the same bill. 
	After BARNETT exits, CONNIE leaves with HAVEN, BUD, PEARL and 
	TRIPLETTE. OPAL is still on the phone, now speaking in Ita1ian.

			Glad to meet you.

			I was wondering if you'd like to be

	BILL lights a cigarette and takes a shot of tequilla out of the 
	bottle on the floor.

					BILL
			What's he running for?

					TRIPLETTE
			President.

					BILL
			When is it?

			Wednesday at the park. We've got a

					BILL
			How much?

					TRIPLETTE
			Minimum.

	MARY looks at BILL.

					MARY
			We can't support him  We're

	BILL begins the fight again.

					BILL
			It's an appearance. It has nothing

			like him.

					MARY
			Bill, he's a crazy man.

	TRIPLETTE moves in fast.

					TRIPLETTE
			Well, he- expressed a particular

	They stop and look at him suspiciously.

			What for?

					TRIPLETTE
			You're real favorites of his.

	They seem to change viewpoints in a moment.

					MARY
			You're kidding.

					BILL
			How come?

	TRIPLETTE settles in like they were old friends.

					TRIPLETTE
			First you have to understand how

	MARY and BILL get caught up in the sincerity. 

					TRIPLETTE
			You sing for people and that's what 
			he's about. He wants to help

	BILL bypasses all the talk about WALKER.

					TRIPLETTE
			You're doing some recording here,

	There is a long pause. STAR doesn't respond, so OPAL continues.

					OPAL
			She never came. I'm trying to 
			gather some information about the 
			characteristics of music people for 
			English television. I started in 
			San Francisco. Some friends were 
			making an anti-war film about 'Nam, 
			you know, and I just love marine 
			movies. It is really the consummate 
			art form, all those parts of the 
			puzzle to make the whole. All that 
			energy being collective, you know 
			what I mean?

	She removes same of her clothes because or the heat 

					OPAL
			I've been all over the United 
			States now except for Maine and 
			Vermont.

	STAR looks at her body and changes lanes.

					OPAL
			What did you say your name was?

					STAR
			Star.

					OPAL
			Star - oh! that's a fantastic name. 
			Almost as good as Opal. I changed 
			my name in Taos. This man that was 
			really into low budget movies said 
			my eyes were opalistic.

	She reaches over and turns on the RADIO. He reaches over and 
	turns it off.

					OPAL
			I'm going to make the consummate 
			documentary as soon as I finish 
			gathering information. You know 
			it's so nice not to feel oppressed 
			in a society that is male oriented.

					STAR
			Are you in music?

					OPAL
			No, I told you that.

134	EXT. HIGHWAY/STAR'S TRUCK The truck accelerates.

	radio and the steering wheel. There is a raw egg and a note that 
	says, "ha-ha."  KENNY is dumbfounded.

					KENNY
			What the hell?

	He opens the trunk. There are several political posters and 
	politically motivated materials for WALKER.

					JOAN
			What's this?

					KENNY
			Replacement party.

					JOAN
			Who's that?

					KENNY
			A guy named Walker. Amazing 
			person. He's developed a huge 
			following.

					JOAN
			How do you know?

					KENNY
			Well I've been following him around 
			Just listening to him --He says he 
			can really win -- I bet he can too -
			-

					JOAN
			You must really like him.

					KENNY
			Well, he's really amazing.

					JOAN
			I haven't gotten into politics yet. 
			I'm still into music --except for 
			you. You're into politics.

					NURSE
			Well, I don't know.

			It's on National television,

					BARNETT
			I don't care. She's always been

	There is a pause. BARNETT and REESE have been talking away from 
	BARBARA JEAN.

					REESE
			Well, how about the shopping

			You want me to wait?

					NURSE
			No. Mr. Green, I don't know how to

146B	ANOTHER ANGLE

	He wanders to the waiting area. GLENN has been looking out the

	begins to talk to GREEN so caught up in her he doesn't register 
	GREEN'S grief.

					GLENN
				 (loudly)
			My mamma used to know her... They 
			lived next door to each other... she 
			said she was always nursing the sick

	GREEN looks at him and nods. He's still got the vitamins in his 
	hand.

					GLENN
			I really learned all about her from

			to be famous.

	GREEN nods.

					GLENN
			The one thing she said to me when I 
			joined was "When you're doing your

			been doing. Now I'm going to hitch

	GREEN nods.

					GLENN
			You give my test to your wife1

	GREEN nods and puts the vitamins in his pocket as the NURSE calls

			Hi, I'm Sueleen Gay.

	TIRIPLETTE stares blatantly and REESE can hardly keep his hands 
	off her. SUELEEN starts into her routine as a matter of 
	survival.

			You like it?  Listen, where is the

	She hands over a stack of music.

			You all didn't say what you wanted

					TRIPLETTE
			Sueleen, you're prettier and

	They continue to walk past the many places. 

					TRIPLETTE
			Have you ever done this before?

	She shakes her head, "no" quite caught up in air.

					TRIPLETTE
			Well, it's not too hard. You'll 
			sing whatever it is you want to 
			sing. They'll applaud like crazy 
			'cause I can tell them that you're 
			really something and then the piano 
			and drum will give you a little 
			fanfare and you can sing and take 
			off your clothes or not sing. It 
			really doesn't make much difference, 
			really. But since you've never done 
			this before, singing might help.

	They are near three enormous beef legs waiting to go into the 
	oven. 

					TRIPLETTE
			Now this is to raise funds for 
			someone who can help people who are 
			less fortunate than yourself. The 
			more you take off, you see, more 
			money we can raise.

					SUELEEN
				 (like a robot)
			I see.

					TRIPLETTE
			I know that you are an artist and I 
			am sure you are very religious.

	She nods "yes."

			Oh.

	He releases SUELEEN, turns and runs up the street. She slides 
	down and hugs herself. The TRICYCLE MAN doesn't move.

					SUELEEN
			It'll be okay... It'll be okay... I

	END OF MONDAY.

	CUT TO:

177	EXT. HIGHWAY - AT KENNY'S CAFE - MORNING

	The TRICYCLE MAN is helping KENNY fix the car, changing tires, 
	etc. KENNY is under the hood. When he comes out, KENNY tells 
	the TRICYCLE MAN how grateful he is and that he wouldn't know 
	what to do if he hadn't shown up. The TRICYCLE MAN just finishes 
	the job.

	CUT TO:

178	EXT SHOPPING CENTER PARKING LOT - DAY

	A platform has been erected in the center of the parking lot. 
	BARBARA JEAN'S bus is parked nearby. There is a large crowd, and 
	several people gathered around the platform. GLENN is among them 
	so is TRIPLETTE, REESE and OPAL. Radio station personnel and 
	musicians prepare for the show. Finally, the bus door opens and 
	BARNETT leads BARBARA JEAN to the platform. The musicians start 
	and she sings. The sound comes from many huge speakers and 
	people come from stores and shops to hear.

	BARBARA JEAN segues from one song to another.

179	NEW ANGLE

	BARNETT stands to the side, talking to various people TRIPLETTE 
	pulls his sleeve.

					BARNETT
			Well, for heaven's sake. You're 
			just about everywhere, aren't you?

	THIPLETTE
	I came out to see how you all were doing.

					BARNETT
			I think I should tell you I know 
			why you're here. The answer is no 
			... we don't get involved in 
			politics.

					TRIPLETTE
				 (laughs good-
				 naturedly) 
			Well, that's not entirely true, 
			Barnett. At least not according to 
			Haven.

					BARNETT
			Haven? Hell,' we've been playing 
			poker together since we were 
			fourteen.

					TRIPLETTE
			I guess that's why he thought you 
			right want to help out.

					BARNETT
			He knows better.

					TRIPLETTE
			Well, it's probably because it 
			would help him.

					BARNETT
			How is that?

					TRIPLETTE
			Everybody likes to be as good as 
			their word.

					BARNETT
			Whose word?

					TRIPLETTE
			His Word.

					BARNETT
			His word? Are you telling me Haven 
			promised you something?

					TRIPLETTE
			That's pretty close. He's going to 
			be on the bill. Why not put Barbara 
			Jean on with him? 

	TRIPLETTE'S last sentence is caught in silence as BARBARA JEAN 
	has stopped singing in the middle of a phrase.

180	NEW ANGLE

	She holds the mike and looks at Barnett.

					BARBARA JEAN
			Barnett..

	She faints. There in a moment of confusion, then GLENN is on the 
	stage protectively as the musicians clear the people out

181	NEW ANGLE

	BARNETT vaults through the crowd pushing TRIPLETTE aside.

					BARNETT
			Get her feet up.

	He pulls himself on the stage. She is coming to and sees GLENN'S 
	face looking at her and rubbing her hands.

					BARNETT
			Okay, honey.

	He carries her to the bus. TRIPLETTE is forced to watch from a 
	distance.

182	INT. BUS - DAY

	BARBARA JEAN has come to and she and BARNETT are alone in the 
	back of the bus. He studies her carefully for a minute and then 
	decides she'll be all right.

					BARBARA JEAN
			Oh, Barnett, I'm so sorry.

					BARNETT
			Honey, it's okay... How do you feel 
			now?

					BARBARA JEAN
			All those people...

	She fights back the tears.

					BARNETT
			Don't worry, I'll take care or it

					BARBARA JEAN
			You're so good.

	He blows her a kiss and steps from the bus.

183	EXT. BUS - DAY

	BARNETT sends the nurses inside. GLENN has pushed to front of 
	the crowd. BARHETT grabs a hand mike.

					BARNETT
			She's fine now, folks. Just too 
			soon after the hospital, I guess.
				 (he pauses)
			She won't be able to continue and 
			she's in the bus crying her eyes 
			out, because she doesn't want to 
			disappoint the people who love her 
			the most.

	There is a group groan. BARNETT looks for some under-standing 
	but there is none. There are several catcalls and GLENN, who in 
	near BARNETT, becomes so enraged, he tries to find the caller. 
	There is almost a fight, but TRIPLETTE intervenes. He glances to 
	GLENN.

					TRIPLETTE
			Come on, come on. You don't want 
			to waste your energy on that fool.

184	NEW ANGLE

	Catcalls continue from other parts of the audience. TRIPLETTE 
	shouts against GLENN, who has turned his intensity to the crowd

					GLENN
			She's frail. You never saw anybody 
			so frail. I've seen her breathe hard 
			just standing still, dammit. You're 
			selfish. Worst selfish I've ever 
			heard. What if she died?  Would you 
			like that?  You'd probably say she 
			faked it so they could make money. 
			Well, you're just dumb.

185	NEW ANGLE

					TRIPLETTE
			We could invite them to the park.

					BARNETT
			What?

					TRIPLETTE
			They can come to the concert in the 
			park.

					BARNETT
			I said 'no!'

	BARNETT studies the angry crowd then TRIPLETTE, who is holding 
	back GLENN against them. The crowd is even more angry

					BARNETT
				 (to crowd)
			We're very Sorry... Please... If 
			you'll listen.
				 (he makes the 
				 decision)
			You can see her tomorrow at Percy 
			Warner Park...

	GLENN has disengaged from TRIPLETTE'S hold and pushed his way to 
	the back.

					BARNETT
			Triplette, I want to talk to you.

	Moves closer.

					BARNETT
			I got trapped and you know it, so 
			let's have some rules.

					TRIPLETTE
			Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I 
			understand your position.

					BARNETT
			No, you don't, so don't say you do. 
			Bunch of damn liars. What do you 
			get out or this?

					TRIPLETTE
			Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.

					BARNETT
			Your job, huh.

	He removes a pen and paper and writes down the following as he 
	speaks.

					BARNETT
			She will not appear on the stage or 
			support that Walker guy and you 
			can't have any of his signs up while 
			she sings. She'll be on first and 
			out of the park before he shows up. 
			There will be no pictures, no 
			questions, no answers or tying her 
			name up with his now or in the 
			future to come. Any money she makes 
			will go to the President of the 
			United States.

	He calls over his secretary and makes TRIPLETTE sign the 
	statement. Then the secretary signs.

					BARNETT
			We'll see you tomorrow. I'll send 
			her three songs over this afternoon. 
			She'll be done about ten minutes 
			after she starts and Walker better 
			not show up till she's through. Now, 
			get out of here.

	TRIPLETTE extends his hand expecting friendship. BARRETT ignores 
	it. As TRIPLETTE leaves, a MAN who has been after BARNETT'S 
	attention steps up. BARNETT turns to his secretary.

					MAN
			Barnett?

					BARNETT
				 (sharply)
			What?

					MAN
			Well, Barnett, I have this terrific 
			song I've been working on. It would 
			be a natural for Barbara Jean. Like 
			you to take a look at it.

	BARNETT looks at him suspiciously.

					BARNETT
			I'm very busy right now.
				 (to secretary) 
				 Get me Haven.

					MAN
			It'll just take a minute. Here, 
			I'll even hold it for you.

	BABNETT sighs and skims over the paper. Song stealing is the 
	same as horse stealing to BARNETT. He becomes enraged.

					BARNETT
			I don't know where you got this, 
			but something tells me you stole it 
			and I hate thieves.

	The MAN takes the paper back and tries to walk away from him -- 
	BARNETT yells after him.

					BARNETT
			Aren't you an engineer...?  I know 
			you -- Don't you work at one of 
			those cut a record places...? 
			Twenty-five bucks a shot, isn't it? 
			Usually their last twenty-five...

	The MAN backs up and BARNETT follows him. They have entered the 
	crowd. The MAB starts to run. BARNETT runs after him. When the 
	MAN gets into the car. BARNETT picks up a rock, throws it and 
	hits the windshield with it. The car MISFIRES but finally 
	starts.. As the MAN drives off, BARNETT stands watching until 
	he's out of sight.

	CUT TO:

	((THE FOLLOWING Is INTERCUT WITH THE SHOPPING CENTER)

186	EXT. FAIRGROUND - DAY

	We SEE a fairground, then a roller rink, and a wrestling ring, 
	and finally a small portable stage in the center of a circular 
	track. The grandstands are partially ruled and stock cars roar 
	from another part or the field;

	Around the stage -we SEE a sign that says, "Talent Show Tonight" 
	and we see the contestants and the MC, and NORMAN doing a routine 
	with an accordion player. After NORMAN finishes, the NC takes 
	the mike.

					MC
			Thank you, Mr. Berguan. And now we 
			bring you, 'Albuquerque.'

187	NEW ANGLE

	ALBUQUERQUE walks to the mike. 

					ALBUQUERQUE
			Hello, everybody. My name is 
			Albuquerque.

	There are-a few nasty remarks.

					ALBUQUERQUE
			I'm going to sing a wonderful tune.

	She starts to sing, "You're an Old Smoothie," and as she does the 
	stock cars leave the pit and drive to the entrance of the track. 
	ALEBUQUERQUE, disturbed at first, sings louder. The cars are 
	waiting for the talent show to set off the track.

188	NEW ANGLE

	Albuquerque starts to take off her clothes. The MC hasn't 
	noticed, but the grandstand has. People shout, "Take it off..."  
	ALBUQUERQUE loves it. Before ALBUQUERQUE can remove the last two 
	garments, the MC rushes over and grabs the mike.

					MC
			We'd 1ike~to announce the winner of 
			tonight's contest. Albuquerque, How 
			about some applause for a darling 
			little lady

					ALBUQUERQUE
			Oh, I'm not through.

					MC
			That's all, folks.

	The stands are calling to have her take it all off and her fellow 
	contestants are furious. RAVEN, BUD and PEARL are there and they 
	discuss her act.

					MC
			Here is the twenty dollars first 
			prize money and a seat in the 
			grandstands and now let's turn the 
			show over to Al Allen in the race 
			stand.

	He shuts oft the mike.

189	NEW ANGLE - TRACK

	The stock cars start around the track and stop in front or the 
	race announcer.

	AL
			Congratulations to Albuquerque and 
			welcome, everyone, to the Memorial 
			Race for Billy Apple, who died a 
			week ago in a wreck at this very 
			track, and we want you to know his 
			last words were, 'Are the other 
			fellows all right?'

	A wave of applause and we SEE the talent show make its way across 
	the rack. The platform is already torn down and the MC is 
	helping ALBUQUERQUE dress. As she passes the drivers, they cheer 
	and she blows them a kiss and loses her first garment as she 
	does. More cheers.

190	NEW ANGLE

	The cars are dented. On the side of one car it says, "Haven 
	Hamilton," and now we see him, BUD and PEARL in the stands. On 
	the side of another car it says, "Connie White."

	AL
	Want you all to save a dime every day and next Saturday we'll 
	take up a collection and give it all to Billy Apple's wife. 
	Share. Their four kids will sure miss their daddy. Want to 
	announce Bob Trilltree is out of the hospital now. Hope you'll 
	be back with us soon. All right, would you stand, please?

	The people stand to a scratchy record of the National Anthem. A 
	'74 Pontiac circles the track with a man holding a medium-sized 
	American flag which flaps as the convertible drive.. At the end 
	of the song the Pontiac drives off the track.

	AL
	This is for Billy Apple. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, let's pick 
	ourselves a winner.

191	NEW ANGLE

	The drivers get into their cars and start up. The track man 
	waves a flag which starts them around the track in pairs. We 
	notice the TRICYCLE MAN, who has been there all the time. The 
	race starts and the SOUND is deafening. ALBUQUERQUE is thrilled 
	to death. Suddenly, STAR sneaks up on her as she whistles with 
	her fingers in her mouth.

					STAR
			Winifred.

					ALBUQUERQUE
			Hi! Star.

					STAR
			Winifred, the kids want you home 
			and so do I.

					ALBUQUERQUE
			I won first prize.

					STAR
			Come on.

	She has no choice but to follow him out. Several people 
	compliment her as she leaves the grandstand. She buys a bag of 
	peanuts on the way out.

192	INT. TOM'S MOTEL ROOM

	CUT TO:

	There is some lovemaking going on in Tom's bed.

					TOM
			You're really terrific, you know 
			what I mean --LINNEA rolls over and 
			faces him.

					LINNEA
			I have to go.

					TOM
			Wrong.

					LINNEA
			I have to go. He sighs.

					TOM
			I know.

	She makes a more to leave.

					TOM
			Stay.

					LINNEA
			I can't.

					TOM
			Car pool?

	She laughs and eases out of the bed.

					TOM
			When did you think it would happen?

					LINNEA
			I'm not sure.

					TOM
			I knew when I first met you.

					LINNEA
			Oh.

	She starts to go into the bathroom.

					TOM
			How old are you?

					LINNEA
			Older.

					TOM
			Thirty?

					LINNEA
			Well...

					TOM
			I'm twenty-eight

					LINNEA
			Oh.

					TOM
			Older than thirty?

	She nods.

					TOM
			Terrific!  Who was that black guy? 
			A friend of yours?

					LINNEA
			That's unkind.

					TOM
			Come on, you ever been attracted to 
			a black guy?

	She looks at him close, then goes into the bathroom and shuts the 
	door.

193	INT. MOTEL BATHROOM - AFTERNOON

	We HEAR TOM making a phone call. LINNEA grabs a towel and wraps 
	it around her head and throws back the shower curtain, only to 
	find a huge black cockroach in the tub. TOM laughs as she shuts 
	the curtain in horror, then she proceeds to take a sponge bath. 
	She leaves the bathroom quickly.

194	INT. MOTEL ROOM - AFTERNOON

	TOM is still on the phone. LINNEA dresses, but can't find her 
	slip. She finishes and heads for the door.

					TOM
				 (into phone)
			Just a minute.

	He steps to LINNEA and puts his arms around her. 

					TOM
			I'll talk to you tomorrow.

					LINNEA
			That's what you said before.

					TOM
			I know. Goodbye.

	He kisses her and walks back to the bed. As she gets to the 
	door, she is hit with something,  It is her slip.

					TOM
			Maybe you better keep that.

	He smiles and she walks out the door.

			Okay... you get to sleep. I'll see

	again, waits near him. BARNETT is talking to REESE.

200	ANOTHER ANGLE

	TRIPLETTE is at the stairs. GLENN is trying to get past a guard 
	and finally TRIPLETTE recognizing him from the shopping center, 
	helps him in. They enter the stair area, near all the TV cables 
	and equipment.

201	NEW ANGLE

	They approach BARBARA JEAN, who is talking to musicians. BILL and 
	MARY are there with NORMAN, and LINNEA is singing on stage with 
	the black choir. TOMMY now steps up to talk to BARBARA JEAN.

202	NEW ANGLE

	GLENN is lost in BARBARA JEAN'S magic. She smiles at him, but in 
	talking to HAVEN, BUD and PEARL and looking for BARNETT. 
	TRIPLETTE walks by GLENN.

					GLENN
			Listen, could you give her this for 
			me?

	TRIPLETTE takes a note from GLENN.

					TRIPLETTE
			Sure thing. 

					GLENN
			Thanks.

					TRIPLETTE

	TRIPLETTE hands her the note as BARRETT angrily steps up. 
	Someone calls  "places."

					BARNETT
			They screwed up. You go on after 
			the choir.

	TOMMY BROWN joins LINNEA and the choir on stage. We SEE TOM 
	wandering and avoiding BILL, but catching MARY'S eye. OPAL is 
	near as is LA JOAN. BARBARA JEAN reads GLENN'S note: "If I die 
	tomorrow, I lived today."

203	NEW ANGLE

	The applause builds.

					ANNOUNCER
			Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Barbara 
			Jean...

	The audience is swept away.

	In the audience we see KENNY and the TRICYCLE MAN and WADE. 
	SUELEEN is there, too.

205	ANOTHER ANGLE -- STAGE AREA

	As BARBARA JEAN sings, GLENN stands next to BARNETT. She finishes 
	the song and looks in GLENN'S direction.

206	ANGLE - BARBARA JEAN

	She is leaning on a stool.

					BARBARA JEAN
			I want to thank you for all your 
			good wishes. You are so important 
			to Barnett and me. Now I want to 
			sing a special song for all our 
			soldier boys.

	The orchestra starts. She calls for HAVEN to come out. The 
	applause swells and, they start a song together.

207	EXT. FRONT OF PARK - DAY

	A long black limo is parked near two ambulances, the attendants 
	sitting on the ambulance fenders and joking.

208	ANGLE - STAGE

	BARBARA JEAN and HAVEN have finished the soldier song. The choir 
	comes out to back her now. The audience picks up the song they 
	sing. After the song everyone claps loudly, and a large bouquet 
	of flowers gets handed up to BARBARA JEAN. They hug as someone 
	begins to unfurl a "HAL PHILIP WALKER" banner behind them. 
	Photographers crowd in. Suddenly there is a sharp jolt in 
	HAVEN'S body and BARBARA JEAN is down. There is brief confusion, 
	but the choir continues to sing and everyone thinks BARBARA JEAN 
	has fainted again.

209	NEW ANGLE

	The confusion mounts as both HAVEN and BARBARA JEAN are down and 
	there are flowers lying all over the place

					HAVEN
			Barnett!  My God, Barnett  I'm 
			shot!

	TRIPLETTE runs up the stairs and the choir continues. BARNETT 
	yells for them to stop. He and BARNETT are over BARRARA JEAN, 
	while guards and BUD attend to HAVEN.

					TRIPLETTE
			She's... oh, my God... there's 
			blood here...
				 (taking mike)
			Ladies and gentlemen, I don't know 
			what to say.

210	ANGLE - AUDIENCE

	There is a VOICE among the noise that shouts:

	I could have got that Walker bastard before. I've been closer, 
	closer than this, but my Nash broke down and somebody kept 
	stealing my things. I wanted to get him the day before, then Mr. 
	Green's wire died, so this was the right time. I love the 
	President of the United States. I love him.

	Guards grab the speaker, KENNY, in an instant. He shoots a 
	policeman's foot by accident. Men swallow him up. Someone 
	yells, "sing."

211	ANGLE - STAGE

	The choir has no direction to go in. ALRUQUERQUE suddenly is 
	with microphone.. She starts to do "It Don't Worry Me."  The rest 
	of the singers join in.

212	EXT. PERCY WALKER PARK - DAY

	BARNETT leads the stretcher to one or the ambulances. He doesn't 
	allow HAVEN to enter.

					BARNETT
			Have your friend Triplette take you 
			to the hospital.

	A man walks up from the limo. It is WALKER. TRIPLETTE is near.

					 WALKER
	What'd she do, faint again?  I'm getting tired of waiting in the

	TRIPLETTE turns and belts him.
