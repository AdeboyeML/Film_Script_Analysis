          FADE IN

          EXT. FITZGERALD HOME -- NIGHT

          The house is dark. The moon is almost full. A dog barks.
          A melancholy voice, worn for its age, narrates:
          BRIGITTE (V/o)
          Ever try bein' different? An, I
          don't mean jus' thinkin' about
          it, either. Ginger an' me - I
          mean I...
          The house numbers read 669. The 9 slips: the number now
          reads 666.

          BRIGITTE (CON'T/V/O)
          Ginger an' I? Went for different.
          Big time.
          There's a light on in a basement window. We creep up to it,
          crushing the tulip. borders on the way. The window is propped
          open with a sneaker: it looks like somebody's foot is caught
          in it. Music plays inside-

          INT. GIRLS' BASEMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Gyrating in her underwear to bad-girl grunge, BRIGITTE
          FITZGERALD (15) straddles GINGER FITZGERALD (also 15 and in
          underwear) on one of the twin single beds. Both girls have
          cigarettes lolling on their lower lips. Both girls have
          pierced eyebrows, pierced noses and streaked hair. Brigitte
          has blue nail polish on. Ginger has breasts.

          GINGER
          Brigitte. Quit dickin' around.
          Jus' do it.
          Brigitte reluctantly stops her thrashing and douses a cotton
          ball in rubbing alcohol.
          Without looking up from her TANK GIRL comic, Ginger hauls her
          own shirt up to expose her navel.
          Brigitte swabs Ginger's navel with the wet cotton ball. Her
          eyes drift to Ginger's chest, then back to what she's doing.

          

          

          

          

           2

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          Ginger's ten months older than
          me. we're seriously tight. Share
          everything. Everything.
          Around them, many candles burn. There's a dead bolt on the
          door. An attached full bath. The floors are thick with
          paranormal books. The walls are covered in images of UFO's
          and horror flicks. A framed photo of Kurt Cobain with
          Courtney Love has a place of honor. There's an old Polaroid
          of the girls at five in Halloween costumes; Lill Red Riding
          Hood and the Big Bad Wolf. Ginger is the wolf.
          Brigitte produces an enormous darning needle. It glints. she
          levels it at Ginger's navel, her hand shaking.

          BR IG ITTE
          Ready?

          GINGER
          (without looking up)
          Uh-huh.

          BRIGITTE
          .I can't.
          Ginger gives Brigitte a look over the top of her comic.
          Brigitte takes a deep breath, and lines the needle up again.
          Brigitte swallows hard and applies pressure. The needle
          pierces Ginger's skin. Her stomach muscles flinch.

          GINGER

          OUCH!

          BRIGITTE
          You said it wouldn't hurt!

          GINGER
          Jus' hurry up!
          The needle has stopped moving half-way through the skin.

          BRIGITTE
          Uh-oh .
          Brigitte wiggles the needle. Blood wells up around it.

          BRIGITTE
          Um. I think it's stuck. Oh man.
          There's blood...
          Ginger lowers her comic. she takes one look at the needle
          half-.in, half-out of her belly button - and cracks up.

          

          

          

          

           3

          BRIGITTE
          snot funny, Ginger!
          Laughing her head off, Ginger gives the needle a good tug
          from her end. The skin tugs with it, resisting.

          BRIGITTE
          Ali, gawd, gross.
          Ginger yanks the needle, hard. This time it moves.

          GINGER
          I got it, I got it.
          Ginger grits her teeth. The needle begins a slow progress.

          GINGER
          It's goin', it's goin'- gimme
          the ring
          Brigitte grabs at a tiny silver ring on the bed spread but
          knocks it to the floor. Brigitte scrambles after it. Ginger
          yanks the needle.

          GINGER
          Bee?! C'mon!
          Brigitte finds the ring and hands it to Ginger. Ginger sets
          the ring on the end of the needle, looping it not-so-neatly
          through.

          BRIGITTE
          Oh, groo-oo-o-ss!
          The bloody needle pops clear. Ginger grinds on the ring to
          close it. Ginger wipes her bloody hands on the bed. Brigitte
          is taking deep, gulping breaths.

          GINGER
          Bee? Feeb. Y'okay?

          BRIGITTE
          Yeah. I think so.

          GINGER

          (TEASING)
          Yeah, I think not.

          BRIGITTE
          If you din't say it hurt, I'd a
          been fine!
          Ginger beams at her new piercing.

          

          

          

          

           4

          GINGER
          Pretty cool, unh?
          The flesh around the navel is hot pink and bruising. Brigitte
          grins too.

          BRIGITTE
          very cool.

          GINGER
          Now I'll do you.
          Brigitte bravely hangs onto to her smile.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          We do everything together. But,
          at fifteen? A chick can change.
          Ya know?
          [3A! You got no idea.

          EXT. THE FTTZGERALD BACKYARD - DAY

          It's a beautiful autumn day in suburbia. Birds sing. The
          terrier next door (NORMAN) barks and barks.
          A pierced navel is stretched taught, filling with blood.
          Ginger's limp body is bent backward over a low fence. Blood
          is flowing from where she's been speared through her chest:
          Ginger's impaled on a white picket.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          Don't get me wrong. It's not
          like we were all happy or
          nothin' to begin with.
          Brigitte takes a long, ponderous drag on her cigarette as -
          unmoved - she takes in Ginger's mortal wound. Brigitte eyes
          the identical homes and gardens that stretch on to the
          horizon.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          The suburb of Bailey Downs?
          Basically a well lit black hole.
          The Kingdom of cul du sac.
          That's French for Dead End.
          Brigitte flicks her smoke into a pile of neatly raked leaves.
          It smolders then goes out. She scowls.

          

          

          

          

           5

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          You had a gram of personality
          out here? Life bit the big one.
          A truck with COUNTY REGREENING PROGRAM on its side pulls up a
          few houses over. Brigitte watches a shirtless sun-bronzed
          Adonis - SAM -- climb out of the cab.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          Of course I'm generalizing.
          A tarty teenage girl - TRINA - bounds up to Sam and gives him
          a big wet one.

          BRIGITTE (V/0)
          No I'm not.

          GINGER
          The fuck, Bee. Take a picture
          already.
          Brigitte raises a 35mm still camera to her eye and frames her
          sister's corpse in the viewfinder.

          ROLL HEAD CREDIT SEQUENCE:
          snap! A slide of Ginger - dead on a white picket fence -
          smashes on. The HEAD CREDITS are superimposed on each of the
          slide images:
          snap! Ginger sliced up with an electric knife in the kitchen,
          Snap! Ginger drowned in a bubble bath,
          Snap! Ginger hanged by nylons in the laundry room,
          Snap! Ginger mangled under the front tires of a mini van.

          PICTURE TITLE: GINGER SNAPS.

          INT. BAILEY HIGH ART ROOM - DAY

          The Fitzgerald sisters stand over a slide projector in art
          class, just finishing the slide show from the credit
          sequence. An empty frame of blinding white light snaps onto
          the collapsible screen at the front of the room.
          The homely ART TEACHER looks very concerned as she hits the
          lights. The other STUDENTS â¢-- all about fifteen, middle-class
          and raging conformists -- sit in stunned silence. As Brigitte
          and Ginger return to their side-by-side seats,

          

          

          

          

           6

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          We were always considered
          freaks. For as long as I can
          remember, there was Us. And
          there was Them. Like from
          kindergarten.

          ART TEACHER
          Very -um. Class? Comments?
          The students trade constipated looks.

          ART TEACHER
          Brigitte. What does it mean for
          you?
          Brigitte shrugs and squirms.

          GINGER
          Means there's more to life than
          -- well, li.fe.
          The Fitzgeralds look expectantly at row after row of blank
          faces. Brigitte shakes her head.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          Attempts at communication wore
          futile.
          JASON McCARDY- a good-looking high school Casanova - looks
          Ginger over appraisingly. Ginger ignores him.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          Some of Them did seem to wanna
          reach Ginger?
          Brigitte glances from Ginger's breasts to her own flat chest.
          Brigitte takes a deep breath.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          But nobody wanned to reach me.
          The bell goes.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          (a tad defensive)
          Like I cared.

          INT. BAILEY HIGH HALLS - DAY

          TEENS clog the halls. Judging by the herd, Bailey High is not
          big on individual identity, or at least its outward
          expression.
          Ginger and Brigitte slip down the crowded corridors, sticking
          out like sore thumbs. Ginger holds her forehead.

          GINGER
          Gawd, People! They hurt my
          brain!

          BRIGITTE
          They didn't even get it.

          GINGER
          They're retards.

          BRIGITTE
          They're cretins.

          GINGER
          They're bone-heads.

          BRIGITTE
          't'hey' re somnambulists.

          GINGER
          They're leems.

          BRIGITTE
          They're the goddamn walkin'-/
          The girls stop before their locker. A folded up piece of
          loose leaf has been crushed into it, its end sticking out.

          BR I G ITTE

          (UNIMPRESSED)
          Another one?
          Ginger opens the locker. She unfolds the paper. There's a big
          fat joint inside, and a note that says: GINGER, CALL 555-

          4636.
          Ginger pockets the joint, crumples the paper into a ball and
          tosses it at a near-by trash can. She misses.
          The girls head down the hall..

          BRIGITTE
          Somebody leaves you all. these
          jays an, yer not even curious to
          call?

          

          

          

          

           8
          Ginger offers her a sucker and has one herself.

          GINGER
          No pe .
          A FAT JANITOR scoops up the wad of loose leaf with great
          resentment and jams it into the trash.
          Brigitte and Ginger pass a NECKING COUPLE practically dry-
          humping, GIRLS applying make-up to one another, and BOYS
          snapping each other with their sports cups.
          Jason and his fellow jock-pals TIM, FRANK, and JEREMY are
          scoping babes.
          Ginger bends to tie her boot lace and a collective groan
          swells from the guys.

          JASON
          See? She's weird, but hot.

          TIM
          Anybody poled Fitzy yet?
          Brigitte gives them a disgusted look.

          TIM
          Not that one. The cute one.
          Brigitte's face falls. Ginger gives them a Death Stare. The
          boys try flirty smiles.

          GINGER
          (to Brigitte)
          Sad. Must be hard to think with
          yer brains slappin' around yer
          thighs like that all day.
          Brigitte laughs. Ginger pulls her on, past a sign: GYMNASIUM.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          We didn't do guys. Guys were too
          gross. Everyone at Bailey High
          was just too incredibly gross.
          Ginger applies her boot to a swinging door and they enter,

          INT. GIRLS' CHANGING ROOM - DAY

          The Fitzgeralds stop dead. They take in a menagerie of 90210-
          wanna-be GIRLS changing for gym class. The background chat is
          all sex and mascara.
          There is only one free spot: next to Trina and her TRINA
          CLONES. The Trinas slide into a-size-too-small shorts while
          parading hefty chests. The Trina acts like she owns the
          goddamn planet.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          The only thing worse than most
          teenage boys are most teenage
          girls. Trinas are the limit.
          Ginger digs at her lower abdomen painfully.

          GINGER
          I feel sick.

          BRIGITTE
          Me too.

          GINGER
          No, J. mean really.
          Gingler opens a locker and tears off her clothes. Other girls
          glance at her navel piercing with disgust..
          Brigitte is very self-conscious: she steps almost inside the
          locker, hiding behind the door while she changes into the
          revolting school gym outfit. She eyes the buxom bubble heads
          with contempt, as

          BRI.GITTE (V/O)
          There was really only one Trina,
          but they were all the same.
          Trina finds the Fitzgeralds' open locker door a nuisance.
          She pushes it out of her way, hard enough to whack Brigitte
          in the head on the other side.

          TRINA

          (FAKELY)
          Ooops. Sorry.
          Ginger gives Trina a very dirty look. Brigitte tries to rub
          her sore head while clutching her uniform to cover her chest.
          Trina and her posse cackle as they prance out, their butt
          cheeks waggling. The sisters continue changing.

          

          

          

          

           1 0

          GINGER
          (to Brigitte)
          Y' okay's

          BRIGITTE
          I HATE her. Like to feed her
          ground glass with tacks for
          desert. Then make her puke it
          back up and swallow it again
          until she's like shredded to a
          bazillion pieces from the inside
          out...
          Ginger grips her sides painfully and bends double.

          BRIGITTE,
          what's the matter?

          GINGER
          I got gas...Maybe I'll try an,
          cut one right in her face out
          there.
          They slap hands, laughing. They look down at their gym
          outfits, which are SO unflattering. Brigitte and Ginger
          exchange identical looks of agony.

          EXT. BAILEY HIGH SPORTS FIELD - DAY

          The twenty or so participants in this all-girl gym class
          stand ready at centre field in lacrosse padding and helmets.
          Brigitte and Ginger stand apart from the others, sharing a
          smoke. Brigitte looks scared. Ginger looks ill.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          After two weeks a' high school.,
          ya come to the conclusion it's
          all about agony. Take Phys. Ed,
          sus' practise takin' pain.
          The gym teacher. M7.,. SYKES - an aging former-traffic cop -
          hucks the players sticks with nets on one end. Sykes is given
          to screaming.

          SYKES
          Field lacrosse is no pussy-assed
          tea party, ya get IN there, get
          a LOCK on your target and PUSH
          IT! I want SWEAT I want ACTION!
          The Trinas giggle at Sykes. Ginger bends forward, holding her
          sides.

          

          

          

          

           1 1

          MZ.SYKES
          Shake a leg, Fitzgeralds. An,
          butt out, you gotta death wish!?

          GINGER
          Feel really sick, Mz. Sykes.

          MZ. SYRES
          Cigarettes'll do that for you!
          Move!
          Ginger flicks the smoke at Sykes' turned back. It falls
          short, of course.
          The sisters trudge to their places on the field. Ginger is on
          the offensive line. Brigitte is in goal.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          Phys. Ed. is not optional at
          Bailey High.
          Sykes blows the whistle. A fast-moving, hard-hitting
          lacrosse scrimmage begins.
          IN RAPID-FIRE MONTAGE: Ginger gets caught in the crunch of
          sticks and bodies, pushed, kicked, and punished by the
          Trinas, who are having 'fun'.
          IN RAPID-FIRE MONTAGE: Brigitte visibly cowers as a tangle of
          marauding, ball-whacking bodies descend on her. She takes a
          number of direct hits from the hard rubber ball.
          on a powerful press for a goal, Trina slams into Brigitte so
          hard Brigitte flies right out of the net area. And skids
          face-first .into a mangled dog's body.
          The whistle blows and play stops. Ginger lopes over,
          breathless, gripping her sore stomach.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          I been waiting for this. There'd
          been a lot of dead dogs around
          lately, but this was my personal
          first.
          Brigitte slowly climbs out of the mucky canine remains to her
          knees. She's covered in doggie guts and maggots.

          TRINA
          Oh, HOW GRO-O-O-O-OSS!!

          The class edges toward them, but maintains a horrified
          distance. Even Sykes struggles with a gag reflex on seeing
          Brigitte' s mess.
          Brigitte fingers the dog's remains with a look of
          fascination.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          'Kay, here's the weird thing
          about me. I dig dead stuff. Live
          things make me sick, they're all
          warm and snotty and shitty and
          pissy. And live things jus'
          suffer, which I can't take. But
          a dead thing? S'kinda beautiful,
          'cause a dead thing's really I
          dunno -like, free.

          SYKES
          Don't TOUCH it, Fitzgerald!
          What's WRONG with you two?!
          Get up and hit the SHOWERS!

          TRINAS IN CHORUS
          The cult? Drains the blood out
          and drinks it, ya know! /1 heard
          they have sex with them first !
          /Gawd stop, you'll make me PUKE!

          BRIGITTE (V/0)
          Everyone was all like, Oh it's a
          teen cult, or aah, it's some
          looney, the Beast a' Bailey
          Downs. What crap.

          SYKES
          All RIGHT, ladies, settle! This
          is no joke! You have information
          about the dog deaths you do

          WHAT!

          CLASS IN CHORUS
          (by rote)
          Tell a teacher, Principal
          Fardor, or the police.

          BRIGITTE
          Teen cult my ass. Look Ginge',
          something went for its throat -
          it's not cut, it's chewed...
          Brigitte looks up in time to see Ginger's eyes roll back in
          her head. Ginger faints. The class inhales as one.

          

          

          

          

           1 3

          BRIGITTE
          Ginger?
          Sykes and the class stampede up. Sykes pushes Brigitte out
          of the way.

          BRIGITTE (V/0)
          Ginger's no pussy. She doesn't
          faint. I might faint. Like, if
          this pooch were only HALF-dead,
          I could faint.
          Brigitte stumbles over the dog carcass. She hugs herself.

          INT. NURSE' S OFFICE -- DAY

          Brigitte sits in her bloodied uniform, chewing her nails.
          NURSE FERRY - a Mrs. Doubtfi.re-type who chirps more than
          speaks - is examining Ginger.

          FERRY
          The fainting' s worrisome
          you don't diet do you dear?

          GINGER
          No.

          FERRY
          Hm. Anemia's very common at your
          age. Eat more red meat, try an
          iron vitamin supplement. If it
          happens again, straight to a
          proper doctor, all righty?
          Brigitte looks relieved.

          FERRY
          Now as for 'the headache, cramps,
          lower back pain .I'm guessing
          your period is due.

          GINGER
          I haven't got a, um, period.

          FERRY
          Never? Flow old are you?

          GINGER
          Fifteen. our mother says we're
          late bloomers.

          

          

          

          

           1 4

          FERRY
          Well judging by your troubles,
          I'd say you can expect to
          blossom any time now!
          Brigitte pulls a face. Ferry produces numerous samples of
          feminine hygiene products and heaps them onto Ginger.

          FERRY
          Are you familiar with all these?
          Ginger shrugs.

          FERRY
          Now what suits one girl might
          not be comfortable for another.
          The proper form of protection is
          a personal choice, and may have
          a lot to do with your menstrual
          flow, which naturally changes
          during the time you'll have your
          little miracle of nature. It
          could start thick and syrupy,
          move to a straight-forward basic
          bright red bleeding and then
          perhaps a deep brownish to
          blackish slime, signaling the
          end of the flow. Twenty-eight
          days later or there abouts,
          it'll start all over again and
          continue every month until
          menopause, in about thirty
          years' time.
          Nurse Ferry produces a pocket calendar with a tampon or pad
          advertisement for every month.

          FERRY (CON'T)
          Here's a little calendar to keep
          track, count from the day it
          starts twenty-eight days.
          That'll be your next time. You
          have any questions, come see me
          again.
          (to Brigitte)
          You too sweetheart, be your turn
          shortly, I expect.
          Brigitte Looks horrified.

          EXT. A SUBURBAN STREET/TRAVELING - DAY


          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          Here's a dirty word.
          Inevitability. That fate fully
          intended us to be typical in any
          way, sooner or later, was so
          insulting.
          Ginger and Brigitte trudge homeward looking completely
          depressed. Brigitte flips through the feminine hygiene
          calendar. Ginger watches the pavement beneath her feet.

          BRIGITTE
          (reading a panty-
          liner ad)
          "Some days it's all you need."-?
          What does that mean?

          GINGER
          So you pulled a Quincy on that
          dog, unh?

          BRIGITTE
          Hunh?
          Ginger grabs the calendar and sticks it in her pocket.

          GINGER
          Quincy, that guy with the stiffs
          on cable. Alls I remember is you
          goin', "Teen cult my ass".

          BRIGITTE
          Oh. Right. Well, I dunno.
          Brigitte shrugs. She gives Ginger a funny look.

          GINGER
          Why are you looking at me like
          that? Do I look - different?

          BRIGITTE
          No.

          GINGER
          Can you tell I'm going to-?

          BRIGITTE
          No. .Really.
          Ginger squints at her, unconvinced.

          

          

          

          
          GINGER SNAPS- WALTON/July 22, 1996 1 6

          GINGER
          Wham. Total adultness. How can I
          have a miracle of nature an, not
          be old enough to drive! fiurih?
          The fuck.
          Ginger kicks a kiddie toy hard into a yard. Brigitte doesn't
          have an answer to this.

          EXT. FITZGERALD BUNGALOW - DAY

          Their house looks like a set in a home show. The girls take
          it in from the front drive with expressions of complete
          weariness. Next door, Norman the terrier barks at them.

          GINGER
          Hey. If I start simpin' around
          tampon dispensers and moanin'
          over cramps, or even think about
          buying somethin' that says Baby
          Powder Fresh? You'll. shoot me,
          right?
          BR TG.'i"I'L
          of course.
          They exchange grins.

          GINGER
          Out by sixteen

          BRIGITTE
          .or dead in this scene.
          Ginger raises her hand and Brigitte smacks it hard. As they
          mount the drive, Ginger picks up a stone and hucks it at
          Norman, who's still barking. She misses.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          If we failed to get a life by
          Ginger's sixteenth birthday? we
          were s'posed to gas ourselves in
          the garage. For smart girls, we
          could be pretty dumb. we prob'ly
          never woulda done it, but we
          seemed to need a deadline.

          INT. FITZGERALD DINING ROOM - NIGHT

          The Fitzgerald family are having their evening meal. Their
          parents, HENRY (see Men's Section, Seers catalogue) and

          

          

          

          

           1 7
          PAMELA (see Martha Stewart's Idea of Living), are liberal,
          middle class folks in their early forties. Ginger looks
          bored. Brigitte eats like a pig.

          HENRY
          How was school today?

          GINGER
          Fine.

          BRIGITTE (V/U)
          The nicest thing I could say
          about Henry and Pamela was also
          the meanest thing I could say.

          PAMELA
          Didn't you have a presentation?
          How'd it go?

          GINGER
          Fine.
          Pamela and Henry exchange irritatingly patient smiles.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          They were easily satisfied.
          A rogue's gallery on the wall depicts Henry and Pamela's
          transformation over the years from angry young Ban The Bomb-
          types into middle-class mundane.

          PAMELA
          Made an appointment for you
          girls at my gynecologist. Next
          Thursday.
          Henry studies his plate. Ginger almost imperceptibly shakes
          her head at Brigitte. Brigitte nods, understanding.

          GINGER
          why.

          PAMELA
          You know why.

          GINGER
          we're not going to a
          gynecologist.

          PAMELA
          What did I say about that tone
          of voice? .You are going to
          the gynecologist.

          

          

          

          

           1 8

          GINGER
          Dad!? She's completely paranoid!

          HENRY
          I'd rather stay out of this.

          GINGER
          She's gonna have some fat jerk
          get his jollies poking his
          fingers up our ./

          HENRY

          (INTERRUPTING)
          I'm actually eating here.

          PAMELA
          Henry, neither one of them has
          had a period yet.

          HENRY
          Ah. Yes. You've said.
          Repeatedly.
          As Pamela says the next line, Ginger mou t:hs it- word for word
          1.a Brigitte.

          PAMELA
          It's very odd that two perfectly
          healthy fifteen year olds are
          not menstruating. Right?
          Briggitte apes Henry's next line back to Ginger.

          HENRY
          Mmmm. steak's really yummy
          tonight. This a new sauce?
          The sisters giggle. Pamela is losing her cool.

          PAMELA
          I started at eleven. The problem
          must be on your side, Henry.

          HENRY
          Pamela? This is not my fault. No
          one's at fault here.

          PAMELA
          when did your sister start?

          

          

          

          

           1 9

          HENRY
          I've told you, I really have no
          idea. Oddly enough, we never
          discussed it. why don't you call
          her and ask her yourself?

          PAMELA
          I can't call her out of the blue
          and ask a thing like that.
          Besides, it's dinner time.
          They'll be eating.

          HENRY
          A--ha!

          PAMELA
          Well I've been checking panties
          for four years now

          GINGER & BRIGITTE/HENRY
          Mo-othe-er!!! /For chrissakes.

          GINGER (CON'T)
          You look at our underwear? Fuck!

          HENRY
          Hey, hey - I don't want to hear
          that word in my house. You will
          do as your mother says and I
          will change the subject. Anybody
          going to tell me what happened
          to my fence?
          From under the table, Henry produces the bloodied, sawed-off
          picket stained bloody from Ginger's impaling.
          Brigitte holds her full mouth open so Ginger can see its
          masticated contents. Ginger cracks up laughing. Henry and
          Pamela sigh.

          INT. GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Norman the terrier barks OFF-SCREEN - constantl
          Brigitte grimaces at the cartoon-style diagrams of How To
          Insert A Tampon. She carefully unwraps one and sets it in a
          glass of water. She times its expansion on her watch.

          BRIGITTE
          Why din't you jus' tell her
          you're going to get it?

          

          

          

          

           20
          Ginger is dissecting the gift joint from their locker. she
          sniffs its contents.

          GINGER
          Can't take her 'attention'. She
          grosses me out. Can't believe
          she's our mother.
          Brigitte puts a fresh tampon up her nose and lifts a Polaroid
          camera at arms' length from her face.

          BRIGITTE
          Yeah, but now we have to see
          this doctor. You can jus' say
          you got it, but I'm screwed.
          FLASH! The Polaroid spits out the front. Brigitte sticks
          another tampon in her free nostril, and one in each ear as,

          GINGER
          Did I get you out of Home Ec?
          Did I get you out of ballet
          classes? So I'll get you out of
          this, right?

          BR IG ITTE
          You better, gawd the idea
          FLASH! Brigitte takes a Polaroid of herself with a tampon
          sticking out of every visible orifice.
          Ginger slides the grass into a pre-rolled fresh casing and
          sticks it in her mouth.

          GINGER
          I said I will, I will. This
          jay's fine. Let us smoke,
          sister.
          Ginger cranks the stereo and throws on a coat. She double-
          takes Brigitte' s tampon face.

          GINGER
          WHAT are you doing?

          BRIGITTE
          (sticking tampons
          under her upper lip)
          Look - a walrus.

          GINGER
          Hardee-har. Har.

          

          

          

          

           21
          Ginger steps up on the bed and swings the ground-level window
          open.

          EXT A NEIGHBOR'S YARD - NIGHT
          Norman the terrier's incessant barking goes on in the
          distance. The moon is full tonight.
          A plastic child's playhouse sits in their next door
          neighbors' back yard. A cloud of blue smoke emanates from its
          doors and windows. There is an occasional FLASH! from within,
          and the whir of the Polaroid's motor.

          INT. PLAYHOUSE - NIGHT

          In the moonlight, the joint's cherry burns hell-fire red. A
          couple of Polaroid buddy-shots sit at their feet. Brigitte
          tokes and passes the jay to Ginger..

          BRIGITTE
          How'l1 you know when you finally
          get it any ways?

          GINGER
          Prob'ly feel like peein' your
          pants.

          BRIGITTE
          Disgusting.

          GINGER
          Well I'm not too excited.

          BRIGITTE,
          (checking her watch)
          We're missing Unsolved
          Mysteries.

          GINGER
          Wish I was an unsolved mystery.
          Brigitte reflects on this heavy thought, nodding - stoned.

          GINGER
          Hey. You smell somethin' gross?

          

          

          

          
          GINGER SNAPS - WALTON/July 15, 1996 22

          EXT. NEIGHBOR'S YARD - NIGHT

          The girls sniff around the playhouse. Ginger steps on
          something that makes an evil squeeshy sound. She skids and
          ends up on her ass.

          GINGER
          This is so not my day.
          Brigitte helps her to her feet. Ginger shakes what she
          slipped on off her shoe. It's a long, ropy intestine. She
          drags her shoe to get the blood and goo of it.

          GINGER
          Nice. Dog shit.

          BRIGITTE
          (thrilled to
          recognize the smell)
          That isn't shit... it's death.
          A line of blood and gore trails across the grass to a back
          lane. Brigitte follows it. Ginger looks around for something
          on the ground.

          GINGER
          Great. Lost the jay. Great.

          EXT. SERVICE LANE - NIGHT

          Ginger joins Brigitte, who's squatted before another dog's
          body. This one's a fresh kill.

          BRIGITTE
          Ack, it's still warm, gross.
          Brigitte takes its picture FLASH! with the Polaroid, which is
          strung around her neck.

          GINGER
          Why every dog but the mutt next
          door to us?

          BRIGITTE
          Hey, we could take it home. Try
          like, an autopsy. Like, crack
          the case!

          GINGER
          Nah. Let's put ' im in there so
          he won't. Lraumatize the kiddies.

          

          

          

          

           23
          Ginger indicates a construction dumpster on the end of the
          lane. Disappointed, Bee rolls down her sleeves to cover her
          hands. Ginger does the same and they shovel the body onto
          their arms.
          They trot the dog over to the dumpster. Brigitte sulks.

          GINGER
          What.

          BRIGITTE
          We never do what I wanna do.

          GINGER
          Oh, c' mon. Would stink up the
          whole room!
          They hoist the dog up and dump it in the dumpster. It's hind
          end sticks out. Brigitte climbs into the dumpster, dragging
          it all the way in.
          Dusting herself off, Ginger notices some blood on her thigh.

          GINGER
          Nice.
          Ginger wipes at the blood with her hand. More appears. She
          lifts up the hem of her skirt. Her face falls. She looks
          around. She slips her fingers up to her crotch. Her hand
          comes out bloody.

          GINGER
          Bee. I JUST got the curse.
          Brigitte stops rooting garbage over the dog.

          BRIGITTE
          Serious?
          Ginger wiggles her wet fingers at her.

          GINGER
          We gotta go home.

          BRIGITTE
          Eeew, 'kay.
          Brigitte catches her kilt on a nail sticking out of a plank
          in the trash.
          Something is crunching through the leaves toward them. Ginger
          peers out into the darkness.

          

          

          

          

           24

          GINGER
          Hurry upt

          BRIGITTE
          I'm stuck3
          A few homes down, a garage's motion-sensitive security lamp
          trips on. Ginger squints, blinded.

          GINGER
          Bee?:
          Brigitte contorts to deal with the nail. Brigitte tears her
          hem free and jumps down. The light snaps off.

          GINGER
          (indicating the
          opposite direction)
          Let's go this way.
          Brigitte dips a hand back into the dumpster for the plank
          with the nail. Off Ginger's look, Brigitte shrugs.
          They start walking down the lane. The greenery behind them
          starts swelling again. The leaves crunch, faster.
          Brigitte and Ginger look at one another, and walk faster. The
          lane empties behind a deserted strip mall.

          EXT. STRIP MALL LOT - NIGHT

          Whatever is behind them knocks an empty trash can over.
          Brigitte grabs Ginger's arm, scared.

          BRIGITTE
          This is stupid. We're getting
          farther from home.
          Ginger is pissed off now. she turns to confront their
          stalker.

          GINGER
          (to the darkness)
          All right you ass-/
          She's cut cold by a roaring blur of speeding fur and teeth
          and claws: SOMETHING takes Ginger down hard.
          We cannot see it as a whole, we can't make out what it is.
          It's big, heavy, and raging. Immense jaws snap vicious teeth,
          going for Ginger's jugular. Brigitte drops her plank.

          

          

          

          

           25

          GINGER & BRIGITTE

          BRIGITTE/GINGER!!!
          Brigitte grabs and kicks at the creature. Ginger raises her
          arms and covers her head, screeching and kicking. The thing
          grabs Ginger by the scruff and shakes the living daylights
          out of her.

          GINGER

          BEEEEEI HELP MEEE! BEEEEE!!!1!
          Brigitte snatches up the plank with the nails. Brigitte
          brings it down hard on the thing, screaming. She smacks it
          once, twice. The plank pops a shot off the camera: FLASH! A
          horrible set of jaws and one golden eye are caught for a
          split second in the light.
          The third hit evokes a yelp and the thing backs off,
          snarling.. Brigitte quakes with the board raised, ready. The
          thing skitters before her as she screams.
          Ginger scrambles to her foot and grabs Bee with bloodied
          hands.

          GINGER
          Go-go-go-go-go-go!!!!
          Brigitte drops the plank and they run like hell.. for a main
          thorough-way ahead. It pursues them.

          EXT. THE THOROUGH-WAY - NIGHT

          The late-night traffic is light but consistent. The thing is
          still, coming.
          At a dead run Brigitte and Ginger sail between moving cars.
          The thing burns behind them.
          The girls are barely missed by an approaching truck. There is
          a long blast of a horn.
          Then a sickening thud. Brakes squeal incto a stop as a
          horrible dragging/ scrain fills the night air.
          The girls crash to the sidewalk, spilling over top of one
          another. They glance over their shoulders, even as they
          disappear into a new residential stretch.
          The COUNTY REGREENING PROGRAM truck sits at a right angle in
          the road, it's front end smashed.

          

          

          

          

           26
          Sam slowly opens the cab door. He staggers to the bloody
          grill, clearly shaken.
          He looks under the truck, and follows a wet trail of gore
          back behind it to the mangled furry mass about twenty feet
          back. He takes it in, stunned.
          Then Sam vomits.

          INT. GIRLS BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Brigitte scrambles through the window and helps Ginger
          through after her. They're bloody, sweaty and tearful. They
          slump shaking, side by side on Ginger's bed, catching their
          breath.
          Brigitte notices the rivulets of blood trickling down
          Ginger's arms. Ginger's shirt is soaking with growing red
          stains.

          BRIGITTE
          Ginger, shit!
          Ginger looks at herself. Ginger starts to cry.

          GINGER
          The fuck was that, Bee?

          INT. ATTACHED BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Brigitte flings open the vanity and collects various first
          aid items: gauze, tape, band-aids, iodine. She snags a
          washcloth and wets it at the tap.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          I couldn't remember Ginger
          crying, ever.
          Brigitte flies out to,

          INT. GIRLS BEDROOM - NIGHT

          where Ginger is painfully pealing off her shirt, shaking and
          sobbing.
          Brigitte offers Ginger the wet cloth, but Ginger's helpless.

          

          

          

          

           27

          BRIGITTE
          Ginger, sshhh, don't, 'kay.
          Don't cry.
          Carefully, Brigitte begins to dab at Ginger's arms with it,
          wiping off the blood. Ginger flinches.
          The damage is gradually revealed: massive claw marks, deep
          scratches, and puncture wounds - BITE MARKS. Brigitte's eyes
          fill with tears.

          BRIGITTE
          Okay, this is really bad. You
          need a doctor, Ginge', I can't
          stop all the -/

          GINGER
          No! Not tellin' anybody! Bee?!
          Nobody. Get in shit for bein'
          out, smokin' up - don't tell.

          BRIGITTE
          What if you get, sick? What if
          these bites get infected?

          GINGER
          Bce!

          BRIGITTE
          Fine! I won't tell!
          Brigitte starts tearing off strips of gauze and taping it on
          thick. Oblivious, Ginger fumbles for a smoke. She can't get
          the lighter to work.

          GINGER
          Wanted to kill me! I could tell.

          BRIGITTE
          (giving into tears)
          I know, I know. I was so scared,
          I thought you were -/

          GINGER
          Me too. Don't say it. I know.
          Brigitte lights her smoke for her. Ginger takes a drag and
          passes it back to Brigitte.

          GINGER
          Fuck. You okay?
          Brigitte resumes her first aid.

          

          

          

          

           28

          BR IG ITTE
          Yeah, I'm okay.

          GINGER
          Why!?? Why me?

          BRIGITTE
          It was crazy, it was like rabid
          or somethin' -- Shit, look at the
          size of these bites!

          GINGER
          I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.
          Right? It's okay.
          Brigitte doesn't look convinced. Brigitte snaps the port of
          an internal vacuum system open and reaches into the tube.
          She withdraws a sample-size of Jack Daniels.

          BRIGITTE
          Drink this.
          Ginger glugs some down, and passes the last mouthful left to
          Brigit.t.e. Brigitte waves it. away, -,o Ginger finishes it al.l.

          BRIGITTE
          I seen this thing, on bears?
          Said bears'd come after like,
          chicks on the rag. 'Cause of
          the smell.

          GINGER
          Wasn't my fault!

          BRIGITTE
          I didn't say that.../

          GINGER
          Wasn't a f uckin' bear either.
          Whatever it was, it wasn't a
          bear!

          BRIGITTE
          I know, I'm not /

          GINGER
          Do I stink? Can you smell it?

          BR IG ITTE
          No! Geez, I was jus', whatever.
          A heavy silence falls between them. Brigitte keeps working.

          

          

          

          

           29

          GINGER
          Doesn't feel anythin' like
          peeing your pants, by the way.

          BRIGITTE
          It doesn't?

          GINGER
          It's gross though. It's really
          gross. I better, ya know, deal
          with that...

          BRIGITTE
          Yeah, sure.
          Ginger's only half-bandaged up. she staggers to the bathroom
          and shuts the door. Brigitte eyes the Polaroid camera: a
          picture sits ready to be dispensed.
          She pulls it free. We do not see the photo. Brigitte's eyes
          bug out as she examines it.
          The toilet flushes in the bathroom and Brigitte pushes the
          photo under the pillow on her bed. Shaking her head.

          BRIGITTE (V/0)
          It was blurry. It was really
          outta focus, so. Ya couldn't
          TELL it was really anything.
          Ginger emerges pulling uncomfortably at her crotch. she
          climbs painfully onto her bed, and collapses.

          GINGER
          That booze - straight to my
          head, man.

          BRIGITTE
          You really okay?
          Ginger-es eyes are already fluttering shut.

          GINGER
          You saved me. Love you. Bee.
          Brigitte leans in, listening to Ginger breathe.

          BRIGITTE
          Me too, Ginge'.

          

          

          

          
          GINGER SNAPS- WALTON/July 15. 1996 30

          INT. GIRLS' BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Brigitte sits straight up in bed, sweating, with eyes wide.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          I woke up later, I thought the
          thing was in our room.
          Brigitte peers at Ginger: she's snoring. Brigitte pulls out
          the Polaroid and fires up her lighter to see by. This time we
          see it too. A streak of fur, fangs and a golden glinting eye.

          BRIGITTE (CON'T-V/0)
          Then I remembered Sam the tree
          planter killed it with his
          truck, an' we were okay.
          .But really, Ginger -? well.
          Wasn't.

          EXT. BAILEY HIGH GROUNDS - DAY

          It's noon hour. The grounds are full. of teens.
          Brigitte is eating as she ticks off the fourth day in
          Ginger's feminine hygiene calendar. Brigit:Le counts 28 days
          from the first check mark. Her pen hovers over the date:
          Halloween, arid the next full moon. The first day was a full
          moon. Brigitte slowly circles them both.
          Ginger wears long sleeves to hide her bandages, and shades.
          She's looking BOYS up and down as they pass. Ginger's stomach
          is growling. An untouched sandwich sits on her lap.

          BRIGITTE
          Gonna eat that?
          Ginger shakes her head as she picks at her bandages. Brigitte
          helps herself.

          BRIGITTE
          Mmm! Sad, but Pamela's egg salad
          is her best thing. Like that she
          can do.
          (no response)
          Like, when she puts the baby
          onions in?
          (no response)
          And she gobs on it and adds
          those hard little pieces of

          BOOGER
          Ginger pulls at her own crotch.

          

          

          

          

           31

          BRIGITTE
          Hell-o 1?

          GINGER
          Sorry. Pads suck, so ya know.

          BRIGITTE
          Should eat something.

          GINGER
          Thanks Pamela, I'm aware.
          Off Brigitte's insulted look,

          GINGER
          T dunno, I'm all blaaahh, I got
          this, like I can taste what I
          want, but nothin's it. Ya know?
          Brigitte stops in mid-chew.

          BRIGITTE
          A craving?

          GINCER
          Yeah. I crave. Ya know?
          Brigitte chews very slowly as she stares at Ginger. Ginger
          squints at Jason and his pals across the yard.

          GINGER
          McCardy's a stoner right?

          BRIGITTE
          Yeah -?

          GINGER
          C'mon, I wanna feel better.

          BRIGITTE
          You joke.
          Ginger heads off toward the boys - without waiting. Brigitte
          is in mid-,mouthful, and has to scramble to catch up.

          EXT. BAILEY HIGH GROUNDS/SCHOOL STEPS - DAY

          Jason and his pals' butcho conversation sputters as Ginger
          strides up like a cat in heat. Brigitte stumbles up behind
          her, keeping her distance.

          

          

          

          
          GINGER SNAPS - WALTON/July 15, 1998 32

          JASON
          Uh - hi.

          GINGER
          Hey. So. Nice day, blah blah
          blah. Got any smoke?

          JASON
          What?

          GINGER
          Smoke. Grass, weed, dope, green,
          bud, Nancy.

          JASON
          Sh-sure.

          GINGER
          Wanna share?

          EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

          Brigitte hesitates before a rusted-out old boogie van, it's
          rear door open and waiting. Blue smoke billows out. of the
          interior. Brigitte looks confused.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          I was all like, so who are you,
          an' what have you done with my
          sister, right?
          Brigitte climbs in.

          INT. VAN - DAY

          Ginger, Jason, Tim, Frank and Jeremy sit toking a gagger. The
          guys are giddy with lust. Brigitte is huddled in a corner,
          attempting invisibility.
          Jason hands Ginger the joint, making sure their fingers
          touch.

          JASON
          Hey. I thought your slide show
          in art was cool.

          OTHER GUYS
          Oh yeah/Unh-huh/Very cool.

          GINGER
          Yeah?

          

          

          

          

           33
          Jason and Ginger exchange a coy smile that makes Brigitte
          toke really hard on her pass.
          Brigitte passes the dube to Tim, who winks at her. Brigitte
          sneers and looks at her watch. She makes a pained face at
          Ginger, but is ignored.

          GINGER
          This home-grown?

          JASON
          Yeah. This guy we know? Learned
          hydrophonics in the pen, man.

          BRIGITTE
          HydroPONics.

          JASON
          Yeah, whatever.
          Brigitte gapes at Ginger, who does not respond. Brigitte
          hides beneath her hair and presses even further into a
          corner. She starts quietly ripping up the corner of the old
          shag rug.
          There is a codified knock on the vain door. Brigitte jumps.

          JASON
          speak of the devil. Enter!
          The back doors open and Sam (the tree planter) stands in
          silhouette, backlit by the day. His battered county truck
          waits behind him. He has a pit bull with him - MORELY.

          BOYS
          Sam the Man! Hey Morely!
          Sam and Morely hop in and close the doors. Brigitte is frozen
          at the sight of Sam up so close.

          TIM
          Whoa dude. What happened to
          your truck?

          SAM
          Shit. Had an accident on the
          403. It was weird it../
          Morely stomps into Brigitte's lap, sniffing her crotch.

          

          

          

          

           34

          SAM
          (to Brigitte)
          Sorry about him, he's an ass
          hole. Morely! My girlfriend's,
          she won't leave him at home
          alone any more. Ya know, dog
          killers. Morely, no! Sit!
          Brigitte's mouth is hanging open. Morely slobbers all over
          her hands.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          I know, I look like an asshole.
          Ginger's perma-smug smile fades as she makes eye contact with
          Morely. Morel growls at her. Sam is about to resume his
          accident story when,

          JASON
          Watcha got for us?
          Sam produces several baggies of grass. Morely's hackles rise.
          Brigitte looks from the dog to Ginger, Ginger squirms.

          SAM
          New harvest, see whatcha think.
          (to Morely)
          What's your problem? Never seen
          a pretty girl before?
          Ginger sneers at Morely and Morely bares his teeth.

          JASON/TIM/FRANK
          (digging out cash)
          Thanks, man.
          Morely bursts out barking and charges at Ginger.
          Mayhem as the guys try to contain the dog in the small space.
          Jason uses the opportunity to shield Ginger for a free body
          press. Brigitte gets banged and shoved.
          Ginger kicks and screams at the dog, her boot connects
          squarely with his snout. Morely keels back, and Sam snaps
          him up.

          SAM
          Sorry, he's not really like
          this. I'm really sorry.

          GINGER
          Jus' get'im out!

          

          

          

          

           35

          SAM
          I'm really - well, see you guys.
          And in another flash of daylight, Sam and Morely are gone.
          Brigitte looks longingly at the closed door.
          The stone has set in, and everyone but Brigitte giggles as
          they settle. Brigitte takes in the Lesser Mortals like
          they're lepers.

          JASON
          You okay?

          GINGER
          Yeah. Just hate dogs.
          They give one another this corny smile. Brigitte bugs her
          eyes at Ginger. Ginger rises reluctantly.

          GINGER
          Well. Thanks for the smoke.

          JASON
          Maybe we could --/
          Ginger places a finger to her lips, then makes a finger gun
          and shoots him.

          GINGER
          I'll letcha know.
          Ginger grins ear-to-ear, elbowing Brigitte. Ginger kicks the
          van doors open and saunters out. Brigitte :Follows, trying not
          to laugh.

          INT. SCHOOL CAN - DAY

          Brigitte stands stoned out of her bean in the girls'
          washroom. She imitates Ginger's cavalier farewell from the
          last scene.

          BRIGITTE
          I'll letcha, I'll jus' let-choo
          know. Bud. .So Ginger. Wanna
          tell me about you and like, the
          planet yer currently visiting?
          No answer. Brigitte squints at the tampon dispenser next to
          her. She tries to work it without putting money in. She
          smacks her dry lips. Brigitte bends over the sink and drinks
          from the tap.

          

          

          

          
          GINGER SNAPS- WALTON/July 15, 1996 36

          GINGER (O/S)
          Bee-?
          Brigitte doesn't hear her over the roar of the tap in her
          face. It shuts off automatically over her gaping mouth.
          Brigitte puts her finger up the spout and almost gets it
          stuck.

          GINGER
          Bee!

          BRIGITTE

          (STARTLED)
          Yeah!

          GINGER
          Com'ere-!
          Brigitte shuffles to the wrong door, opens it and finds it
          empty. She giggles and moves to the next one.

          BRIGITTE
          That smoke fucked me _up._ up.
          Brigitte finds Ginger with her shirt and all, the bandages
          peeled off. she is dabbing at herself with wads of toilet
          paper.
          The scratches and bites are oozing a clear gelatinous goo,
          under which a fine film of dark hairs have sprouted.
          Brigitte steps into the stall agape. The door hits her on the
          way in.

          INT. BATHROOM STALL - DAY

          Ginger and Brigitte stand nose to nose in the stall. Brigitte
          has not fully closed the door. Ginger is just as stoned as
          Brigitte.

          BRIGITTE
          Geez that's not right.

          GINGER
          1 didn't think.

          BRIGITTE
          What's the sticky stuff?

          GINGER
          I dunno.

          

          

          

          
          GINGER SNAPS - WALTON/July 15, 1996 37
          Brigitte carefully rubs a finger over the fuzzy hair in the
          wounds.

          BRIGITTE
          Oooh. Tickly.

          GINGER
          I got it on my tits too, look.

          BRIGITTE
          Weird. Does it hurt?

          GINGER
          No, it's itchy. I can't have a
          hairy chest Bee, that's fucked.

          BRIGITTE
          Yeah, like forget that tattoo
          you wanned.

          GINGER
          This sucks.

          BRIGITTE
          Quito badly.
          The idiocy of the looks of awe on the other's face makes them
          both crack up.

          GINGER

          (LAUGHING)
          This isn't funny.

          Stop, I'm serious. Think about
          it.
          Ginger stops laughing long enough to let the suggestion
          settle.

          

          

          

          

           38

          GINGER
          That's so stupid!
          They both burst into gales again. There is a sound outside
          the stall, as

          INT. BATHROOM PROPER - DAY

          The Trinas prance in to powder their noses. The Trina grabs
          the first stall door -- Brigitte and Ginger's.
          Brigitte and Ginger stand frozen like the proverbial deer in
          headlights. Trina does not see Ginger's transformation. But
          Ginger Is just doing her top up.

          TRINA
          Eeeew!
          Trina backs away, her hands to her mouth.

          TRINA
          Gawd: They're lesbos!

          CLONES
          Feeeewww!!
          Brigitte smacks her forehead. Ginger steps out and leers at
          Trina, licking her lips in a grotesque mock-lust. The Trinas
          shrink back against the farthest wall.

          GINGER
          Yeah, who's next? I'm still
          sticky!
          Brigitte's jaw drops. Ginger turns to leave and the Trinas,
          start to relax. Ginger whips around again:

          GINGER

          Rrr-uf, ruf, rr-of-rufrf

          TRINAS

          (SHRIEK)
          Ginger gives the Trinas a good dead-eyed stave, and walks
          out. Brigitte stumbles out after her.

          INT. BIOLOGY LAB - DAY

          Today's assignment is hacking up little pig feti.

          BRIGITTE (O/S)
          'Course Trina din't waste any
          time.
          Trina stares Brigitte down as she folds up a note and passes
          it to a classmate. It is read and passed on by every kid in
          the room during this scene.
          Brigitte holds her scalpel over the over their piggy -
          hesitating. Ginger's attention is riveted on the little
          carcass.

          BRIGITTE
          They're all looking at us.

          GINGER
          So?
          Ginger looks up at Jason, who is reading the note. Jason
          smiles at Ginger and destroys the note. Trina seethes.
          Ginger grabs the knife from Brigitte. she makes a deep
          incision in the pig's belly.

          BRIGITTE
          So! You're growing fur an,
          acting like a nut, is so!
          Ginger spies two girls giggling at her. Using both hands
          Ginger cracks the carcass. wide open like a clam. Ginger digs
          in, gouging out the pig's parts with her bare hands. Ginger
          breaks into a sweat, her breathing gets heavy.
          Brigitte cautiously looks around at their classmates. she
          moves to shield Ginger from prying eyes.

          BRIGITTE
          Um. Ginger-?

          GINGER
          hold on, I'm goi.n' for the
          brain.
          Ginger has begun scraping away at the pig's cranium with her
          finger nails. A sickening creak, snap, and the brain is
          exposed. Ginger - unconsciously - licks her fingers as she
          admires its frontal lobe.

          Brigitte fights a ralph.

          BRIGITTE
          Can't believe you did that!

          GINGER
          Hunh? What?
          Before Brigitte can answer, Ginger lifts the brain out on her
          finger tips, gently pushes Brigitte out of her way and...
          Whap! The brain lands squarely on Trina's head. Trina
          screams.

          GINGER
          Ha-ha! Bull's eye!

          BIO TEACHER
          Ginger Fitzgerald! Hall, NOW!

          GINGER
          What, it slipped!
          As Ginger stomps out with the teacher. Brigitte and Trina
          gape at one another.

          INT. GYNECOLOGIST'S EXAMINING ROOM - DAY


          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          That week, Ginger was all over
          the map. She was the goddamn
          schizo poster girl. She forgot
          the gyno guy. I couldn't believe
          she forgot. She promised.
          Brigitte is dying a thousand deaths on the examining table
          with her feet in stirrups. The GYNECOLOGIST is examining
          her.
          A NURSE stands next to him, smiling benignly as she passes
          him the contraption used to take a pap smear. Brigitte is
          almost in tears.

          CUT TO:
          Same moment in the examination procedure, but now Ginger is
          in the stirrups. And the doctor is shocked at his findings.

          GYNO
          What the -?

          

          

          

          

           41

          INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Brigitte gives Ginger a pout as they both shift uncomfortably
          in their seats.
          The doctor is gulping cups of water from the water cooler,
          his hand shaking. He talks to Pamela like the girls aren't
          even there.

          GYNO
          I've never seen anything like
          it. She's not built like a
          normal girl. I've sent samples
          to the lab. But this is very,
          VERY unusual.
          Brigitte pokes Ginger in the ribs. Ginger doesn't like this,
          and pushes Brigitte so hard she almost falls off her chair.

          PAMELA
          Girls, please.

          INT GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT
          The window is open. Norman the terrier yams.
          Ginger is in a tank shirt which reveals her hair growth is
          spreading. Brigitte is sitting at. the desk with a pile of
          monster books.

          GINGER
          What're you, nuts? I got a skin
          thing, whatever.

          BRIGITTE
          If you just gotta skin thing why
          does it get worse everytime yer
          being a bitch? Why's the gyno
          say you're a monster inside?

          GINGER
          He din't say that!

          BR I G ITTE
          Just listen to these symptoms!

          GINGER

           42
          Ginger slams the bathroom door shut. Brigitte consults her
          books, and the feminine hygiene calendar 10 days are
          ticked off. Norman the terrier barks on.

          "The key to his survival is a

          the key to his own demise,

          INT. GIRLS' ATTACHED BATH - MEANWHILE/NIGHT

          Ginger is in the shower. she runs shaking hands over her
          body. Ginger hears Norman's barking as super-amplified.
          Its persistence is making her mental.

          BRIGITTE (V/0 - CON'T)
          ".. .for eventually the blood-
          lust over-takes human reason,
          overtakes oven the instinct for
          self-preservation, and he will
          risk all for the excitement of
          the euphoric high of his
          murders."
          Ginger shaves the delicate area around her ankles. She cuts
          herself and freaks. Ginger snaps the Lady Bic in half and
          throws the pieces hard against the shower wall.

          GINGER
          Fuck fuck fuck FUCK
          There are two other broken razors in the stall, stuffed with
          hairs. Blood mixes with the water and swirls around her
          toes.

          INT. GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

          The doq is still barkin .outside. Brigitte closes her book.

          BRIGITTE (V/0)
          But see all the books and movies
          an' shit said it had to be a
          full moon, that it'd be all at
          once. An, ya know, not one word
          about chick werewolves on the
          rag. Typical.

          

          

          

          

           43
          Ginger flings open the door, tears to the window, hauls
          herself out and is gone. Brigitte is after her in a heart
          beat.

          EXT. YARD NEXT DOOR - NIGHT

          Ginger is over the fence with ease. Norman barks more,
          harder.

          EXT. FITZGERALD YARD - MEANWHILE/NIGHT

          Brigitte can't vault the fence. She clambers up a shared tree
          at the fence line to see.
          Ginger tries to grab the dog but he dances around her,
          barking like crazy. She grabs his snout with her bare hands
          and he bites her hard.

          GINGER
          Sonnovabitch!
          Now livid, Ginger takes up a dead tree branch.
          Up in the tree, Brigitte hides her face in her hands.
          Ginger (:racks the stick over the dog's head. The yelping
          stops but Ginger keeps hitting. Blood splatters over her
          face. And Ginger tastes it.
          Ginger drops her stick. She drags the body into the hedge
          next to the fence.
          Brigitte lowers her hands from her eyes. Ginger is directly
          below her, concealed from the house by the shrubs.
          Ginger falls to her knees before the corpse. She lifts a
          rattling hand to touch him. She lowers her face to the bloody
          mess. She's sweating, vibrating, physically resisting an
          irresistible drive. Ginger's tongue slips between her lips.
          And Ginger licks Morely's body.

          BRIGITTE
          Oh. No. G-ginger -!
          Ginger begins to eat the dead dog. The feed. quickly becomes
          a ravenous frenzy.
          Above her, Brigitte leans over the branch she's barely
          balancing on, hyperventilating.
          Vomit sails down from Brigitte's perch.

          The porch light comes on behind Ginger.

          BR IG ITTE
          Shit.
          Brigitte scrambles down the tree and yanks Ginger off the
          dog. Ginger's face is smeared in blood. Ginger's stunned, and
          reels dizzily. They crouch, waiting.
          Their NEIGHBOR opens the screen door, shaking a box of dog
          biscuits.

          NEIGHBOR
          Dore-maan! Tweat-time! Hunh.
          The neighbor steps into the yard. Approaches the hedge.
          Stops right before them - they can see a pair of slippers
          twitching in the grass. Then they disappear, the porch light
          switches off, the screen door shuts.

          INT. GIRLS' BEDROOM - LATER SAME NIGHT

          Brigitte sits staring into space. Ginger is showering in the
          attached bath.

          window... Arf-Arf!

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          Ever been too sick to be sick?
          Like the bottom of your stomach
          is wrapped over the top of your
          head?
          There is a knock at the door. Brigitte checks the dead bolt
          is on.

          BR IGITTE
          Yeah?!

          PAMELA (O/S)
          Who's showering so late?

          BRIGITTE
          Ginger!

          PAMELA(O/S)
          Why?

          

          

          

          

           45

          BRIGITTE
          she's dirty?!
          Brigitte throws up her hands: what an idiotic conversation.

          PAMELA (01S)
          Dirty!? How'd she get/

          BR IG ITTE
          I'm tryin' to study, here!

          PAMELA (01S)
          oh, all right then.
          Brigitte slumps against the door. The showers stops.
          Ginger appears in a towel, pink and clean and freshly furry
          in places. She's in a really good mood. She takes one look
          at Brigitte's face of doom and tries to be serious.

          GINGER
          I couldn't help it. Really.
          Guess you were right.
          Ginger finds and lights a smoke.

          GINGER
          You know what's really weird?

          BRIGITTE
          Weirder than KILLING A DOG AND

          EATING IT???!!

          GINGER
          I liked it. I liked it a lot. I
          feel all fucki.n' goofy now.
          Like, I dunno. Like .happy?
          Brigitte shakes her head over and over.

          GINGER
          I feel like I just got off the
          Planet Smasher ride at WarWorid,
          okay? It rules!
          Ginger leaps to the stereo and blasts on some tunes. She
          flails around the room wildly. Ginger grabs Brigitte by the
          arms and makes her dance too. Ginger spins and spins
          Brigitte, who fights it but laughs.

          So she'd killed Norman. 1 never
          seen anyone bliss out like that.
          I wanted to be so blissed, jus'
          once.
          There is repeated pounding on their door. Brigitte still
          entangled in Ginger, hits the music off.

          PAMELA (O/S)
          Little late for that, girls.

          GINGER/BRIGITTE
          (Bite me:)/Sorry;
          They stand in each other's arms listening to Pamela mount the
          stairs OFF SCREEN.
          Ginger shoves Brigitte backward onto her bed. Ginger piles
          on top of her, playfully pinning her down.

          GINGER
          I want more.
          Brigitte squirms fitfully.

          BR IG ITTE
          No, it's too gross! You'll get
          caught.

          GINGER
          Not if you help. Bee. I'm
          starving.
          Brigitte looks into her sister's beaming face.

          GINGER
          Jus' keep watch. Look, I'm gonna
          be somethin' totally else. Tell
          me you don't so dig it. Tell me
          you don't wanna see what
          happens.
          Brigitte groans.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          Straight up? Crazy's contagious.
          Trust me.

          EXT. VARIOUS STREETS & YARDS - VARIOUS NIGHTS

          Bailey Downs sleeps soundly as the hunt begins. The moon is a
          sliver of its former self.
          Ginger cocks her head at the sound of a dog barking. She
          lifts her nose into the wind and sniffs. Ginger is prowls
          like a wild cat through yards and service lanes, as
          A study in much less stealth, Brigitte stumbles, trips and
          slips after Ginger. Splits her sweats climbing fences. Loses
          a shoe over garage roofs, gets caught in automated lawn
          sprinklers, falls into hidden cellar window troughs, as
          A series of dogs perk their ears and snarl from their dog
          houses, chains, and porch perches...
          Low whistles and smoochy sounds lure the dogs into bushes,
          behind cars, around fences. Strings of dogs' chains strain
          tight, then slacken...
          Ginger - wild-eyed, bloody-mouthed, and euphoric - tosses
          collars at Brigitte. Brigitte misses most of the tosses. She
          picks up the collars and fingers these souvenirs with
          disgust.

          EXT. A BACK YARD - DAWN

          A LITTLE KID decked out for hockey practice waddles into his
          yard with a full dog food dish. His feet squish along his
          pet's entrails. He finds his dog's body and drops the dish
          with a clatter on the cement patio.

          The moon vanishes, then reappears in as a First Quarter, as
          Brigitte's getting the hang of things, she practices expert
          surveillance from car roofs, throws stones to trip motion-
          sensitive lamps, starts moving like a super spy, taking
          crime-scene style Polaroids of their victims, as

          Ginger's kills get quicker, she gets wilder, more daring,
          more ruthless, and...
          Brigitte gets cooler, confident, collected. She's mapping out
          attack routes and leading the frothing Ginger to the big
          scores, like dog kennels...

          EXT. BAILEY HIGH SPORTS FIELD - NIGHT

          Under a swelling moon Brigitte and Ginger tear around in the
          dark, screaming and laughing and rough-housing.

          INT GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT
          Brigitte shoves a fist-full of collars under their
          mattresses.

          JUMP BACK TO:
          On the field, Ginger climbs up on the goal post and walks
          carefully across the narrow beam.

          JUMP TO:

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          The crazier she got, the more
          she needed me. I liked that
          part.
          In their room, Brigitte helps Ginger shave her back. Ginger
          trims her elongating nails. Brigitte plucks hairs from
          Ginger's palms. Ginger brushes her teeth and a piece of tooth
          comes off - she has a little fang.

          JUMP TO:
          on the field both Brigitte and Ginger hang upside down from
          the goal post by their knees. Brigitte is wearing a dog
          collar as a necklace. They are laughing their heads off and
          trying to pull each other's shirts down to expose each
          other's breasts.

          INT. GIRLS' BEDROOM - DAWN

          Ginger holds her mattress up while Brigitte stuffs handfuls
          of the collars underneath. They collapse, exhausted. Ginger
          crawls on her hands and knees to the toilet in the

          INT. ATTACHED BATH - DAWN

          Ginger drinks out of the toilet like a dog.

          INT. GIRLS' BEDROOM - MEANWHILE/DAWN

          Ginger burps loudly and crawls back to join her sister, who
          offers her a cigarette.

          GINGER
          You love it.
          Brigitte examines the feminine hygiene calendar. In it, a
          cartoon of a female egg is personified with a heels and
          sunglasses, strutting across the date.

          BRTGITTE
          trey, look yer ovulating.
          Ginger rubs her belly.

          GINGER
          I'm still hungry, Bee.

          BRIGITTE
          How can you - you've done every

          It's not enough. I want

          EXT. BAILEY HIGH - DAY

          All the kids lounging on the grounds double-take the
          Fitzgerald girls' entrance this morning.
          Ginger is babe-alicious in a hot tiny tee, boots, shades and
          very short shorts. She projects unbearably untouchable.
          Brigitte flanks her without the wardrobe, but the attitude is
          there.

          

          

          

          

          

          GINGER SNAPS -WALTON
          Jason gapes as Ginger heads toward him with an unlit smoke
          between her pointy teeth. She leaves an inch between his
          chest and her breasts.

          GINGER
          Got a light, Jace'?
          Jason and his pals all fumble for lighters and five little
          flames appear before her smoke. She lights her smoke on
          Jason's, and exhaling looks him up and down. The boys flames
          go out, all at once.

          GINGER
          My sister would like one also.
          obediently, they all light up for Brigitte. Brigitte falters
          before the attention. At Ginger's nod, Brigitte lights up
          too.

          TRINA (O1S)
          Slut.
          Ginger turns to see Trina and the Clones sizing her up.

          GINGER
          Excuse me?
          Ginger seems to tower over the Trinas today. Trina can't
          match the menace. Ginger exhales smoke in Trinals face and
          climbs the steps into the school.
          Brigitte double-takes Ginger's back. Ginger's spine is
          protruding sharply through her shirt. Trina leers at
          Brigitte.

          TRINA
          Better watch your back,
          Fitzenstein.
          Brigitte snorts and follows Ginger in.

          BRIGITTE
          (under her breath)
          Like I'm scared.

          INT ENGLISH CLASS - DAY
          Ginger chews her nails like a dog does when cleaning them.
          Brigitte and the rest of the class watch an RCMP OFFICER
          holding a reward poster at the front of the room.

          Ha! As if they weren't already.

          OFFICER (CON'T)
          But your pets aren't safe until
          the perpetrator is caught.
          Ginger sighs loudly and Brigitte prods her.

          EXT. BAILEY HIGH SPORTING FIELD - DAY

          The girls' gym class is prepping for lacrosse again. The
          Trinas square off across the half-way mark from Ginger. Mz.
          Sykes blows her whistle. The scrimmage begins.
          Trina whips the Indian rubber ball right into Ginger's face.
          Ginger drops her stick and launches herself at Trina.
          Play stops with the whistle, but Ginger and Trina are just
          going at it. Ginger's winning. Trina bites Ginger's sore arm
          and Ginger rakes her nails over Trina's neck.. Ginger draws
          blood.
          Mz. Sykes breaks it up by dragging Ginger off Trina. Sykes
          tends to Triria, who bawls.
          Ginger wipes her bloody hand over her mouth.

          BRIGITTE
          Ginger!
          Ginger's rolling the taste of Trina's blood around in her
          mouth.

          SYKES
          Fitzgerald, bench!

          GINGER
          What, she started it!
          Brigitte watches Ginger march to the sidelines, throwing off
          her gear as she goes.

          SYKES
          Pick that stuff up!
          Ginger gives Sykes the finger without looking back. Brigitte
          groans.

          INT. BAILEY HIGH HALLS - DAY

          Brigitte waits outside a door marked GUIDANCE.
          Trina struggles by with the help of her clones. Trina sports
          a big ugly bandage on her neck, knees and an arm in a sling.
          She shoots Brigitte a Death Stare.

          TRINA
          Yer bitch sister's dead, freak.

          BRIGITTE
          (under her breath)
          Fuck off.
          Jason lopes up. He indicates the guidance office door.

          JASON
          Ginger in there again?
          Brigitte ignores him.

          JASON
          Cool. Um. Look, Belinda...

          BRIGITTE
          Brigitte.

          JASON
          Right, right. T'd really like to

          guess.
          Brigitte seethes.

          JASON
          Fuck. Never mind, I'll ask her
          myself.
          (under his breath)
          Freak.
          Jason takes a post on the opposite Brigitte to wait. Brigitte
          glares at him.

          INT. GUIDANCE OFFICE - DAY

          The grossly over-weight guidance councilor, MR. WAYNE, is
          perched on the edge of his fake wood desk, holding their
          death slides (from the credit sequence) up to the fluorescent
          light. His arm pits are stained with sweat.
          Ginger slumps in a chair before him. There is a fish bowl
          full of condoms on his desk. Ginger picks one out, unwrapping
          it, examining it as he talks.

          MR. WAYNE
          Look, you keep getting sent
          here. We might as well be
          friendly.

          GINGER
          I don't do friendly, Mr. Wayne.

          MR. WAYNE
          Hey. I know where you're coming
          from. I was a kid once too.

          GINGER
          Really? So was I. Weird.
          Ginger fakes an eye-lash batting smile. She winds the condom
          over her erect fingers.

          MR. WAYNE
          Okay, you aren't a kid. You're a
          young adult. With some issues.
          Let's explore them.

           Ginger rubs the condom's lubricant between her two free
          fingers, intrigued by the texture.

          MR. WAYNE
          Hey. I'm reaching out here.
          Your plays for attention are a
          cry for help, aren't they?

          GINGER
          Uh, no.

          MR. WAYNE
          Is it a problem at home? With
          your parents?

          GINGER
          They think I'm cute.
          Mr. Wayne sighs.

          Maybe I ought to split you and
          your sister up.

          antagonistic, and now violent.

          young lady, I better like it.
          Ginger gives him a cold, dead stare.

          MR. WAYNE
          consider this your final
          warning. I see you outta line
          again, and we're talking
          expulsion. And don't look at me

          She pounds her fist into a locker and makes a dent. Brigitte
          cringes. Ginger admires the damage.

          Ginger notices Jason and visibly brightens.

          Jason and Brigitte's faces darken simultaneously.

          BRIGITTE
          Ginger, we should get home.

          GINGER
          No we shouldn't.
          Brigitte drags Ginger aside. Ginger notes Brigitte's hand
          squeezing her arm with a dangerous look.

          BRIGITTE
          Twenty minutes ago you coulda
          killed somebody. Is this really
          a good time to start dating? I

          Well, I do.

          BRIGITTE
          Why?

          GINGER
          Why?! Look, grow up a little an'
          maybe you'll get it

          BRIGITTE
          What.

          GINGER
          Forget it, I'm goin'. I'll draw
          ya a picture later, 'kay?
          Ginger takes Jason's hand and pulls him off to the exit.
          Jason gives Brigitte SUCH a smug look over his shoulder.
          Brigitte stands alone in the hall, gaping after them.

          EXT BAILEY HIGH - LATE DAY

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          When Henry renovated the
          basement, to build our room? I
          was like ten an, in the way an,
          shit. Well, he rammed iue with
          this beam, right in my stomach.
          Accidentally.
          Brigitte wanders over the emptying school. lot. She looks
          small and alone. She looks disoriented.

          BRIGITTE (CON'T-V/0)
          But all the air came outta my
          lungs at once an, I kept tryin'
          to breathe but I couldn't. I
          forgot all about that. Till like
          right now.
          Brigitte consults the hygiene calendar. Ginger's ending the
          third week of checked-off days. A special note on today's
          date asks DO YOU HAVE PMS?

          EXT. HILL CREST -- DUSK

          Jason's van is parked on a rise that offers an impressive
          overview of Bailey Downs. Crickets sing. The moon is rising.

          

          

          

          

           57

          INT. THE VAN - DUSK

          Ginger and Jason sit in the front seat of his van. They're
          making out. Ginger is enjoying herself. Ginger bites his lip.
          Ginger draws blood.

          JASON
          Ouch! whoa. Can't believe you
          never had a boyfriend...
          Ginger licks his blood from her own lips and freezes dead
          cold. Jason dives back at her for more. Ginger looks both
          aroused and unnerved by her arousal. Ginger's stomach growls.
          Ginger pushes Jason off of her.

          GINGER
          I have to go. It's getting late.

          JASON
          It's only six o'clock.
          Jason presses himself on her again. Ginger shoves him off,
          hard.

          GINGER
          1-have-to-go.

          JASON
          Oh. Now you get all moody on me?

          GINGER
          Hey_ You got no idea.

          EXT. HILLCREST - DUSK

          Ginger slams the van door and rushes away from the van.

          JASON (O/S)
          Chicks, yer all the same!
          Ginger stops in her tracks. She shakes her head and continues
          away.

          JASON (O/S)
          Cock tease!

          EXT. BAILEY STREET - DUSK

          Brigitte shuffles along the curb, the picture of dejection.
          She slows to watch Sam loading some enormous tree branches
          into the back of his truck, packing up for the night: lie has

          

          

          

          

           58
          been cutting back an enormous tree in someone's front yard.
          when Sam glances her way, Brigitte picks up her pace without
          looking back.

          EXT. PARK AREA - NIGHT

          Trina wears a radio headset that pounds post-disco dance mix
          as she jogs. Morely dashes in and out of the surrounding
          greenery. He dashes in once more, and does not reappear.
          Trina looks back expectantly. She runs in place, waiting for
          him. She heads back, looking for him.
          Ginger pops out of the brush before Trina. Gingers face
          smeared with blood from Mo.rely. Ginger grins insanely. Ginger
          wiggles Morely's collar. Trina clicks off her head set.

          GINGER
          Hi!

          INT FITZGERALD BUNGALOW - NIGHT
          Brigitte descends the stairs to her room. Music blasts from
          the basement.

          PAMELA (O/S)
          Brigitte? Tell your sister to
          turn that stereo down!

          INT. GIRLS' BEDROOM -- NIGHT

          Brigitte lets herself in. The music is now deafening. Trina
          is bound in a chair at the end of her bed, screaming her head
          off. Her screams are buried by the music. Brigitte slams and
          locks the door behind her.

          GINGER
          (yelling over noise)
          Stop screaming or I'll rip your
          permed head right off you neck.
          An' ya know what? I can do
          that. Now open wide
          Ginger force-feeds Trina something on a spoon. Trina screams
          with her mouth full, trying to spit it back out. Ginger
          offers Trina a glass of milk.

          GINGER
          Chaser? No?

          

          

          

          
          GINGER SNAPS-WALTON/July 15, 1996 59
          Blood trickles out of the corners of Trinas mouth as she
          chews while bawling. Ginger sets the glass of milk on the
          desk.

          BRIGITTE
          Ginger WHAT are you doing-!
          Ginger grins and shows Bee a bowl of crushed glass and tacks.

          GINGER
          Jus' like you said, Bee!
          S' perfect!
          Brigitte grabs the bowl away: glass shards and tacks rain
          around them.

          BRIGITTE
          Are you crazy?!

          GINGER
          Hey! I'm Join' this for you!
          As the sisters argue, Trina rocks the chair back and forth,
          trying to free herself.

          BR I G ITTE
          Oh no, no way... No!

          GINGER
          Yer still burnt over Jason!

          BR I G ITTE
          No, Ginger, I'm burnt 'cause you
          don't see like jail in yer
          future! You don't get how hugely
          fucked this is! DO you?
          Trina lurches back hard and rocks forward. Trina struggles to
          get her toes to meet the floor. She lurches back for more
          momentum.

          GINGER
          You sayin' I'm stupid?!

          BRIGITTE
          I'm sayin' she? Will tell on
          you! This is someone who will
          tell!
          Trina throws herself forward again and her toes connect
          firmly with the floor - just as her temple connects with a
          sickening CRACK on the sharp corner of the desk. The milk
          glass dumps on top of her.

          

          

          

          

           60
          Brigitte and Ginger look at her. Trina hangs there in the
          chair at this strange angle for a moment, dripping milk.
          Then Trina and the chair keel to the floor. Trina is still.
          Brigitte turns the music off and creeps up to Trina. Blood
          trickles out of Trina's ear and swirls into the milky glass
          mess at her mouth. Her open eyes stare at nothing. She's
          dead.

          GINGER
          Ha-ha.
          Ginger grabs her own right arm (most damaged by the original
          attack) and shudders with pain.

          GINGER
          Ow. Ow. Owchee-wow-ow.
          Brigitte takes Trina in from head to toe. Brigitte checks
          Trina for a pulse. Brigitte snaps her hand back as though it
          were burned. A tremor wracks Brigitte's body and she
          convulses. Brigitte runs to the bathroom. OFF SCREEN,
          Brigitte throws up.
          Meanwhile Ginger raises her afflicted hand. The hand is
          nowsomething clearly on the way to being a wolfen paw. The
          nails are black, curling claws.
          Oblivious, Brigitte climbs back into bed and covers her face
          with a pillow.

          BRIGITTE
          My life is basically over.

          GINGER
          Bee. ..BEE!
          Awestruck, they both watch as Ginger extends and retracts her:
          new set of claws.
          There is a knock at the door. The girls look at one another
          in mute horror. Ginger addresses the door.

          GINGER
          What!

          PAMELA (O/S)
          Are you two fighting?!

          GINGER
          -- No!

          PAMELA (O/S)
          come on then. Dinner's ready.
          Brigitte and Ginger hop up and down in a brief freak fit.

          GINGER (O/S)
          Coming!

          TNT FITZGERALD DINING ROOM - NIGHT
          Ginger has her new paw curled up in an over-sized sweat
          jacket sleeve. Brigitte stares at the stew before them with
          grave distaste. Pamela has a number of used tissues around
          her - she's been crying.

          HENRY
          The gynecologist called.
          Pamela grasps Ginger's gnarly arm and squeezes it through her
          sleeve. Brigitte and Ginger look at Pamela's hand.

          PAMELA
          There's something wrong, Ginger.
          He wants to do an ultra-sound!

          HENRY
          Pamela, don't scare her. How
          could the cells not be human
          cells? we'll send you to
          somebody else.

          PAMELA
          I'm sure your father's right.
          I'm just upset... How are you
          feeling, do you feel. all right?

          GINGER
          Um. sure. Fine.

          PAMELA
          (lowering her voice)
          No unusual discharge or anything
          like that?
          Henry, Brigitte and Ginger groan.

          PAMELA
          I worry, all right? I've made
          another appointment with a new
          doctor. Early next month was the
          earliest he could see you. okay?

          

          

          

          

           62

          GINGER
          okay.
          They all begin eating in silence. Except Brigitte who gags
          as Henry squirts ketchup all over his stew.

          EXT. NEIGHBOR'S YARD - NIGHT

          Trina's body is wrapped in a bedspread and stuffed in a kid's
          wagon. Brigitte is keeping a look out looking pale and
          sickened.
          Grass and dirt spray out of the playhouse. Ginger is digging
          up the ground inside doggie style. She emerges, shaking the
          turf out of her new paw.
          They struggle to get Trina inside, but she's already too
          stiff to bend up.

          GINGER
          Told you.

          BRIGITTE
          Rigor mortis. Knew we shoulda
          skipped dinner.

          GINGER
          Can we do it my way now?
          Brigitte hesitates, her anxieties rising.

          BR IG ITTE
          So is this it? You doin' people
          now?

          GINGER
          She won't fit unless I

          BRIGITTE
          But were you gonna?
          There is a long pause. Ginger tries to laugh it off with,

          GINGER
          No. I'm not doing people. No.
          Brigitte takes a deep breath, nodding. She acts belief.

          

          

          

          

           63

          BRIGITTE
          'Kay. .Hurry up.
          Ginger drags a section of the body into the playhouse with
          her. Disgusting gnashing and tearing, bones snapping and
          other sounds of devouring are heard from within.
          Brigitte keeps watch. Tears appear in her eyes.
          The body is dragged another foot into the playhouse. Ginger
          is eating Trina to make her fit in the grave.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          Trina was dead. Trina was
          dinner. This was BAD.An'I kept
          wonderin' what Sam was doin'
          right then. I couldn't help it,
          he jus' kept poppin' into my

          CUT TO BLACK.

          INT A FAMILY-SIZE FREEZER - DAWN
          Brigitte lifts the lid of a large freezer. OUR POV IS FROM
          INSIDE THE FREEZER. Its light illuminates the brown paper
          parcels Ginger sets inside, next to the frozen waffles and
          veggies. The parcels are labeled T-bone, T-thigh, T-breast.

          BRIGITTE (V/0)
          What Ginger couldn't finish we
          froze, 'cause the less we left
          for whoever would find Trina,
          the better. Watch a lot of crime
          TV, so.
          Brigitte's sizing Ginger up behind her back.
          Ginger finishes loading the freezer. Brigitte drops the lid.

          CUT TO BLACK.

          INT GIRLS' BEDROOM -- LATER THAT NIGHT
          The room is dark. Ginger is asleep.
          Brigitte is in bed with her back turned to Ginger's bed.
          Brigitte has a penlight on a collection of open monster
          books. She is examining a sketch of a plant with yellow
          flowers.

          Brigitte nearly jumps into orbit, slamming her book shut as
          Ginger appears over her shoulder.

          GINGER
          Hm. Big Book of Monsters, hunh.
          Thought they were useless.

          They are. Couldn't sleep. So.
          Rrigitte gives Ginger a nervous smile. Ginger smiles back.
          Her fangs show.

          INT. GIRLS' BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING

          Their alarm clock goes off reading 8:00 AM. Ginger's paw
          comes down hard on it, cracking the plastic casing.
          Brigitte is already up. She sweeps up the glass mess from the
          night before.
          Ginger rolls out of bed, steps over Brigitte and stumbles to
          the bathroom. Ginger steps on tacks and doesn't even react.

          GINGER
          Man, I'm not getting enough
          sleep.
          Ginger closes the bathroom door.
          Brigitte leaps to the door, looping one end of a noosed
          extension cord around the handle. The other end is tied to
          the door handle of the bedroom door. Brigitte checks to
          ensure the latter is bolted shut.

          open the door. She can't.

          GINGER(O/S)
          The fuck -? Beef
          Brigitte watches the vibrating length of cord hold the door
          firmly in place. Ginger bangs hard on the door.

          GINGER

          can. I`ll be back before dark.
          Brigitte tears the page with the plant out of her book and
          leaves by the window.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          Told Pammy Ginger wasn't feeling
          well. Just to get her checkin'

          EXT COUNTY GREENHOUSES - DAY
          Brigitte steps off a county bus at the drive.
          There's a police car parked next to the Sam's truck. She
          looks back to the bus, but the doors swing shut and it pulls
          away.
          Brigitte smoothes her hair, takes a deep breath, and over-
          acts innocent as she walks up.

          You know my girlfriend? Trina
          Sinclair?

          BRIGITTE
          Rinda.

          SAM
          You seen her today?

          

          

          

          
          GINGER SNAPS- WAI.TON/July 15, 1996 67

          BRIGITTE
          Not today...

          SAM
          Fuck. She's missing.

          BRIGITTE
          Oh. S-sorry.

          SAM
          Yeah, well. Cops think I know
          where she is. I don't.
           Sam looks Brigitte right in the eye. Brigitte is caught up in
          him for a second.

          SAM
          Sorry, what do you care right?
          What do you need.

          BRIGITTE
          Um. Lookin' for this.
          She holds out the torn page. Sam takes it.

          SAM
          Aconitum lycoctonum? Sorry.
          Brigitte yanks her own hair hard. Sam smiles.

          SAM
          Tryin' to kill somebody?
          (off her look)
          Well, you know it's poisonous,
          right? Wolfs bane? Deadly. Be
          like stocking hemlock an, shit.

          BRIGITTE
          No, I thought it did something
          else. Doesn't matter.

          SAM
          Anyways they're perennials -
          only flowers in spring.
          Brigitte turns to leave, hot with frustration, huinilliation.
          Sam watches her stamp toward the door.

          SAM
          Hey. Ranunculaceae come in about
          a hundred species. I've gotta
          cousin, monkshood. Not so toxic.
          If you're interested.

          

          

          

          

           66
          Brigitte stops and considers him.

          SAM
          Don't know if it'd help.

          INT GREENHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER
          They sit together amidst beautiful plants and flowers. Sam.
          picks a tiny purple flower from a bed of young plants and
          hands it to Brigitte.

          SAM
          S'called monkshood 'cause people
          used to think it kept 'em pure
          from dirty thoughts. Seriously.

          BRIGITTE

          (EARNESTLY)
          Make my life easier.
          Sam laughs. Surprised by this, Brigitte smiles and hides
          under her hair.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          This is awful. but the whole time
          I was with him there? I din't
          even think how I'd just put
          pieces of his girlfriend in the
          deep freeze, like, at all.

          INT. GIRLS' BEDROOM - DAY

          Ginger pulls with all. her might to get the door open a few
          inches. The door knobs on both doors are straining.
          Something starts to crack.
          With ferocious effort, Ginger contorts herself through two
          inches of space. The cracking is coming from Ginger as she
          squeezes her body bizarre-ly out of joint, as a contortionist
          might.
          Once through, she snaps and clicks her distended bones back
          in place. She gasps for breath. Her face is distorted with
          murderous fury.
          There is a knock on the bedroom door.

          PAMELA (O/S)
          Ginger, feeling any better?
          Ginger climbs noiselessly out of the window.

          

          

          

          

           69
          PAMELA (O/s)
          Ginger? You sleeping?...God, I
          hate this lock, I know it's-
          privacy but what if you were in
          trouble in there for god's sake?

          INT. BAILEY HIGH HALL - DAY

          Brigitte stands at her on locker, tying a rubber band
          around stalks of the monkshood. There is a goofy half-smile
          on her face, and she's humming.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          The book said dry it out before
          using it. I figured I'd keep
          Ginger locked up - feeding her
          Trina - till it was ready.
          she hangs the monkshood upside down in the locker. The
          buzzer goes as she slams the door shut.

          EXT. SERVICE LANE - DAY

          Ginger stalks past the neighbor's yard with the playhouse
          where Trina is buried.

          EXT. PLAYHOUSE YARD - DAY

          A new puppy romps. He sniffs around the edge of the
          playhouse. He smells something. He starts to whine and dig.

          INT. BAILEY HIGH - DAY

          Ginger stomps the deserted halls, with their class schedule
          in hand. Classes are in session. A fat silhouette appears-at
          the end of the corridor.

          WAYNE
          Fitzgerald. Tardy! My office

          NOW!
          Ginger faces him with a dreadful expression.

          

          

          

          

           70

          INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

          Brigitte slumps in her seat doodling. The RCMP officer is
          back, speaking to the class. The poster this time has a class
          photo of Trina.

          OFFICER
          If any of you have seen Trina
          please let us know. She went
          for a run this morning and has
          not returned or contacted her
          family or friends...

          INT. GUIDANCE OFFICE - DAY

          Ginger stands imposingly over Mr. Wayne in his chair.

          WAYNE
          Sit down, Ginger.

          GINGER
          I can't stay.

          WAYNF:
          I said, sit.

          GINGER
          An' I said ./

          WAYNE
          (cutting her off)
          You are expelled. This is not
          your personal playground, this
          is a school.

          GINGER
          Oh dear.

          INT. GUIDANCE OFFICE -- A FEW MINUTES LATER/DAY

          Ginger's good hand lifts the telephone receiver on Mr.
          Wayne's desk. With her wolfen paw she dials. In the
          background we see blood splattered over the walls.

          

          

          

          

           71

          GINGER (O/S)
          (imitating Pamela)
          Hello, main office? This is Mrs.
          Fitzgerald. would you page my
          daughter Brigitte please? I'm
          waiting to meet her in the
          guidance office. Thank you so
          much.

          INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

          Brigitte catches herself writing Sam's name on her binder.
          She scribbles it out, looking very guilty.

          PA SYSTEM (O/S)
          Would Brigitte Fitzgerald please
          report to guidance. Brigitte
          Fitzgerald.
          Brigitte freezes. The cop, the teacher, the whole class look
          at her. Brigitte scoops up her stuff.

          EXT. GUIDANCE OFFICE -- DAY

          Brigitte reaches the door and finds it locked. The door opens
          a crack and Ginger's transformed arm grabs Brig.iLLe, hauling
          her inside. The door slams shut and locks.

          INT. GUIDANCE OFFICE - DAY


          GINGER
          Don't ever fuck with me like
          that again.

          BRIGITTE
          You .got out.
          Brigitte gapes at all the blood. Ginger is very agitated.

          GINGER
          He asked for it. Was gonna expel
          me. So.
          Backing away, Brigitte trips over Mr. Wayne's foot sticking
          out from under the desk.

          GINGER
          What do we do, Bee? What do we
          do?

          

          

          

          

           72
          Brigitte sinks into a chair looking completely traumatized.
          Ginger hops about - charged by the kill.

          GINGER
          C'mon we need a fuckin' plan
          here!
          The school bell goes off. Brigitte snaps out of her daze,
          reaches up and hits the light switch off. They now sit in
          virtual darkness.

          BRIGITTE
          Last bell. wait till everyone
          goes. We'll stuff him someplace.
          Clean this up. I guess.
          The sound of the full halls around them seems very loud now.

          GINGER
          Bee, gotta a smoke?
          Brigitte hands her a smoke.

          GINGER
          Sorry about this.

          BRIGITTE
          Whatever.

          GINGER
          Don't be mad, ' kay?

          BRIGITTE
          I'm not mad.

          INT. BAILEY HIGH HALLS - LATER

          The school is deserted. The lock pops on the Guidance door
          and Brigitte and Ginger peer out. Nobody.

          BRIGITTE
          Stay here. Lock the door. I'll
          knock once.
          Ginger nods. Brigitte slips out and creeps down the corridor.
          Ginger shuts the door. Then Ginger whips it open again.

          BR IG ITTE
          Shut the door, Ginger!

          

          

          

          

           73

          GINGER
          Bee?

          BRIGITTE

          WHATI

          GINGER
          Thanks.
          Brigitte blinks at her, then continues to skulk away. The
          office door shuts and the lock locking reverbs after her.

          INT. ANOTHER HALLWAY - LATE DAY

          Brigitte walks fast, looking for a place for the body.
          She looks inside full garbage cans and sizes them up. Too
          small.
          She looks up at a loose ceiling panel. She jumps a few times
          trying to reach it. Too high. She gets an idea.
          Brigitte jogs past the sign directing us to gym.

          INT. GUIDANCE HALL - MEANWHILE

          A JANITOR pushes his cart toward the guidance office. He
          stops at another door, produces keys, and lets himself in.
          He returns with a trash can and empties into his bin. He
          replaces the can, closes the door and locks it.

          INT. GUIDANCE OFFICE - MEANWHILE

          Ginger, gnaws on Mr. Wayne's arm but really isn't enjoying
          it. She stops in mid-chew and listens. The janitor's
          footsteps approach: his cart wheels squeak

          INT. GUIDANCE HALL - DAY

          The janitor wheels up to the guidance office. He slides this
          key in the lock.

          INT. GUIDANCE OFFICE - DAY

          Ginger grips the door knob as best she can with her one good
          hand, her feet braced against the wall on either side.

          

          

          

          

           74
          On the other side, the janitor tugs, and tugs again.
          Ginger's getting madder the more he persists.
          The janitor gives the door one last wrench and it flies open.

          INT. GUIDANCE HALL - DAY

          Brigitte wheels a large cloth cart full of basket balls
          around a corner.
          The janitor crawls toward her, his hands lifted to her for
          help, blood spurting from his slashed throat. He tries to
          cry out, but only makes a gurgling whistle, the air in his
          Qi s passing through blood.
          Ginger walks behind him as he crawls. Ginger applies her boot
          to his ass and makes him slip face first in his own gore.
          Ginger giggles.
          Ginger looks up and sees Brigitte gaping in utter revulsion
          at her. For a split second, Ginger stops cold. Ginger seems
          to falter before her sister's horror.
          Then, without breaking their locked gaze, without even
          seeming conscious she's doing it - Ginger steps on the man's
          fingers and breaks them with a series of snaps.
          Brigitte tries to pry her eyes away, but can't.
          Still staring at Brigitte, Ginger extends her claws. Ginger
          shakes her head, as if to say I can't help it.. .Ginger
          pounces on the man. Brigitte turns her face to the wall.
          The lanitor makes a final horrible noise. The halls fall
          silent.

          MONTAGE: INT. SCHOOL - LATE DAY TO NIGHT

          as Brigitte stuffs Mr. Wayne into the gym basket and covers
          him with balls,
          Ginger runs madly up and down the halls screeching and
          whooping, slamming her monster arm into the lockers bashing
          them in.
          as Brigitte pushes the janitor's body into a ground level air

          VENT
          Ginger breaks the fire extinguisher out of it's case and
          unleashes foam into the halls.

          

          

          

          
          GINGER SNAPS -WALTON/July 15, 1996 75
          Brigitte mops up the janitor's blood with his own cart stuff.
          The Guidance office is already clean.
          Ginger lifts the fire extinguisher over her head. She starts
          running with it toward through the frosted glass window of
          the main office with a triumphant war whoop.
          Brigitte steps between Ginger and her target.

          GINGER
          Move!

          BRIGITTE
          STOP IT! Just stop. Enough,
          Ginger. Please. Please.
          Ginger throws the canister any way, forcing Brigitte to dive
          out of the way. SMASH! Glass rains down over. Brigitte.
          Brigitte lifts her head in time to see Ginger burn down the
          hall looking for more mischief.
          Brigitte curls into a fetal position, burying her face in her
          lap and rocks herself. Brigitte sobs.
          OFF-SCREEN we hear Ginger cont.inuing her ram a e else where
          in the school. Brigitte wanders up to the janitor's cart,
          looking like a plane crash survivor - dazed and wretched.
          Brigitte picks up a bottle of cleaning fluid. She sniffs it.
          She closes her eyes and tips it back. She washes it around in
          her mouth and lifts her chin to swallow. She spews it into
          the air, the taste making her heave instinctively. she dry
          heaves a couple of times. She throws the bottle at the wall.

          INT. SCHOOL - NIGHT

          Exhausted, Brigitte trails Ginger who is tired too, and
          heading for the exit. They stop dead at the doors.

          EXT. SCHOOL STEPS - NIGHT

          A truck's headlights pin them in full view. Ginger rolls her
          sleeve down over her paw. Brigitte swoons as if she might
          black out on the spot.
          The truck's engine cuts and the doors slowly open.

          JASON
          Well, well well..

          

          

          

          
          GINGER SNAPS -WALTON/Jufy 15, 1996 76
          Jason and his pals climb out of the van. They hold beer
          bottles: they have come here to drink.

          JASON
          The fair sisters Fitzgerald.

          GINGER
          Hey. How's it goin'?

          JASON
          You tell me.
          Tim cracks the door and takes a look inside.

          TIM
          Holy shit - they trashed the
          place!
          The guys gawk: they are very impressed.

          BOYS

          JASON

          Brigitte glares at Ginger.

          GINGER
          You won't tell.

          JASON
          Oh I might.

          GINGER
          No you won't.

          GINGER
          You keep our lil' secret and I

          Brigitte slumps against the wall.

          JASON

          TIM

          JASON
          Jason gets the eager nod from his gang.

          JASON
          Okay, let's go.

          GINGER
          Not now - I'm a mess. We're

          she goes)

          then.

          JASON

          GINGER
          I won't ditch. But you guys say
          a word about this to any one, -
          and there's no action. So it's
          up to you. You stay quiet, you
          score. You don't - phhtt - nice

          JASON
          Deal.
          He extends his hand to shake on it. Linger shakes it
          awkwardly with her good hand. Brigitte thumps her head
          against the wall.

          INT. GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Ginger leans on the bathroom door, which is shut.

          GINGER
          C'mon Bee...

          INT. GIRLS' BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Brigitte is sitting on the closed seat of the toilet trying
          to pull her hair out.

          BRIGITTE
          Shut up, leave me alone!

          GINGER (O/S)
          It's not that big a deal.

          BRIGITTE (O/S)
          How can you say that! Two people
          are dead because of you. Us.

          GINGER
          They pissed me off.
          Brigitte opens the bathroom door.

          BRIGITTE
          Oh. Then they we asking for it?
          What about Jason an' them? Gonna
          kill 'em all when yer done,
          Ginger? 'Cause you have to take
          yer clothes OFF for that shit,
          they wanna SEE yer BODY for that
          shit, you gonna let like five
          guys live to tell how they
          fucked the Beast a' Bailey
          Downs? That could annoy you too!
          Ginger prods a claw into Brigitte's chest, pinning her in
          place.

          GINGER
          Think yer sooo smart? I think
          yer sooo jealous.

          BRIGITTE
          Yeah, I'm jealous yer turning
          into a nympho. I'm so jealous
          yer killing people who did never
          did nothing to you. Yeah Ginger.
          Sure.

          GINGER
          Oh, wow.

          

          

          

          

           79
          Brigitte takes a deep breath, swallows hard.

          BR IG ITTE
          I don't wanna do this any more.
          Ginger's claw pricks Brigitte's skin. Brigitte cringes.
          Blood appears around the claw.

          GINGER
          What.

          BRIGITTE
          I'm sorry, but...!
          Brigitte writhes in pain as Ginger's claw slices in deeper.

          BRIGITTE
          Ginger?! This is me.
          Ginger retracts the claw, and Brigitte grabs the wound.

          GINGER

          SO?
          Ginger hurls Brigitte against the wall. Ginger throws herself
          on top of Brigitte. Ginger raises her killing claw to
          Bri g.iLt.e' s neck.

          GINGER
          Who needs you?
          Brigitte is helpless and looks terrified. Ginger's face is
          contorted with intensity, with madness. Ginger's drooling. A
          drip of gob drops onto Brigitte's face.

          BRIGITTE
          (very small,

          PLAINTIVE)
          Ginger...
          Ginger lifts Brigitte by the shirt-front and searches her
          eyes. Ginger drops Brigitte to the floor and grabs her coat.
          Brigitte grabs Ginger's leg.

          BRIGITTE
          Don't, please!
          Brigitte struggles to hang on, to rise from the floor;
          Ginger's really hurt her.

          BRIGITTE
          Maybe we can stop it! Lemme try!
          Ginger kicks free.

          

          

          

          

           80

          GINGER
          An' spoil my fun? I'll skin you
          alive first.
          Brigitte struggles to a point between Ginger and the window.

          BR IG ITTE
          You're fucked without me.
          They'll catch you. Wake up!

          GINGER
          No, you wake up! Nobody'll live
          to catch me. Yer a two-faced
          lil' chicken shit? Your problem,
          Brigitte. I don't need ya. I
          don't WANTCHA! So stay away from
          me or I'll kill you I swear I'll
          have you for breakfast.
          Brigitte backs out of Ginger's way.
          Ginger steps up i.o the window and climbs through.
          Brigitte rubs her throat, trying hard to keep breathing.
          Brigitte dashes to her own bed and drags an Adidas gym bag
          from under it. Brigitte starts grabbing clothes off the
          floor and jamming them into the bag.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          I was like, okay. Fuck you too.
          She'd be sorry. And I'd be like,
          I dunno - somewheres' totally
          else goin' not my problem.
          Right.

          EXT SERVICE LANE - NIGHT
          Brigitte trudges up to the bus stop next to the fence of the
          playhouse yard with her full Adidas bag.
          Light streams from inside the yard, multi-coloured, strobing.
          It looks like a UFO has landed on the other side of the
          fence.
          She peers through the slats. She sees the playhouse, lit up
          like a Christmas tree. She sees gloved hands and police
          uniforms. Then sliding past, the long - almost endless -
          shape on a stretcher being drawn out of the playhouse:
          they've found Trina's body.
          The bus appears, approaching from way down the road.

          

          

          

          

           81
          Brigitte looks from it to the crime scene. The crime scene
          photographer's FLASH! pops in Brigitte's face - blinding her
          for a second. Brigitte rubs her eyes. She shakes her head
          hard.
          The bus is indicating, slowing to pull over.
          Brigitte opens her eyes. The bus is almost here. Brigitte
          grips her Adidas bag.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          But you can't break up with
          blood. You can't divorce yer
          sister. You jus' can't.
          The bus passes, obscuring Brigitte from view as its body
          fills frame. when its tail lights pass, Brigitte is far down
          the street, running like a champion in the direction she came
          from.

          INT. GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Brigitte carefully unlocks the bedroom door and slowly opens
          it. The room is dark and just as she left it. Ginger's hed
          has not been slept in, and she is no where to be seen.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          I'd get the monkshood from my
          locker at school the next
          morning.
          Brigitte creeps to the bathroom and snaps the light on.
          Empty.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          I'd find Ginger, I'd find out if
          the stuff even worked.
          Brigitte locks the window shut. She locks the bedroom door
          and pushes a bureau of drawers in front of it.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          I could deal with whatever, as
          long as I tried. If it was the
          last thing she ever saw me do,
          it was gonna be me goin' fer
          somethin' by myself. The real
          Ginger woulda dug that large.
          Brigitte turns on the bedside lamp and fishes a baseball bat
          out of the closet.

          

          

          

          

           82

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          I would try to save my sister
          when the sun came up. You know,
          if the sun came up.
          Brigitte climbs into bed, snuggling the bat in with her. She
          lights a smoke. She finds the feminine hygiene calendar on
          the bedside table next to the photo of the girls as kids at
          Halloween, taken many years before.
          The calendar tells us it is about to be Friday. Friday is the
          full moon. Friday is Halloween.

          INT GIRLS' ROOM - DAWN
          The lamp is still on. The ash tray is full of butts. Brigitte
          stirs in her sleep.
          Ginger stands at the end of Brigitte's bed, staring at her.
          Brigitte snaps to, gripping the bat. Ginger snorts, and
          climbs into her own bed.
          Brigitte swings her gaze to the window. It is still shut and
          locked. The bureau is still in front of the door. Brigitte
          holds her hat tightly and watches her sister's back in the
          next bed, terrified.

          EXT. BAILEY HIGH - DAY

          Brigitte jogs up to the school. The yard is full of
          students. Teachers are marshaling them into lines and seating
          them on the grass. Brigitte plows through.
          Ginger rides past, piggy-backed by Jason. Ginger completely
          ignores Brigitte. Brigitte looks very worried.

          FEMALE STUDENTS
          Ginger Fitzgerald is such a
          slut./No kidding./The bitch.

          VARIOUS STUDENTS
          You hear about Trina
          Sinclair?/Dug her up in
          somebody's back yard!/oh that's
          so sad!/ Poor Trina, Ga-awd!
          As Brigitte gets closer to the building, she finds police
          cars and cops at the main entrance.

          

          

          

          

           83

          BRIGITTE
          Shit.
          PRINCIPAL FARDOR is speaking with the RCMP constable who has
          been visiting classes. Fardor holds a hanky over his face.

          FARDOR
          That stench near the staff
          offices, what is that you think?
          Brigitte hedges up the steps toward the door.

          OFFICER
          I couldn't say, sir. Now is
          there anyone you suggest we talk
          to? Anyone with something
          against the school?
          Brigitte slips past the two men.

          FARDOR
          For god's sake look around you.
          I got 350 angry young people
          bored blind.Helluva day for my
           goddamn cleaning staff to be
          late ... . IIEY!
          Brigitte stops at the threshold.

          FARDOR
          The hell you goin'?

          BR IG ITTE
          I left something in my locker.

          FARDOR
          Find your homeroom and wait.
          School's outta bounds until we
          call you in. Get!
          Brigitte backs down the steps, looking like she just took a
          good slap. She turns to confront the mass confusion around
          her.
          Brigitte spots Ginger dancing on the roof of a car in the lot
          now, surrounded by boys. Brigitte spots Sam's truck near-by.

          EXT. BAILEY HIGH PARKING LOT - DAY

          Sam is sit in his truck, slumped over the wheel. He holds an
          almost-gone bottle of rye. Brigitte runs up.

          

          

          

          

           84
          Sam is crying. He doesn't see Brigitte arrive at his window,
          so she turns to tip-toe away. Sam looks up. His eyes tell us
          he's stoned.

          SAM
          Hey. Wolfs bane. Wanna drink?
          Brigitte stops and turns to face him. Sam dries his face on
          his sleeve and pops his passenger door. Brigitte looks around
          and slides in.
          Ginger is watching Brigitte out of the corner of her eye.

          INT. SAM'S TRUCK - DAY


          SAM
          I showed up to see Trina? But
          she's I'm goin' strange in
          the head.
          Brigitte doesn't know what to say, so she offers his a smoke.
          He takes it.

          SAM
          Why? Why would ya do a thing
          like that?
          Brigitte examine his. face for an implication. There isn't
          one.

          SAM
          What's unny is I dumped her
          that night. Feel bad about it
          now. Truth is, she was a pain in
          the ass. I sound like a jerk,
          right.

          BR IGITTE
          No.

          SAM
          Really? Yeah well, while she
          was - disappearin', I'm off have
          a time at the Highway Home with
          my buddy Georgio. Drinkin',
          dealin' - an, now she's
          Sam is over-come again. Brigitte raises a hand to touch him,
          chickens out, and then scores on the second attempt. He
          rolls right into her arms.

          

          

          

          

           85
          For a brief moment, Brigitte has her nose in his hair, her
          cheek on his shoulder, her hands on his back. He's crying,
          and she fights her own tears.

          SAM
          Sorry, this is strange. I don't
          even ...Last time I saw her she
          was so mad at me. An' we did
          have some times, we did. Makes
          me sick what her last thought a'
          me musta been though.
          Their eyes meet, their faces are inches apart. Brigitte
          kisses him, very softly and very quickly and then pulls out.
          Sam looks shocked. Brigitte looks more shocked.

          EXT. BAILEY HIGH PARKING LOT - MEANWHILE/DAY

          Ginger stops dancing a second. She is staring at Brigitte
          and Sam in his truck. Her face darkens.

          INT. SAM'S TRUCK - DAY


          BRIGITTE
          I'm really, um.
          Sam leans in and kisses her right back. Better. Longer.

          SAM
          Shit. Sorry. Kinda freaked. You
          know? I shouldn't, well.

          BRIGITTE
          Yeah. Yeah.

          SAM
          But that was really nice.

          BRIGITTE
          Oh. 'Kay. Good.
          They sit staring straight ahead a moment. A cop ahead double-
          takes them, and reaches into his car for the radio mic.

          SAM
          You wanna lil' dube or
          somethin'? Listenin' to me go
          on like a loser-What's yet-

          Yes! Dirty thoughts! oh. I been
          drinkin'. Should not drive.
          Right, Brr-igitte?
          Brigitte drags her hands over her face with extreme anxiety.

          Oh, right. OK. Ur.

          SAM
          Ginger's yer sister right?
          Sam grimaces as Brigitte nods.

          Why?

          SAM
          Oh, rumors - say she's doin'

          ho', that kinder thing. Hey.
          Don't worry about it. Nobody
          mentioned you.
          Ginger's most maniacal laugh drifts over to them. Brigitte
          sees her dancing sexily on the roof of a car with a whole
          crowd of leering boys.

          sh-sure. Sorry. I gotta -
          Ginger, so.
          Brigitte slips out of the truck as they stare at one another
          with that look you get when you're scared because you just
          kissed someone you really, really like.

          EXT. BAILEY HIGH PARKING LOT - DAY

          Two more squad cars are gliding up the street toward the
          school.
          .Brigitte makes her way toward Ginger.

          fie was jus' drunk, I'm thinkin'.
          I mean he prob'ly din't mean it.
          Whatever.
          Beyond Sam's truck, behind Brigitte, the two new cruisers
          lurch to a stop. Cops approach Sam's vehicle with extreme
          caution.
          Brigitte arrives at the car with Ginger as,

          GINGER
          All a' you guys?! My house!
          Tonight!
          (very sinister)

          ALL RIGHT, GINGER:::! WHO00-

          HOO!
          The crowd applauds. Brigitte stares at Ginger like she's
          watching a cruise missile coming in. Ginger notices Brigitte
          watching her. Ginger pretends she doesn't see her.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          Ginger was gonna kill every one
          of l em.
          A commotion behind them causes everyone to turn.
          Sam is being dragged from his truck by the cops. He is flung
          face-first onto the hood and hand-cuffed.

          COP
          Sam McDonald? You're under
          arrest for the murder of Trina
          Sinclair.
          Brigitte physically fights with herself not to yell out. She
          runs a few steps toward Sam. Brigitte looks back at Ginger,
          who drills her with an evil warning glare.
          The cops shove Sam into the back of a cruiser. They roar
          off.
          Brigitte stands alone, apart from the crowd. The cruisers'
          flashing lights disappear down the street. Brigitte turns to
          face Ginger, mustering her own first menacing look.
          Ginger accepts a cigarette offered by one of her boys.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          They closed the school that day.
          So I never got to my locker. So
          I never got the monkshood. I

          Ginger eats like a fiend, with sunglasses on. Her monster arm
          has been wrapped in gauze from tip to elbow.

          PAMELA
          Now just remember, no boys in
          you bedroom during this party.
          Your room is off limits. Ginger
          are you sure that arm's not
          sprained, or worse?

          GINGER
          Bruise. Lacrosse.

          PAMELA
          Mm Henry when'd you get this new
          meat from Tinny's? Quite nice.
          Brigitte and Ginger exchange a look.

          HENRY
          I haven't been to Tinny's.

          PAMELA
          Then where's all the packs
          marked "t" come from -?
          Brigitte spits out her food.

          BRIGITTE
          I be excused?

          INT. FITZGERALD MINIVAN - MAGIC HOUR

          Brigitte is using the vehicle's portable phone as she eyes
          the silhouettes of the family -still at the dining table - in
          the window above her.
          She stares at her watch during the following,

          911 OPERATOR (O/S)
          911, do you need fire, ambulance
          or police, please.

          BRIGITTE
          (speaking very

          QUICKLY)
          Sam McDonald is not the Beast of
          Bailey Downs. He was at the
          Highway Home Motel when Trina
          Sinclair was killed. Sam didn't
          do it.

          

          

          

          

           90
          Brigitte whips the phone shut, hanging up. She breathes out
          long and slow.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          In case this was the last thing
          I'd do. I wanned Sam out of it.
          Sam shouldn't suffer.

          INT. FITZGERALD DINING ROOM - LATER

          Brigitte hovers in the door way. Henry is reading the paper.

          HENRY
          That Sinclair girl was found at
          the Bernstein's, can you believe
          it?

          PAMELA
          What, last night? I didn't hear
          a thing! Never going to have
          these done in time. Henry help.
          Pamela is feverishly creating little straw witches and such
          party decorations. She has a se]ecl.i.on of dried flowers,
          wheat etc on the table before her.

          PAMELA
          Brigitte, honey we're
          thrilled you two are making
          friends. But next time you two
          do something like this give
          Mummy a little more notice, will
          you? Hate having to scramble.
          Brigitte slides into her regular chair and props her hands on
          her wrists in an attitude of complete distraction.

          HENRY
          What's your sister up to?
          Brigitte looks at Henry as he works on a little witch.

          PAMELA
          She said she had a lot of work
          to do on her costume. Should we
          dress up, you think?
          Henry grimaces. He sifts through the dried plants before
          them. Brigitte double-takes the pile.

          PAME-LA
          oh, Henry. You're no fun at all.

          

          

          

          

           91
          Brigitte sits bolt up right in her seat.

          BRIGITTE
          What is this stuff?

          PAMELA
          Just weeds, old cuttings from
          the yard.

          BRIGITTE
          No, THIS stuff.
          Brigitte plucks out a handful of dried plant with tiny purple
          flowers.

          PAMELA
          Oh, I had that around the
          dahlias. Man at the greenhouse
          said it'd keep the cats out.
          Seemed to do the job. It's got a
          funny name - nun's robe, priest
          hat, something

          BRIGITTE
          Monkshood.

          PAMELA
          That's right. Do we have a
          budding botanist in the family?!

          HENRY
          Pun intended.
          Pamela giggles as does Henry. Brigitte grabs a fistful of
          monkshood and races for the door.

          PAMELA
          Hey, we need that! Brigitte!
          But Brigitte is gone.

          PAMELA
          That was my accent colour!

          INT. BASEMENT PROPER - DUSK

          The half-finished basement has a rec room which Pamela has
          decked out in an infantile version of ghoulish for the party.
          Punch sits ready next to case-lot pop and Tupperware brimming
          with snacks.

          

          

          

          
          GINGER SNAPS - WALTON/July 15. 1996 92
          Brigitte walks through to the door with a sign, OFF LIMITS.
          Brigitte unlocks the door and slips the monkshood up her
          shirt.

          INT. BEDROOM - DUSK

          Candles are burning all over. Ginger's bed is turned down,
          ready. Brigitte walks in on Jason climbing through the open
          window.

          JASON
          Hey. Must be the place, right?
          Brigitte sneers at him. He holds a half-gone bottle of
          schnapps, a dress shirt and his Good Jeans on.
          The toilet flushes in the john. Brigitte knocks on the door.

          GINGER

          WHAT1

          BRIGITTE
          McCardy's here.
          The bathroom door unlocks but. remains closed.

          GINGER
          Git in here an, gimme a hand.
          Brigitte casts an uncertain look at Jason.

          JASON
          C'mon ladies, there's six other
          guys sitting in the shrub
          waiting.
          Brigitte's face darkens. She slips into the bathroom and
          shuts the door.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          Do you think some people deserve
          to die?

          INT. GIRLS BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Brigitte does not tryo to hide her fear of being in a
          confined space with Ginger. There are razors and whiskers all
          over the floor. shaving cream every where. Ginger is red-
          faced, sweating and hostile.

          

          

          

          

           

          93

          GINGER
          Don't say a fuckin' word.
          Ginger lowers the towel she's wearing enough to show the
          bump on her butt is now a twitching tail. Brigitte gasps.

          GINGER
          Take this gauze and tie it flat.

          BRIGITTE
          Ginger, you can't

          GINGER

          DO IT!
          Brigitte takes the roll of gauze. She grabs the tail between
          her fingers and coils it up with utter disgust. Brigitte's
          hands tremble.

          EXT. GIRLS BEDROOM - MEANWHILE/NIGHT

          Jason sits on the edge of Ginger's bed and bounces up and
          down a bit. Between his legs we glimpse a dog tag hanging
          between the mattresses.

          TNT GIRLS BATHROOM - NIGHT
          Brigitte tapes the gauze in place. Ginger throws a robe on
          and grabs the door.

          GINGER
          Now get outta my life.
          Brigitte grits her teeth.

          BRIGITTE
          I gotta get ready for the party.

          GINGER
          Then wait here till I'm done.

          BRIGITTE
          What, through all fifty a' them?

          GINGER
          Oh, don't tempt me.
          Ginger takes a deep breath before she opens the bathroom
          door. Her breath is ragged. She smoothes her hair and chews
          her lip. She's nervous. Ginger opens the door and closes it
          behind her.

          

          

          

          
          GINGER SNAPS- WALTON/July 22, 1996 94
          Brigitte hears,

          JASON (O/S)
          It's really dark in here.

          GINGER (01S)
          I'm shy. Lay down.
          Brigitte puts the toilet seat down and sits on it. Brigitte
          lights a smoke. Brigitte withdraws the monkshood from under
          her shirt and has a good scratch where it was itching her.
          OFF-SCREEN are the sounds of slurp kisses and Jason's moans.
          A fly unzips. Clothes fall with soft plunks to the floor.
          Bed springs creak. Plastic condom wrappers crinkle and then
          the SNAP-WHAP of one being fitted on pretty roughly.
          Somewhere above them the door bell starts ringing.
          From a vanity cupboard she pulls a Zombie face-painting kit
          and sets it next to the monkshood.

          EXT. FITZGERALD BUNGALOW -- NIGHT

          Cars are streaming down the street in both directions.
          Groups of COSTUMED TEENAGE BOYS flock down the walks, over
          lawns, and que up to get into the Fitzgerald party.
          On their front porch, Pamela and Henry meet and greet the
          young men, awed by their numbers.

          HENRY
          (to Pamela)
          Notice any girls?
          Pamela shrugs.

          INT. GIRLS' BATHROOM - MEANWHILE/NIGHT

          Brigitte - now in ZOMBIE-face - rubs the monkshood between
          her fingers, crumbling it into a neat pile on the counter.
          OFF-SCREEN from the bedroom, the sounds of Ginger having
          rough sex continue.
          Brigitte peels a centimeter of paper off the end of an unlit
          smoke and wiggles the cigarette, creating a second pile of
          tobacco. She reaches into the radiator vent and withdraws a
          package of rolling papers.

          EXT. FITZGERALD BUNGALOW'S REAR - MEANWHILE;/NIGHT


          

          

          

          
          GINGER SNAPS - WALTON/July 15. 1996 95
          One BOY in a skeleton costume creeps along the shrubs toward
          the Fitzgerald sisters' bedroom window. He stumbles over a
          demon, a Frankenstein and a mummy. They curse one another.

          INT. GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

          OFF-SCREEN, from the rec room part noise grows as things get
          under way outside.
          Ginger waves good-bye to Jason as she undoes Frank's shirt
          buttons. The bathroom door is now inching open a crack.

          INT. GIRLS' BATHROOM - NIGHT

          On the counter at the sink, all evidence of Brigitte's
          project with the monkshood are gone.
          Brigitte peers out the cracked door and then looks away,
          fighting an urge to watch in spite of being grossed out. The
          sounds of sex drift in from the bedroom.
          She catches sight of herself in the mirror. As a ZOMBIE. She
          tugs her shirt tight over her breasts. Nothing to see.
          She smoothes her shirt with her hands, then moves her palms
          down over her waist, her hips. Over her crotch. Brigitte's
          fingers skip under her skirt.
          Brigitte's face tells us she's searching for something under
          there. She's trying this out. But nothing's happening.
          She frowns. She draws her hands out of her skirt and quickly
          washes her hands in the sink. She checks her watch and sighs.

          INT. GIRLS BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Brigitte creeps out of the bathroom on all fours. Above her,
          Ginger's feet and some guy's writhe on the bed.
          Brigitte reaches up to the bedroom door knob. She opens it
          and crawls out.

          INT. FITZGERALD BASEMENT PROPER - NIGHT

          The rec room is packed with over-grown ghouls. Pamela is
          trying to play it cool from her perch behind the punch bowl,
          as she marvels at the costumes and all these kids she's never
          even. met before.

          

          

          

          

           96
          Henry has a group of boys cornered with a college football
          story.
          Brigitte leans against the wall watching the party and
          looking at her watch.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          In English I heard about this
          chick who used a man's name to
          get her books read. She went by
          George but she was really Mary
          Ann? Goes, "It's never too late
          to be what you might have been."
          I was jus' there thinkin', is
          that true? Was it too late to be
          an unsolved Mystery? Alls I had
          to do was walk away...

          MALE VOICE (O/S)
          Brigitte F.!
          Brigitte looks up to see a cheap plastic Frankenstein mask
          looking down at her. Its owner flips it up: it's Sam.
          Brigitte's eyes snap wide open in shock.

          SAM
          They let me go. No evidence:
          someone called in this tip.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          So I decided to stay.

          BRIGITTE
          Hey, you gotta get outta here -/
          Ginger emerges from the bedroom like a reigning diva, and the
          room stops dead.
          Brigitte drops her glass of punch.
          Ginger has come out as herself, as an almost full-blown
          werewolf. She wears a Lill Red Riding Hood cape jobbie and a
          plastic mask. She's the best looking monster you ever laid
          eyes on. Down her belly she has six perfect nipples showing
          and everything.
          The room bursts into a_cheerinq round of applause.

          GUS.' WITH 'AX IN THE HEAD'
          That make-up is amazing!

          GUY WITH 'EYE MISSING'
          Ginger, it looks totally real!

          HENRY
          (to Pamela)
          Told you. She's a arts-type,
          for chrissakes, look at that.

          PAMELA
          She's very good, isn't she?

          SAM
          (to Brigitte)
          Wow, yer sister's gone to town.

          BRIGITTE
          Yeah, she's gone all right. Hey.
          can you do me a favor?

          SAM
          Sure.

          BRIGITTE
          Can you give somethin' to Ginger
          for me? Jus' - we're Navin' a
          fight, but I got this thing for
          her.

          SAM
          Yeah, what.
          Brigitte shows him what appears to be a joint. Sam takes it.

          BR IG ITTE
          Don't tell her I gave it to you.
          Jus' act like it's from you. She
          won't take it if it's from me.

          SAM
          Oh, okay.

          BR IG ITTE
          An, don't like, go any wheres
          with her. Okay? Jus' come right
          back, 'kay?

          SAM
          Gonna miss me Bee F.?
          Brigitte smiles, embarrassed and freaking at the exact same
          time.

          SAM
          Be right back.

          

          

          

          
          GINGER SNAPS- WALTON/July 15. 1996 98
          Across the densely crowded room, Sam whispers in Ginger's
          ear. Ginger smiles and nods and palms something he passes
          her.
          Ginger glances at Brigitte, who tries to pretend she's not
          watching. when Brigitte checks again, Ginger is leading Sam
          by the hand toward her bedroom. Sam looks over his shoulder
          and lifts a finger - one second - back at Brigitte.
          The bedroom door shuts behind them. Brigitte leaps toward
          the bedroom. Someone catches her arm and holds her back.

          PAMELA
          one minute young lady, I could
          use a little help here.

          BR I G ITTE
          Let go of me, I have to get
          Ginger!

          PAMELA
          I have to get two more veggie
          trays down those stairs. I
          think your sister' 11 be fine for
          two minutes.
          Pamela is already marching Brigitte up the stairs. Brigitte
          strains to get back. Looking between her mother and her
          closed bedroom door, desperately.

          INT. FITZGERALD BASEMENT PROPER - MINUTES LATER

          Pamela snags Brigitte again as Brigitte dumps the veggie tray
          and tries to get to the bedroom.

          PAMELA
          All these boys came to see you
          two, least you can do is stop
          hiding in your room. Honestly,
          you act like someone'd forced
          this party down your throat.
          Now go be nice.
          Pamela stands between Brigitte and the bedroom door, her arms
          folded.

          BRIGITTE
          Mother. You don't understand.

          PAMELA
          Yes--I do. I was shy too at your
          age. Mingle.

          

          

          

          

           99
          Brigitte backs away with such a dirty look on her face. She
          turns to confront the eager painted faces around her - all
          desperate for some female attention. Brigitte has I want to
          scream written all over her face.

          INT. GIRLS BEDROOM - MEANWHILE/NIGHT

          Sam pushes Ginger away from him. Ginger has Brigitte's gift
          joint smoldering between her finger tips. Ginger is pretty
          out of it, she totters.

          SAM
          okay, cut it out now.

          GINGER
          This dope's fucked. Makin' me
          blaarrggh. C'mon. I'll do ya.

          SAM
          No thanks. Told yer sister I'd
          be right back.

          GINGER
          What's up your ass?!

          SAM
          Don't get mean, s'nothin'
          personal. I happen to think
          Brigitte's pretty cool. and -/

          GINGER
          Leave my baby sister alone. Do
          me, don't hurt her.

          SAM
          I won't hurt her. Now be a good
          girl and finish up your joint.

          GINGER
          oh. Well fuck you.
          Ginger takes a big toke as she paces between Sam and the
          door. Suddenly she's coughing uncontrollably, rubbing her
          eyes, wailing in pain.

          GINGER
          Burning! What is this?!
          Sam makes a move toward her and Ginger blindly lashes out at
          him. Ginger hurls Sam into the bed. Sam's flight path knocks
          the mattress askew: dozens and dozens of dog collars pour
          out over him. Sam fingers one in particular.

          SAM
          Morely -?!

          INT. BASEMENT PROPER - NIGHT

          Brigitte sits on the stairs to the main floor cornered by a
          guy dressed as a cow.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          Something was definitely fucked.
          Brigitte eyes Pamela, who is slowly being distracted by horny
          young men who will now dance with anybody, even Pamela.

          COW GUY
          Do you think this is a faggy
          costume for a guy? You can just
          say. I dunno I been gettin'
          funny looks. What, like we
          aren't advanced enough that a
          guy can show up completely in
          the spirit of the thing with an
          udder, an' not get treated like
          a freakin' fruit?
          Brigitte looks at her watch. Pamela is dragged off into the
          throng by a band of juveniles singing Do The Hustle. Brigitte
          makes her move at last.

          COW GUY
          snob.
          Brigitte makes a badly-faked would-be casual bee-line for
          their bedroom door.
          Brigitte wiggles the knob. It's locked.

          TNT GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT
          Brigitte (still a zombie) unlocks the door and peers in. The
          light is on in the bathroom, the door is ajar. The shower is
          running. There are a few candles burning in corners.
          otherwise the room is dark.
          Brigitte steps inside, closing the door on the party behind
          her. She grabs a flashlight and turns it on.
          The walls are splattered with blood.
          There is gore on the floor. Brigitte plucks the monkshead
          joint from a pool of bloody goo - it is soaked. Useless.

          

          

          

          
          GINGER SNAPS- WALTON/July 22, 1996 101
          On the bed, Sam lays with his shirt off and his fly open.
          His face is mutilated. He's missing an eye.
          Brigitte creeps toward him.
          Sam groans. Brigitte leaps back. she tries to speak, but her
          voice isn't working. Her face transforms from horror to fury.
          Then she heads to bathroom door.

          TNT. ATTACHED BATH - NIGHT

          BRIGITTE
          You bitch!
          Brigitte discovers Ginger sitting in the tub floor under the
          running shower, weeping. Her eyes are swollen. Ginger is now
          covered in coarse hair. The water around her is full of
          blood. There is a kitchen knife next to her. Ginger's stoned
          numb on the monkshood dose. She's groggy and weak.

          BR IG ITTE
          oh fuck !
          Ginger is squeezing her now full tail at its base, where the
          blood is oozing between her f..inger.s. Ginger has tried - and
          tailed - to euL her tail off.

          BRIGITTE
          Oh no. Oh no. Fuck, fuck!
          Ginger doesn't move. Ginger looks so pathetic, it's heart-
          breaking. Brigitte snatches the knife away and shuts off the
          water.

          GINGER
          Nobody'll want me now any ways.
          Sc.
          Brigitte takes in the cut, the rest of the monstrosity her
          sister has become.

          GINGER
          I don't wanna do this any more.
          Brigitte yanks Ginger out of the tub and grabs a towel,
          frantic.

          BRIGITTE
          Press this on the cut! Ginger!
          Move, c'mon!

          

          

          

          
          GINGER SNAPS- WALTON/July 22, 1996 1 02
          Ginger does as she's told. Brigitte digs out gauze and tape
          packages. They're both almost empty - they've used it all up.
          Brigitte throws them on the floor.

          GINGER
          I missed you Bee. I'm sorry.
          Brigitte searches Ginger's face.

          BRIGITTE
          Ginge'? That you in there?
          Ginger cracks an uncertain, pained smile. Brigitte does too,
          an exact replica, in fact.

          GINGER
          Ya feeb.
          Brigitte gently turns Ginger around to try and deal with her
          tail. Ginger is woozy and weak from blood loss.

          BRIGITTE
          okay. I can't clean this one up.
          We have to go. Like Go, go. Can
          you do it?

          GINGER
          I'm so woozy.
          Brigitte glances out into the bedroom.

          BRIGITTE
          Um. Ever bite something you
          din't kill?

          GINGER
          No.
          (misinterpreting the
          question - hopeful)
          Wanna be one with me?

          BRIGITTE
          Ah. No. Sam? Isn't dead.

          GINGER
          Oooh nooo.

          BRIGITTE
          Don't worry. Keep pressing.
          T'll be right back.

           1 03
          Sam is fingering his wounds, half-conscious, drooling bile
          and blood. Brigitte (still a zombie) looms up behind him
          with her baseball bat. She fishes in his pants' pocket and
          withdraws a set of keys.

          BRIGITTE
          Hey. Sorry. I really did think
          you were. Like. Not bad. So you
          know, whatever. Any ways. I'm
          really sorry - I have to.
          Sam moans as his good eye rolls up at her. Brigitte blinks
          away tears and looks away, collecting herself.
          Brigitte raises the bat over her head and swings it down as

          INT. FITZGERALD BASEMENT PROPER - MINUTES LATER

          The party is rocking along. Pamela knocks on their door.

          PAMELA
          Girls? You in there? You're
          not being very sociable...
          There's no answer. She tries the knob, and is surprised to
          find it unlocked. She opens the door. She turns on the
          lights.
          Pamela takes in the bloody muck everywhere. The room is
          deserted. No Sam. No sisters Fitzgerald. Just gore.
          Pamela swoons and drops like a deadweight to the floor.
          Henry rushes up, looking in over his wife's body. The boys in
          costume crowd in behind him.

          HENRY
          Pamela, honey, it's just a
          prank, you know how they...
          (he fingers some

          GORE)
          Holy mother of - it's warm.
          Where are my kids?!!

          GUY WITH AX IN THE HEAD
          Ginger went in here with Sam
          McDonald a while back.

          HENRY
          Sam McDonald?

          

          

          

          

           104

          GUY WITH EYE MISSING
          Yeah, you know. The guy they
          thought was the Beast, but they
          let 'im go.
          Henry steps into the room. He spots a bloody trail up to the
          open ground-level window.

          EXT FITZGERALD HOME - NIGHT
          Tires squeal in the street and the county regreening truck
          lurches out of its parking spot.

          INT. TRUCK - NIGHT

          Brigitte (still a zombie) throws the truck into gear with an
          amateur's hand. Her Adidas bag and her jar of two dollar
          bills is on the seat next to her.
          Ginger is just seen through the grate between the cab and the
          dark back of the truck.

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          Plans, plans arc good. 'Course I
          hardly had one. Adrenaline
          though, adrenaline is pretty
          speedy shit.

          BRIGITTE
          Ginger?! Don't eat the body
          okay? I got this idea, an'
          we'll need Sam.
          Brigitte floors it and the truck blasts down their cul du sac
          to the main road.

          EXT. STREETS/TRAVELING - NIGHT

          The truck speeds down the street a tad erratical ly. Sirens
          rise around it.

          INT. THE TRUCK - NIGHT

          Brigitte slows, looking left, right and in the side mirrors
          trying to see where the sirens are coming from.

          BRIGITTE
          Fuck, fuck fuck, FUCK.

          

          

          

          

           105
          Then suddenly, four cop cars blast past them in the opposite
          direction. Heading back to the Fitzgerald house.

          BRIGITTE
          Ha! All rightie then.
          Brigitte drives on.
          What she cannot see behind her in the grate are the glimpses
          of Ginger in the flickering lights of the passing street
          lamps. Her final spurt of transformation is taking place:
          FLASH! Her face is filling in with fur.
          FLASH! Her eyes glow golden, yellow, wolfen.
          FLASH! Her face pulls into a wet snout.
          FLASH! A long pink tongue lolls out between glistening white
          fangs.

          EXT. THE HILLCREST - NIGHT

          The truck rolls to the crest of the hill over Bailey Downs -
          the sight of the bush party. The moon is immense up here.
          You could almost touch it.

          INT. THE TRUCK - NIGHT

          Brigitte eases the truck to the edge of the hill. The lights
          of the homes below them creep into view.

          BRIGITTE
          okay, Ginger? They'll think that
          Sam took us from our room,
          right? 'Cause of his record an,
          the arrest, right? We're gonna
          make this look like he did, any
          ways. He got us, maybe killed
          us, took our bodies to do some
          unspeakable thingy. But then?
          Sam killed himself. You follow?
          Ginger doesn't answer.

          

          

          

          

           106

          BRIGITTE
          So boom, diversion. Meanwhile
          you an, me hit the highway. we
          can hitch, get you cleaned up.
          By the time the find out we
          weren't in Sam's clutches at
          all, we could be any wheres.
          Yeah? Whatcha think?
          Ginger doesn't answer.

          BRIGITTE
          It'll work. (I hope.)
          Brigitte puts the brake on but does not cut the engine.

          EXT. THE TRUCK/HILLCREST - NIGHT

          Brigitte climbs out of the cab. She moves to the back doors
          of the truck, and opens them. In the inky darkness inside,
          she hears heavy panting.

          BRIGITTE
          Ginger? C'mon, we got move.
          Shove Sam down here.
          Brigitte climbs up into the truck, reaching for something on
          its floor. Brigitte f itids Sam's prone feet.
          An animal/Ginger launches out at her, knocking her back, out,
          clear of the truck. Ginger isn't Ginger any more - what we
          can glimpse in the darkness is an attack by a creature much
          like the one that bit Ginger. And it's attacking Brigitte.
          Brigitte flails, kicks and punches at it. She breaks free
          and clambers at the tool rack on the inside panel of the
          truck. She grabs a shovel as the creature comes snarling up
          at her.

          BRIGITTE
          Stop. I mean it.
          It lunges at her again and Brigitte clocks it. It slides,
          dazed, off the back of the truck to the ground.

          JUMP TO:
          Brigitte drags Sam's body into the front seat. She sets her
          Adidas bag on the gas pedal. She releases the brake.
          The truck rolls forward. off the top of the hill. Brigitte
          watches as it crashes down, down, rolling and twisting into
          the suburb below. It lands in a heap and bursts into flames.

          

          

          

          

           107

          BRIGITTE
          Nice one.
          Brigitte returns to where It/Ginger was last seen on the
          ground. The shovel and blanket are there. A bloody pool
          trails off into the woods. Brigitte hefts the shovel warily,
          shoulders the blanket, and follows the wetness shining in the
          moonlight.

          INT. TREES/HILLCREST - NIGHT


          BRIGITTE
          Fuck Ginger. Leave a fuckin'
          trail much? Could leave
          everybody a fuckin' map...
          Tense seconds pass as she searches through the scrub and
          trees, shovel ready. we can hear panting and growling.

          BRIGITTE
          I won't hurt you if you don't
          hurt me. 'Kay? Ginge'? 'Kay?
          Brigitte spots something ahead and lowers the shovel as she
          approaches it.
          It/Ginger cowers in the brush, collapsed. Her head and tail
          are bleeding. Brigitte drops to her knees nest to her
          sister, frantic with grief.

          BRIGITTE
          Oh no. Ginger. I didn't mean

          TO
          It/Ginger is gasping, fading. Her eyes start rolling back in
          her head. Brigitte's hand is shaking as it reaches out but
          can't touch her. Ginger licks Brigitte's fingers, slowly.
          Brigitte buries her face in Ginger's ruff, moaning.

          BRIGITTE
          You can't, you can't, we're out.
          You can't, don't don't do this
          to me. Not now. Look, look it's
          all taken care of. we're
          Unsolved Mysteries!

          EXT. A HIGHWAY - PRE-DAWN

          The sunrise has the sky this bloody red.

          

          

          

          

           108
          Brigitte drags Ginger a few feet past a sign next to the
          road: THANK YOU FOR VISITING BAILEY DOWNS!

          BRIGITTE (V/O)
          We made it out. There was this
          road? An' the space between
          here and where ever. I did it.
          Brigitte opens the blanket. Ginger has returned to human
          form. Because Ginger is dead.

          EXT. A HIGHWAY - EARLY MORNING

          In a small grove of trees, Brigitte pushes the last pile of
          dirt over Ginger's shallow grave.
          Brigitte wipes her caked hands off in the dewy grass. Beneath
          the dirt and dried blood, she finds puncture wounds. BITES.
          Brigitte looks TO CAMERA. She rolls her eyes wearily.
          Brigitte stands and heads to the side of the road. A semi
          appears on the horizon, coming her way. Brigitte lifts her
          thumb.
          The semi's turn indicator comes on as it slows and veers to
          arrive before her.
          ROLL TAIL CREDITS as:
          Excerpts from an episode of the television program UNSOLVED
          MYSTERIES roll. It tells the story of the mysterious
          disappearance of two teenage girls - sisters - who
          disappeared under strange circumstances in the normally quiet
          suburb of Bailey Downs.
          Brigitte and Ginger LOOK-A-LIKES re-enact the summarized
          events of their flight from justice. The cops figured out
          their faked deaths, of course.. Henry and Pamela have
          reportedly denied comment. It is seen from the community's
          perspective as two delusional young women gone totally wrong,
          a grotesque tragedy of youth wasted by mental illness. No one
          can explain though the non-human blood trails leaving the
          scene of their last crime...
          At the segment's close and the credits roll. out, we see the
          traditional high school photos of Brigitte and Ginger.
