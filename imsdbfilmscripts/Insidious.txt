          The universe is deathless;
          Is deathless because, having no finite self,
          it stays infinite.
          A sound man by not advancing himself stays the further ahead
          of himself,
          By not confining himself to himself,
          sustains himself outside himself.

          INT. DARKENED BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          A spherical black monolith rises up from a white surface...
          white like the moon.
                         
          In the darkness, the towers metal skin is barely visible.
                         
          We ROTATE AROUND, revealing the tower to actually be a LAMP --
          not rising up from a surface, but hanging down from a white
          ceiling. The bulb unlit.
                         
          Directly below the lamp is the very definition of innocence -
          a sleeping child. Chest rising and falling with each breath.
                         
          We HOVER over the young boy...watching him. A blanket
          emblazoned with dinosaurs is draped across his limbs. His
          mouth is slack, eyelids twitching to dreams unseen.
                         
          The truly deep sleep that an adult can only wish for.
                         
          We move away from him, exploring the dark room. Strewn with
          toys. The door is slightly ajar. We float through it into--

          the boys rhythmic breathing, even quieter.
                         
          A window at the end of the hall enlarges as we approach.
                         
          Someone is standing in front of it.
                         
          The murky silhouette of the figure turns and walks away. We
          follow it, tentative. Turning a corner, we see the figure.
          Standing in a doorway.
                         
          Now we can make out the edges of the person. It is an old
          woman. Hair in a Victorian bun. A corseted dress.

          A woman blinks awake, gazing around the room. Another
          bedroom. Sparse. Just a bed and a cabinet. It is 5.43 AM.
                         
          Her eyes settle on the man lying next to her in the dark. His
          heaving snores have woken her up.
                         
          She is RENAI (pronounced Renee) LAMBERT (36). With a quiet
          determination she is holding on to her youthful good looks,
          but the lines of age are creeping in.
                         
          She has settled into the `comfort' years of a marriage: hair
          pinned up messily, wearing dowdy pajamas.
                         
          She beholds her husband, taking him in. Considering him. He
          snorts and smacks his lips. Very unflattering.
                         
          She climbs out of bed.

          Renai treads across wooden floorboards into a sunken living
          room. No matter careful she is, there is a loud creak with
          each step. A GRANDFATHER CLOCK in the corner ticks steadily.
                         
          There is barely any furniture in here, only a BOOKCASE and a
          PIANO. What there is a lot of...is boxes. Large moving boxes.
                         
          Renai plops cross-legged onto the floor and rips open one of
          the boxes, marked BOOKS. She plucks out a handful of books
          and lines them up on the bookshelf. Then another handful.
                         
          They are all self-help and self-improvement books. Titles
          like `Be The Better You' and `Inch By Inch, It's A Cinch: A
          Guide To Achieving Your Goals' pop out.
                         
          She spots a sealed box labelled PHOTO ALBUMS. She strips away
          the tape and wrestles out a dusty album of wedding photos.
                         
          Smiling faces greet her as she thumbs through the pages. The
          happy couple. Young. Glowing. Sadness washes over her.

          Renai deflates, her shoulders sagging in defeat. She closes
          her notebook and leaves the room.

          Renai scoops up Cali, rocking her gently.
                         
          A scratching sound interrupts. Rough. Frantic. Like a dog
          pawing at something.

          Renai steps into the hall, curious. She can still hear it.
          She follows the sound to a door. Grabs the door handle.
                         
          The sound abruptly ceases.

          stairs that descend into a gloomy basement.
                         
          Renai stands at the top of the stairs, squinting into the
          inky blackness, straining to see.
                         
          She reaches up and yanks a light chain, illuminating a bare
          bulb and throwing light across the tenebrous space.

          Renai takes a step down. She is still carrying Cali.
                         
          FURTHER DOWN below her, we see that there is one step that is
          cracked and broken.
                         
          She takes another step. The broken step is right below her now.
                         
          One more step and she will fall.
                         
          Cali squeals happily. Renai pauses...then turns around,
          heading back up the stairs. Stops when she sees something.
                         
          DEEP, VIOLENT SCRATCH MARKS...running downwards on the inside
          of the door...as if someone were trying to claw their way out.

          He takes a step down the stairs. Then another step.

          the way to the bottom. His light sabre SHATTERS.
                         
          He hits the ground, his head smacking the floor.

          regret sleeping on this couch.
                         
                         
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Renai tosses and turns, restless in sleep.
                         
          Her eyes open and she sucks in a breath. Bad dreams.
                         
          She blinks and looks around the room, surprised to be alone,
          sitting up in fright. Until she remembers why. She eases back
          onto the bed. Then she looks over at the window.
                         
          There is a man standing outside it.
                         
          He is not looking in at her...he is pacing back and forth,
          furiously smoking a cigarette. Back and forth, back and
          forth. Agitated. He has long, black, greasy hair and a grey
          jacket.
                         
          Every muscle in Renai's body freezes. She becomes a glacier.
                         
          Her eyes are drilled to the man, unable to move. By sheer
          will, she manages to direct them towards the bedroom door.
          Opens her mouth but no words will come. Finally--
                         
                          RENAI
           Jo....osh....Josh....Josh...
                         
          She glances back at the window.
                         
          THE MAN IS NOW IN THE ROOM.
                         
          He paces back and forth between the bed and the window, just
          as he was outside, ignoring Renai. Smoking like a fiend.
                         
          And then, suddenly, he stops pacing. Looks up. Straight at
          Renai - as if just realizing she was there.
           38.
                         
                         
          For a moment their eyes are locked in silence...
                         
          ...and then the man's face contorts in anger and he CHARGES
          towards her, arms outstretched, GROWLING in fury.
                         
                          MAN
           DON'T YOU FUCKING DARE!
                         
          Renai lets out a SHRIEK of terror that could strip paint. A
          cry from the depths of her soul.
                         
          She propels herself backward, falling off the bed and
          scrambling back into the corner.
                         
          Josh CHARGES into the room, flicking on the light--

           What is it? What is it?!
                         
          Renai is incoherent. She cannot stop screaming. Josh grabs
          her by the shoulders.

           to -- there was a man there!!!
                         
          Foster runs into the room, visibly terrified. He sees his
          mother and instantly begins crying. He runs to his dad,
          holding onto his leg.
                         
          In the background, Cali begins crying, her screams
          contributing to an overwhelming din.

           I don't want the man to get me.
                         
          The realization that her child is terrified quiets Renai.
                         
          All is suddenly silent, save for the cries of Cali in the
          background. Josh holds his son tight.

          Renai unpacks boxes. An elderly woman, LORRAINE (65), helps to
          unpack. This is Josh's mother. She has a curt, disapproving
          manner about her that doesn't always make her easy to love.
                         
          She is actually moving more quickly than Renai, who groans as
          if her back were aching as she stoops down to pick up books.

           Nonsense. I'm perfectly capable of
           putting a few things away. I did it
           for Josh his whole life. He never
           was good with tidying up.

          She boosts a photo frame from one of the boxes. It is a
          portrait of Renai, Dalton, Foster and Josh. In happier times.

          Lorraine stops unpacking and fixes Renai with a stare. They've
          never really gotten along before. Adversity has brought about
          a truce.

          The drawing is of a hideous form - crouched in the corner of
          the ceiling, staring down at Dalton below. It is the RED-
          FACED DEMON Lorraine saw earlier.
                         
          His naked body is charcoal black...whilst also strangely

          popcorn...followed by another tack.
                         
          The second tack lands in Josh's lap. Puzzled, he picks it up,
          examining it. He looks up, his eye drawn to the picture on
          the wall.
                         
          With total astonishment, he sees the two remaining tacks
          works themselves free, popping out of the wall.
                         
          The drawing floats down to the ground.
                         
          Josh stoops down, picking it up.
                         
          It is a drawing split into two halves. The left half is a
          self portrait of Dalton, lying in bed, looking down from
          above.
                         
          The right half is a depiction of outer space - squiggly stars
          and bloated planets.
                         
          Dalton has drawn another version of himself on this side,
          flying above the house with another man.
                         
          At the bottom of the first drawing, Dalton has written `Last
          night I watched myself sleep'.
                         
          A tear falls down Josh's face. He begins to cry. Deep and
          painful tears he has long pent up.
                         
          Beneath the second drawing, Dalton has written `Then I flew away.'
           68.

          Josh is sitting at the kitchen table, staring at Dalton's
          drawing. He hasn't slept and looks it. He looks up at her.
                         
                          JOSH

          Tucker sets up two stills camera's around Dalton's room,
          zipping back and forth between the two tripods. Specs opens
          up a kit, taking out his notepad and a pencil.
                         
          A small, circular table has been set up, adjacent to Dalton's
          bed. Elise sits at the table, flanked on either side by Josh
          and Renai.
                         
                          ELISE
           What's most important is that you

           happens, happens.
                         
          Josh and Renai nod grimly, truly out of their depth.

          Tucker finally sets his cameras and takes a seat in the corner,
          holding up a HAND-HELD VIDEO CAMERA.

          She turns to Specs.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           Dim the lights please.
                         
          Tucker reaches up and dims the lights to a very low level.
                         
          Elise closes her eyes, concentrating. She relaxes her head,
          as if meditating, letting it loll on her shoulders.
                         
          One of the cameras on the tripod goes off, bathing the room
          in white light for a split second.
                         
          Elise inhales and exhales deeply, slipping away. Soon, she is
          very still.
                         
          Specs nods to Tucker silently, then produces an odd looking
          device made from GREY CLOTH.
                         
          It almost resembles a gas mask from World War 1, with a cone
          shaped muzzle that fits over the mouth and nose. The snout of
          the facemask is like an elongated elephant trunk, coiling
          outwards and ending in an old listening device, like an early
          version of a microphone.
                         
          Specs slips two hooks over Elise's ears and gently places the
          device over her nose and mouth. He then takes a seat next to
          her, behind Renai, who holds Elise's hand.
                         
          Specs takes out his notepad and fixes a small apparatus
          around his neck that holds a flashlight in place.
           70.
                         
                         
          He flicks it on, then holds the microphone end of Elise's
          facemask up to his ear, a pencil gripped in the other hand.
                         
          Dead silence descends over the group like a blanket.
                         
          Then, we hear something lilt through the old microphone. It
          is Elise's muttered whispers. Specs begins writing.
                         
          Renai opens her eyes to peek at what he is scribbling in
          cursive.

          For what seems like an eternity, all is quiet and still...
                         
          ...until Elise's eyelids flutter.
                         
          Another unintelligible whisper drifts out of the microphone
          at Specs' ear. He writes.

          Elise's head TWITCHES as Specs' writes furiously, trying to

          An agonizing ocean of silence...then this furious scrawl:

          Specs writing begins to SHRED the paper as he writes
          furiously, the scrawl getting out of control. Sweat flies
          from his forehead as he struggles to get it all down.
                         
          Suddenly a PIERCING SCREAM blasts through the microphone and
          he jerks it away from his ear - then looks over at Elise.
                         
          With UTTER DREAD, he sees that she is NO LONGER WEARING THE
          MASK. She has taken it off and is panting heavily.

          Shocked silence follows.

          --TO SEE DALTON SITTING NEXT TO HIM. STARING AT HIM.
                         
          His heart leaps out of his skin and so does Renai's as they
          both turn towards Dalton. Their son.
                         
          Dalton stares at them...not a trace of emotion on his face.
                         
          Then he reaches up and grips his bottom jaw with both hands,
          wrenching it downwards with almighty force and BREAKING HIS
          OWN JAW.
                         
          Renai SCREAMS into the abyss as Dalton BELLOWS at them, spit
          flying from his throat, his tongue hanging down over his
          dislocated jaw.
                         
          He stamps his foot and the table - and everyone sitting at
          it, Renai, Josh and Elise - go flying backwards as if pushed
          by a hurricane, smashing into the wall with crushing power.
                         
          We realize that Dalton was not sitting at the table, but
          squatting down awkwardly. Painfully.
                         
          He stands up, then steps forward. As Josh and Renai watch,
          his KNEE begins to BEND BACKWARDS, the tendons stretching and
          snapping, the knee bending in the opposite direction.
                         
          His other knee follows and he steps forward - both knees
          bending back.
                         
          Specs is rigid in his chair, rooted to the spot, notepad
          still in hand. When he looks up at Dalton, the flashlight
          under his chin shines in Dalton's eyes.
                         
          Dalton ROARS and advances forward - SLAPPING Specs with the
          force of ten men. Specs reels backwards, hitting the wall,
          smashing his head and crumpling like paper.
                         
          Elise stands to face Dalton. The CAMERA FLASH goes off again,
          lighting the darkened room for a split second and showing
          Elise the lipstick-smeared face of a demon instead of
          Dalton's face.
                         
          Tucker SHRINKS BACK as he captures all this with the video camera.
                         
          Dalton steps forward again and Elise CHARGES at him, grabbing
          Dalton by the hair.

          seems ripped straight from the bowels of Lucifer himself.

          then CLIMBING IT, arcing his body into the far corner of the

           Dalton?
                         
          He glances into an empty kitchen. Food rots on the table.
                         
          His footsteps have no sound as he continues on.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Dalton?
                         
          He passes a door that is partly open. He pushes it wide open.
                         
                         
          INT. SMALL ROOM, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The room is small and empty. A strange room...like a stage.
                         
          A figure is sitting in the corner, facing the wall like a
          child being punished at school.
                         
          Josh steps closer, cautious. Takes another step.
                         
                          JOSH
           Where is Dalton?
                         
          He steps closer yet again.
                         
          His hand reaches out to touch the figures back...
                         
          ...his fingers are almost grazing the figures shoulder.
                         
          Soft laughter behind him. Josh glances back to look for the
          source.
                         
          When he turns back, the FIGURE IS GONE.
                         
          He wheels around, seeing the small-statured figure of the
          DWARF that Renai encountered, stepping through the door of
          the room.
           87.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Josh sidles back into the corridor. His pace is sluggish,
          dream-like.
                         
          Frustrated, he stops. Then turns to his left.
                         
          SOMEONE IS RIGHT THERE IN HIS FACE. A MAN.
                         
          The man is not looking at him...only standing very close. His
          neck lolls on his shoulders...around and around. He seems
          stuck on a loop. He is dressed in a fifties era suit.
                         
                          JOSH
           Do you know where Dalton is?
                         
          The man doesn't acknowledge him.
                         
                          MAN
           Why do I have to put up with you?
           What a tramp. You call this a home?
           I work all day for this?
                         
          He marches away, leaving Josh standing alone.
                         
          Josh keeps going, whirling around. He reaches a set of stairs.
          The stairs descend into darkness.
                         
          Josh squints into the dark, afraid.
                         
                          JOSH
           Dalton? Where are you?
                         
          The low rumble of this place is the only reply. Josh turns to
          walk away. A distant voice stops him.
                         
           DALTON (O.S.)
           Dad...
                         
          Josh SNAPS back.
                         
          The voice drifted from out of the darkness at the bottom of
          the stairs.
                         
          Josh scurries down the creaky ramp towards it.
                         
                         
          INT. HALLWAY, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The core of a rotten apple. The bowels of hell.
                         
          Drenched in shadow, Josh fumbles forward into yet another
          corridor of this labyrinth.
           88.
                         
                         
          He realizes he knows where he is. He is in his OLD HOUSE. An
          alternate world version of it.
                         
          The lighting is different - it's darker. There are no signs
          of life. Water drips somewhere.
                         
          Josh stumbles forward, seeing an open door.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Josh slinks into a darkened and dilapidated living room.
                         
          There are THREE PEOPLE in here - a middle aged woman, a middle
          aged man and a young girl. They are all FROZEN, standing in
          place as if someone had hit the pause button on their life.
                         
          The woman is in the middle of ironing. The man is sitting in an
          arm chair reading a newspaper. The girl is lying on the floor.
                         
          The whole scene looks like a macabre `Leave It To Beaver'
          tableau - a cheerful family frozen in time.
                         
          Josh steps closer to the mother...
                         
          ...hairs prickling up on his neck when he sees her BLINK. Her
          body moves slightly. She is not frozen - merely playing
          statues. Like a street performer keeping as still as possible.
                         
          Josh turns to the father. He is the same. His hand shakes,
          struggling to hold the newspaper in place.
                         
          He backs away from them, truly creeped out. His back hits a
          window and he turns, peering through the glass down at the
          street below.
                         
          A figure, hidden in silhouette, is gazing up at him.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Josh stalks into a kitchen off the living room. A weathered
          door is adjacent to the kitchen.
                         
          The door is ajar.
                         
          Through it, Josh can see somebodies leg.
                         
          Josh approaches the door, prodding it open gently with his
          finger.
                         
          It is a bedroom. A tattered cot sits against the wall. A
          YOUNG MAN (17) sits on the cot, holding a rifle. Like the
          others, he is trying to be completely still, as if on pause.
           89.
                         
                         
          He is having more trouble than the family, trembling
          slightly.
                         
                          JOSH
           I'm looking for my son, Dalton.
                         
          The boy does not look up. Does not move.
                         
          Josh retreats, scanning the kitchen. There are soiled pots in
          the sink. Rotting food, but no bugs. Josh turns the faucet
          but no water comes forth.
                         
          When he turns back, the YOUNG MAN is gone. No longer in his
          bedroom.
                         
          Josh glances back at the living room.
                         
          The Young Man is now standing inside the living room.
                         
          Again, he is frozen. Holding his rifle. Looking down at his
          family, who are now splayed out on the carpet, soaked in
          BLOOD.
                         
          Each of them has a bullet hole in their head.
                         
          Repulsed, Josh tip-toes past them. He looks down at the
          mother - a bullet wound in the center of her chest.
                         
          She blinks...still playing dead.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          More corridors disappearing into darkness.
                         
          Josh wrenches his hair in frustration. He boils over,
          screaming at the top of his lungs.
                         
                          JOSH

          His cry recedes into nothingness.
                         
           DALTON (O.S.)
           Dad....
                         
          He heard that. Excited, he spins around, trying to determine
          where it came from.
                         
          As he does, he sees that the entire dead family is now
          gathered at the door to the living room. Watching him.
                         
          He summons all his strength and starts running, backing away
          from them.
           90.
                         
                         
          He drives himself to move faster and faster.

          A figure suddenly appears at the end of the hallway.
                         
          It is the LONG HAIRED MAN IN THE GREY JACKET. The man who

          He licks his lips.
                         
           LONG HAIRED MAN (CONT'D)
           There is a place that you can't go

          He is only a few yards from Josh now. He SCREAMS with awesome
          power, his spit flying.

          He CHARGES at Josh, screaming with hellfire fury.
                         
          Josh recoils, falling onto the floor, screaming.

          Mold caked pillars support a ceiling of gold flakes, the rest

          The room is littered with hundreds of discarded CHILDREN'S

          white-faced, black-haired doll we recognize). They are
          scattered about like bones, collecting dust in the shadows.

          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
                         
          We have returned to the previous scene - only now we are
          seeing it through Elise's eyes.
                         
          Elise is sitting on the couch, alone. Trying to recover from
          the nights events.
                         
          She glances up when Josh approaches her.
                         
                          JOSH
           You introduced me to a new world.
                         
                          ELISE
           No. You've been there before,
           remember? And you'll go back.
                          (BEAT)
           All of us will...eventually.
                         
                          JOSH
           Maybe I can forget again.
                         
          Once again, we see him reach into his jacket, taking out the
          photos Lorraine gave him.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           I'll start by giving these back.
                         
          As he hands them to Elise, she sees with fear that his hand
          is withered and wrinkled.
                         
          Shocked, she looks up at his face.
           105.
                         
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           What's wrong?
                         
          Elise stands up, not knowing how to react.
                         
                          ELISE
           Nothing, I...
                         
          She turns away, reaching for something. We see her scoop up
          Tucker's digital camera.
                         
                          JOSH
           What's the matter, Elise?
                         
          She spins around and lifts Tucker's camera up to her face,
          aiming it at him. She depresses the trigger and takes a photo
          of him, bathing the whole corridor in white light.
                         
          --and in that split second, Josh is replaced by the Old
          Woman!
                         
          Elise lowers the camera, horrified. For a beat, the Old Woman
          just glares at her...
                         
          ...then she CHARGES at Elise, arms outstretched, wrapping her
          white hands around the soft flesh of Elise's throat.
                         
          Elise CHOKES, eyes bulging, spittle flying from her mouth, as
          the pale hands of the Old Woman dig into her thorax, droplets
          of blood running down her chest where the yellowing finger-
          nails have CUT IN to the flesh.
                         
          The Old Woman smiles - a merciless harlequin grin that mocks
          Elise's pain.
                         
          She lets Elise go, letting her drop to the floor.
                         
          The Old Woman turns and glares down the corridor. Something
          has caught her attention. A distant scream.
                         
                         
          INT. BATHROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          The door groans open, a blade of light penetrating pitch
          black darkness.
                         
          The silhouette of the Old Woman floats ethereally into the
          bathroom. She steps up to the mirror, then reaches into her
          tattered Victorian dress and produces a candle.
                         
          She lights the candle with a match, holding it beneath her
          chin and glaring into the reflective surface of the mirror.
           106.
                         
                         
          Instead of seeing her own reflection though, she sees THROUGH
          the mirror as if it were a window.
                         
          In it, she can see the BASEMENT of the Lambert's previous
          residence.
                         
          Josh bursts into the basement, carrying Dalton.
                         
                          DALTON
           Put me down, I can run!
                         
          Josh sets Dalton down, who scampers up the stairs.
                         
          We are watching the same scene we saw earlier play out in the
          mirror.
                         
          Josh is about to follow when he turns and spies a familiar
          face. He looks at the Old Woman...seeing her through the
          `window'.
                         
                          DALTON (CONT'D)
           Come on, dad! Come on!
                         
                          JOSH
           Go! I'm right behind you!
                         
          Dalton disappears as Josh glares at the woman.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           You...what do you want from me?
                         
          He approaches the mirror. WE CIRCLE AROUND the Old Woman,
          past the mirror and THROUGH THE BATHROOM WALL, emerging on
          the other side in--
                         
                         
          INT. BASEMENT, LAMBERT HOME, INSIDE THE FURTHER
                         
          --the basement.
                         
          Josh screams at the Old Woman as she stares at him through
          what he thinks is a window. THEY HAVE SWAPPED PLACES. He is
          now in The Further, and she is in our world.
                         
                          JOSH
           Get away the fuck away from me. I'm
           not scared of you, just leave me
           alone! Get away from me!
                         
          We KEEP CIRCLING, wiping past Josh's back and completing a
          360 degree turn, THROUGH THE WALL and back into--
           107.
                         
                         
          INT. BATHROOM, NEW HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          --our world.
                         
          The Old Woman smiles at Josh's rage. She finds it amusing.
                         
          With an eerily unblinking gaze, she snuffs out the plume of
          flame with a single puff of breath...plunging the bathroom
          into darkness...
                         
          ...and snuffing out Josh forever...
                         
                         
                         
          ...and ever.
                         
           FADE OUT.
