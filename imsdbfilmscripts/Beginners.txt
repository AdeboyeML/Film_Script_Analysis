          Oliver and Arthur sit in a chair next to a couch where a man
          dressed as a witch, complete with green face and long black
          hair, is lying back as if in a traditional analysis session.

                          LONG-HAIRED MAN
           Well, I didn't ask for this. Who
           would ask for this? This color.
           This nose. This cheek, this chin.
           You know, this is my life. This
           isn't a story. This isn't a
           joke...
          Oliver is playing along, but he's really not emotionally
          ready for this party. He feels very far away.

          The witch moves on.
          Oliver sits with Arthur in his lap, alone, lost in all this
          joviality.
          We see that the woman dressed as Julius Rosenberg is watching
          him.
          Just as Oliver is about to get up, she plops herself down
          onto the couch, ready for her session.

           Oh, I was just- I was gonna take a
           break, actually.

          not going to give it up.

           I don't understand. You can't
           talk? Is it a mental problem? Do
           you need analysis?
          She writes on her pad: "I have laryngitis"

           That's a physical problem.
          She smiles at him, looks at him a little too long, Oliver is
          more and more pulled in by her playfulness - she writes:
          "Why are you at a party if you're sad?"
          CU on Oliver, surprised and impressed by her observation.

          runs a finger across Oliver's brow and the outline of his
          face, he's so vulnerable, she lovingly/mischievously squishes
          his face together and messes up his hair. Then she leans in,
          and they kiss for the first time - delicately.

          Oliver smiles. He moves away from the window.

           For example... here is mad.
          Anna passes her hand across her face, and she's "mad".

           Happy...

          She points at her blank face.

           another way.

          They walk through a caged-in freeway overpass - Oliver is
          carrying Arthur while blindfolding Anna with his hands. Over
          this we hear the sounds of the quiet hotel room and an
          intimate conversation between them.

           You don't know me. I like that.

           goes down to about here. You smoke
           in non-smoking rooms.
          Oliver is still covering her eyes, leading her to a certain
          point, the busy sound of the freeway fading up...

           Okay, open your eyes...
          HIGH ANGLE on huge trucks and traffic racing just beneath
          Oliver and Anna's feet under the overpass. The trucks lay on
          their horns as they pass, scaring and thrilling them.
          MOMENTS LATER: they walk alongside the LA river together, arm
          in arm, happy. The intimate conversation continues in voice
          over.

           ANNA (V.O.)
           Oh yeah? You drive on the sidewalk.
           You were raised by animals.

           you just got here.
          They meet up with friends on the banks of the river.

           You will have all their mail
           forwarded to your address. You will
           write their obituary. You run it
           with a photo in the paper for two
           dollars a word. You will wonder if
           it's right. You'll throw a lot of
           their stuff away. You'll bring a
           lot of their stuff to your house.

           When I was a kid I thought that was
           my arm giving her daisies. Now I
           make a new mistake and think it's
           her arm giving me the daisies,
           saying, here, here's simple and
           happy. That's what I meant to give
           you.

           No. No, it's because my father
           loved you so much.
          This hits Andy hard. Oliver turns to leave but can't. He
          turns back, goes to Andy and they hug.

           Dining room...
          Oliver laughs nervously. In the dining room, Hal's old boxes
          are still stacked along the walls. Oliver leans forward and
          pulls something out of a box.
          She looks at a personal ad application, with the picture of
          Hal in the open jean jacket we saw at the beginning of the
          film.
