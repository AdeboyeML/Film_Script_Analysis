                             TERMINATOR



A1      TITLE SEQUENCE - SLITSCAN EFFECT                       A1

1       EXT. SCHOOLYARD - NIGHT                                1

        Silence.  Gradually the sound of distant traffic becomes
        audible.  A LOW ANGLE bounded on one side by a chain-link
        fence and on the other by the one-story public school build-
        ings.  Spray-can hieroglyphics and distant streetlight sha-
        dows.  This is a Los Angeles public school in a blue collar
        neighborhood.

        ANGLE BETWEEN SCHOOL BUILDINGS, where a trash dumpster looms
        in a LOW ANGLE, part of the clutter behind the gymnasium.
        A CAT enters FRAME.  CAMERA DOLLIES FORWARD, prowling with
        him through the landscape of trash receptacles and shadows.

        CLOSE ON CAT, which freezes, alert, sensing something just
        beyond human perception.

        A sourceless wind rises, and with it a keening WHINE.
        Papers blow across the pavement.
        The cat YOWLS and hides under the dumpster.
        Windows rattle in their frames.
        The WHINE intensifies, accompanied now by a wash of frigid
        PURPLE LIGHT.  A CONCUSSION like a thunderclap right over-
        head blows in all the windows facing the yard.

        C.U. - CAT, its eyes are wide as the glare dies.


1A/FX   ANGLE - DUMPSTER                                       1A/FX

        ELECTRICAL DISCHARGES arc from the dumpster to a water
        faucet and climb a drain pipe like a Jacob's Ladder.

2       EXT. SCHOOLYARD - NIGHT                                2

        SLOW PAN as the sound of stray electrical CRACKLING subsides.
        FRAME comes to rest on the figure of a NAKED MAN kneeling,
        faced away, in the previously empty yard.
        He stands, slowly.
        The man is in his late thirties, tall and powerfully built,
        moving with graceful precision.

        C.U. - MAN, his facial features reiterate the power of his
        body and are dominated by the eyes, which are intense, blue
        and depthless.  His hair is military short.

        This man is the TERMINATOR.

        He glances down, taking calm inventory of himself, and
        notices that a fine white ash covers his skin.  He brushes
        at it unconcernedly as he walks toward the fence, scanning
        his surroundings.

                                              CUT TO:


2A/FX   CRANE SHOT - SCHOOLYARD/CITY - NIGHT                   2A/FX

        CAMERA MOVES UP as Terminator approaches the schoolyard fence
        beyond which is an embankment rolling down in darkness to the
        cityscape below.  The school is perched at the edge of a pro-
        montory offering a respectable view of the urban sprawl teem-
        ing and glistening under a sullen sky.  The night clouds are
        shot through with occasional flashes of LIGHTNING, presaging
        a thunderstorm.

        Terminator stands, hands on hips in prefect symmetry, gazing
        down at the city as the CAMERA REACHES FULL HEIGHT.

                                              CUT TO:


3       EXT. PLAYGROUND - NIGHT                               3

        A beer bottle SMASHES on the ground.  PULL BACK to include
        its ex-owner and his two compatriots, YOUTH GANG MEMBERS,
        lounging on the jungle gym of a deserted playground.  They
        sport nondescript PUNK REGALIA...torn T-shirts, fatigue
        pants, combat boots or high-top sneakers, leather jackets.

        The leader notices something and sits up.

                                LEADER
                           (pointing)
                     Hey, hey...what's wrong with
                     this picture?

        ANGLE - REVERSE, seen past the lounging toughs, Terminator
        walks naked into a pool of streetlight, striding purpose-
        fully toward them.

        ANGLE - OVER TERMINATOR'S SHOULDER, as he approaches them.
        They slide from their perches and drop easily to the ground
        liquid shadows.

                                LEADER
                     Nice night for a walk, eh?

        Terminator stops right in front of them.

                                TERMINATOR
                           (without inflec-
                           tion)
                      Nice night for a walk.

        They surround him, all swagger and malign good humor.

                                SECOND PUNK
                      Washday tomorrow, huh?  Nothing
                      clean, right?

        Terminator eyes them without expression, unhurried.
        Reptilian.

                                TERMINATOR
                      Nothing clean.  Right.

                                LEADER
                      This guy's a couple bricks
                      short.

        Terminator turn to the second punk, ignoring the
        others.

                                TERMINATOR
                      Your clothes.  Give them to me.

        The punks exchange glances, dismayed.

                                TERMINATOR
                           (coldly)
                      Now.

                                SECOND PUNK
                           (bracing)
                      Fuck you, asshole.


        Without warning Terminator hammer-punches him in the temple
        with blinding speed.  The blow flings him with a CLANG into
        the jungle gym.  He drops to the ground in a still heap,
        eyes open, twitching.

        The leader whips out his SWITCHBLADE and slashes in one
        motion.  Terminator ducks back and catches the knife-
        wielder's wrist in an inhuman grip.  Then he punches the
        leader with piledriver force just below the breastbone.

        ANGLE - PAVEMENT, as the knife clatters down.  The punk's
        combat boots are on tiptoe, barely touching the ground.

        ANGLE - TWO SHOT, Terminator and the leader are close
        together as if dancing, but motionless.  Their bodies are in
        total shadow.  The punk's eyes are wide, his veins distended
        with an agonizing pressure.  Terminator jerks his fist back
        with a WET SOUND and the other drops OUT OF FRAME.

        The last tough is stumbling away, gaping with terror.  He
        backs into a chainlink fence, turns to run along it, finds
        he is in a corner.

        Terminator takes a step toward him, his gaze ominous.

        The punk begins shakily stripping off his clothes.
        Thunder peals overhead.

                                               CUT TO:

4       EXT. STREET/NEARBY - NIGHT                             4

        A light RAIN begins to fall.
        Terminator emerges onto the street from the playground,
        pausing in the pool of light under a streetlight to hike
        the collar of the punk's jacket.
               The rain streams down over his face, running into
        and over his eyes.  They do not blink.

                                               CUT TO:

5       EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET/ALLEY - NIGHT                     5

        Another part of the city.  Seedy apartments and storefronts.
        The streets glisten, hissing with sporadic late night traffic.
        SLOW PAN AND DOLLY into the mouth of a narrow alley lined
        with trash containers and fire escapes.  From a recessed
        doorway, two filthy legs sprawl out onto the wet pavement.
        An angry, inarticulate DRUNKARD'S MONOLOGUE rises occasionally
        above the rain sounds.

        ANGLE - DOORWAY,  The derelict rouses from his bitter stupor
        as a brilliant purple glare lights up the wet brickwork
        around him.  A shockwave hurls trash into the air.
        Painted over windows shatter.
        Rat scurry, blinded.

        A FIGURE drops INTO FRAME as if out of the sky and smacks
        the pavement with a muddy splash.

        C.U. - DERELICT, as he blinks at the fading glare, amazed.

        A NAKED MAN, compact and muscular, rises in a defensive
        crouch.  KYLE REESE is 22, but his face has been aged by
        ordeal, the mouth hard, eyes grim.  A crinkled burn scar
        traverses one side of his face from chin to forehead.  Other
        scars, from burns and bullets, mar his hard-muscled body.

        The rain washes a fine coating of white ash from his skin
        as electrical ARCS lace back and forth between the fire
        escapes behind him, HISSING and SPUTTERING.  The sound
        fades, then stops altogether, to be replaced by a rising
        scream of animal agony.

        Reese lurches to his feet and sprints across the alley.

                                               CUT TO:

7       EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT                               7

        CAMERA MOVES WITH REESE as he leaps to the fire escape and
        clambers up to the first landing to crouch beside another
        NAKED MAN who appears to be entangled in the ironwork.  The
        man is contorted with pain as his screams die to a shivering
        gasp.  CLOSER ANGLE reveals that he has been skewered through
        the abdomen by the horizontal iron slats and through the
        shoulder by a railing.  He has materialized in the same
        space occupied by the fire escape structure.  The figure
        slumps, motionless.

        Reese quickly checks for signs of life.  The man is dead.

        Reese descend to the alley floor and crosses to the drunk
        huddled in the doorway.

        A pair of flamboyantly dressed women, obviously working
        girls, passes by the alley mouth.  They do a double take
        when they see Reese, but walk on without breaking stride,
        completely jaded.  He's certainly not a potential customer.

        Reese crouches down as if to speak to the drunk.

                                DERELICT
                      Say, buddy...did you see a
                      real bright light?

                                               CUT TO:

8       EXT. ALLEY/SAME - NIGHT                                8

        A brilliant white glare stabs into the alley mouth as an
        LAPD cruiser glides slowly by on the street.  The search-
        light illuminates the figure of Reese, crouching over the
        sprawled drunk, just pulling on the other's trousers.

        The cruiser chirps to a stop.  The doors fly open and two
        cops leap out.

                                FIRST COP
                      Hold it, right there!

        Reese hitches his pants and bolt like a shot.  The cops
        draw their guns and race into the alley after him.

        HANDHELD CAMERA or PANAGLIDE, rushing with Reese along the
        narrow alley.  He vaults a pile of tumbled trashcans.
        Whips around a corner.  Leaps the hood of a parked car in
        the cross alley.

        PANAGLIDE PRECEDING COPS, as they snake through the night
        maze.

                                               CUT TO:

9       EXT. CROSS ALLEY - NIGHT                               9

        PANAGLIDE WITH REESE as he hits a chain link gate at a
        dead run and scrambles over it.

10      EXT. ALLEY JUNCTION - NIGHT                            10

        WHIP PAN ON COPS, skidding to a stop at the corner in time
        to see Reese vault the fence.  They separate.

        DOLLY WITH SECOND COP, as he runs to the gate.

                                               CUT TO:

11      EXT. ALLEY/NEARBY - NIGHT                              11

        LOW PANAGLIDE WITH REESE, running full tilt, displaying
        incredible agility.

        REESE'S POV, the alley walls blur by.  The view of a hot-
        wired rat in an urban maze.

        C.U. - REESE, CAMERA hugging him as he sprints and turns,
        alternately front-lit, side-lit and silhouetted as the
        electric glare of the city wheels about him.

        ANGLE - ALLEY MOUTH, Reese flashes though intermittent
        cross-lighting in the B.G.

        Another unit arrives out front and Reese melts back into
        the alley, only to see a cop round the corner behind him.
        Sandwiched.  Reese crashes into a steel door, rending the
        lock, and vanishes into the darkness within.

        The newly arrived cops are a K-9 unit.  They open the back
        door of the squad car to release a large black Doberman.

                                               CUT TO:


12      INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT                          12

        Reese finds himself among the display racks of a discount
        department store.  A searchlight stabs in the front
        window as he dashes into the maze of aisles.

        Three cops enter behind him through the shattered door.

        FAST PANAGLIDE WITH REESE, as he crab-runs low among the
        moving shadows where flashlights quarter the darkness.  He
        bolts the open space behind a display window.  Sees the
        outside searchlight sweep toward him.  Freezes.

        ANGLE - REESE, his feral face frozen among the smooth-
        featured, smiling mannequins.  As the light passes, Reese
        silently moves on.

        ANGLE - COP, passing the end of a long aisle B.G. while in
        the F.G. a hand ENTERS FRAME, removing a knit shirt from a
        hanger.  Reese slips the shirt on quietly and does a fast
        crab-walk across the aisles to melt into the other racks
        and shadows, CAMERA MOVING LOW with him.

                                               CUT TO:


13      INT. DEPARTMENT STORE/AISLE - NIGHT                    13

        With a shocking GROWL the police dog hurtles out of the
        shadows, LEAPING RIGHT AT CAMERA.

        ANGLE - REESE AND DOG, a dark blur with teeth, extremely
        Doberman, flies toward Reese.  He spins.  Catches it by
        the throat in mid-air. Arcs it to the floor with unflinching
        precision.

        C.U. - DOBERMAN, suddenly on its back and held by the throat,
        THE DOG YELPS and stares at Reese, who leans very close.
        Inches from its eyes he fixes it with a gaze of uncompromis-
        ing dominance.  Some ancient communication seems to pass
        between the two.

        Reese releases the animal and turns his back on it, selecting
        a long overcoat from a rack.  The dog backs away from him,
        stiff-legged and confused.

                                               CUT TO:


14      INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT                          14

        TRACKING WITH REESE as he rounds a corner on the run, still
        shrugging into his long coat.
        Running smack at him is another cop, gun aimed.

        Without slowing, Reese leaps toward him, twisting in mid-air
        like a cat.  The cop FIRES. Misses.  Goes down under Reese's
        tackle and they slide together on the polished floor.

        Before they even come to rest Reese snatches the cop's gun,
        aiming it at the other's face two-handed.

                                REESE
                      What day is it?  The date...

                                COP
                      Thursday...uh...May twelfth.

                                REESE
                           (viciously)
                      What year?

        A SHOT whines off the metal side of an escalator behind
        Reese's head.  He vaults the escalator rail, leaving the
        amazed cop lying on the floor.

        Reese bounds up the frozen steps, pocketing the .38 Police
        Special in his coat.

        Cops dash through the maze of aisles, converging at the
        escalators.

                                               CUT TO:

15      INT. DEPARTMENT STORE/SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT             15

        WHIP PANNING WITH REESE, as he hurtles between displays.
        He stops for a moment beside a rack of shoes.  Slaps one of
        a pair of tennis shoes sole-to-sole against his bare foot.
        Too small.  Another.  Holding the shoes he runs on.

                                               CUT TO:

16      EXT. SECOND FLOOR FIRE ESCAPE LANDING - NIGHT          16

        A door opens quietly and Reese slips out.

        CAMERA TRACKS WITH HIM as he moves like a panther along the
        narrow catwalk.  TILT DOWN to include the first LAPD cruiser
        parked at the mouth of the alley.

                                               CUT TO:

17      EXT. ALLEY/STREET - NIGHT                              17

        Reese drops cat-like beside the unattended police car.
        Cautiously, he opens the door of the cruiser, removes the
        RIOT GUN, an Ithaca pump model, from the dash rack and slips
        it under his coat.  Cradled in a vertical position, the
        shortened weapon is virtually invisible.

        He walks out onto the street and away,  unhurriedly, an
        innocuous pedestrian soon lost in the rain.

                                               CUT TO:


18      EXT. STREET/NEARBY - NIGHT                             18

        Reese enters a telephone booth.  Harsh light rakes across
        his face, outlining the long scar.  He opens the directory,
        leafs through it.

        ANGLE - MACRO ON PAGE, Reese's finger slides down a column.
        Stops beside the following listings in the big metropolitan
        white pages:
        CONNOR, SARAH
        CONNOR, SARAH ANN
        CONNOR, SARAH J.

        The night's rain has given way to a typical L.A. morning
        of diffuse sunlight.

        MOVING WITH A GIRL on a MOPED as she zips through traffic.
        SARAH CONNER is 19, small and delicate-featured.  Pretty in
        a flawed, accessible way. She doesn't stop the party when
        she walks in, but you'd like to get to know her.  Her vulner-
        able quality masks a strength even she doesn't know exists.

        Sarah maneuvers nimbly, apparently in a hurry.

        Sarah buzzes into the parking lot of Big Bob's Family
        Restaurant and chains the moped to the icon of Big Bob
        himself.  The fiberglass cherub holds up his mammoth
        hamburger in perpetual homage to whatever deity watches
        out for fat kids.
        Sarah removes a stack of college textbooks from the luggage
        carrier and tuns to go into the restaurant.

                                SARAH
                           (to Big Bob)

        The office is closet-like, lit by the glow of several
        security monitors.  CHUCK BREEN, day manager, pimply and
        officious,watches Sarah in an overhead view of the service
        corridor.  He punches a switch and reaches for a microphone
        on a studio gooseneck.

                                BREEN (V.O.)
                      Sarah?

        She answers the empty hallway.

        She turns back toward the office door at the end of the

                      You're late.

        Sarah is undaunted.

                                SARAH
                      Aren't I worth waiting for?

                                BREEN
                      Not really.  Do you think you
                      can get here on time if I put
                      you on the floor as a waitress?

                           (grinning)
                      I don't know.  I kinda had
                      my heart set on being a
                      cashier the rest of my life.

                                BREEN
                      The pay's the same but you'll
                      make more in tips.

                                SARAH
                      Thanks, Chuck.  I need the

                      money.  Can I still work the
                      hours around my classes?

        Breen turns to punch up a display on the restaurant's
        small accounting computer.  Sarah looks over his shoulder
        as he modifies the week's schedule.

                                BREEN
                      Mmm.  Same schedule's okay.

                                SARAH
                      Alright!

                                BREEN

                      It's not brain surgery,
                      Chuck.

        Breen hands her an apron ceremoniously.

                                BREEN
                      Here you go.  You're a

        Sarah confronts her reflection in the mirror, pondering

        She pinches her sheeks.

        the ignition assembly and strips the wires with a brutal

        Terminator passes the appliance section, and the pictures

        he walks by, returning to normal behind him.

        He enters the store.

        Instead of replying, Terminator takes a box of shotgun shells
        from a stack on the display case.

        bear-like, slab-handed, but Terminator doesn't even glance
        back as he steps in to take the man's place.

        Sarah is bustling about, trying to service the start of
        the dinner rush.  In waitress parlance, she's 'in it'.
        She runs the gauntlet between tables, precariously balancing
        two full dinner plates on one arm and hand-carrying a
        third.  A customer tugs on her apron for attention and she
        barely averts contributing the chili size to his wardrobe.

                      Yes sir, just a second.

        She reaches her table after near collisions with a Mexican
        busboy and two teenage girls doing cheerleading routines
        in lock-step.

        She stares down at the mess melting over her hard-earned

        She gasps and stops in her tracks as Terminator smoothly
        pulls the .45 from under his jacket and snaps the cocking
        slide.

        Installed on her bed for an afternoon of 'soaps' is the
        WRONG SARAH CONNOR.  ELECTRODE PADS exercise her doughy
        thighs as the 35 year old divorcee watches "GENERAL HOSPITAL".
        She calls out distractedly:

                      What is it, Mom?

        She jumps as the door BANGS open.  And stares in dumb
        amazement as the good-looking, intense-eyed man in the
        strange clothes raises a pistol.

        And aims it at her face.

        It all seems less real than "GENERAL HOSPITAL" in that
        half-second before he FIRES.

        the SHOT.  The silence stretches for several BEATS.  Then
        FIVE MORE SHOTS are heard.
        The woman screams and drops the phone as she stares upward.

        ANGLE ON CEILING above her.  With each successive shot a
        chuck of plaster explodes off the ceiling.

        He unhurriedly removes the spent clip, reloads the weapon
        and replaces it under his jacket.

        Crouching down, he turns the woman's body over, confirming
        that she is dead.

        door open.

        Terminator stands at the head of the stairs.
        His hand is bloody where he grasped the dead woman's
        shoulder.

        He starts down the stairs.
        The mother stands paralyzed, unable to breathe.
        He reaches the main floor and walks toward her.
        She edges into a corner, eyes wide.
        He reaches out.

        And wipes his hands clean on her apron.

        Terminator walks out, without expression, leaving the
        woman to sag to the floor in a faint.

        TIGHT ON KYLE REESE'S HANDS as they make the last few
        strokes with a hacksaw to sever the wooden stock from
        the riot gun.  It clatters to the ground, leaving a short
        stump, like a pistol grip.

        CUT WIDER as Reese hefts the weapon.  He is crouched in
        an underground service tunnel below a busy street.  Shadows
        of people walking across a grating in the sidewalk above
        him flicker past.  They can't see him in the darkness below
        their feet as he checks the gun's action carefully.  He
        slips it under his overcoat where it hangs from a jerry-
        rigged sling.

        Reese emerges from a stairwell behind a service station,
        his overcoat done up to the top button.
        He walks through the sparse morning crowd on the cluttered,
        overbuilt commercial street.
        He is out of sync.
        A stranger in a strange land.
        He holds himself tightly reined, cautious and feral as he
        moves among the unconcerned pedestrians.
        His eyes flick rapidly about.
        He is seeing this Babylon for the first time.

        Reese stops at a hole-in-the-wall take-out stand.  He
        watches people walk away with food.  Moves closer.
        Scrutinizes the next man as he orders.

                      Gimme a falafel with yogurt
                      dressing and, uh, Baco-bits.

        The counterman hands him his food and change wordlessly
        as Reese steps up.

                      That'll be one-sixty.

                      Aha!  Is she young?

        Mr. Miller lowers his menu and glares at her.

        pretty enough when still, but stunning in motion.  And she's

        Ginger walks over to Sarah as the class disperses.  Marco
        is leaning on the wall next to Sarah, who is enjoying the

        Before Marco can reply, Ginger pulls the front of his gym
        shorts out and peers down.  She shakes her head.

                                GINGER
                      You're wasting your time, kiddo.
                      Let's go.

        She grabs Sarah by the arm and pulls her out the door.
        Sarah catches a glimpse of Marco's expression over her
        shoulder as the door closes.

        In F.G., two Conan-esque arms thrust upward, glistening.
        Ginger's boyfriend, MATT McCALLISTER, the assistant manager

        enormous weight on the Nautilus machine.
        Despite his imposing appearance, Matt is one of the warmest
        people you'd ever want to meet.
        His face is contorted, muscles knotted for the last push.
        He heaves it up with a guttural cry.
        Lowering his weights with a CLANG, Matt lies panting, arms
        dangling at his side, eyes closed.

                      'Bye beautiful.  You too,
                      Ginger.

        Two weightlifters nearby look at each other, than at Matt.

                      Bunky?

        Sarah lurches away from the curb on her moped, almost
        spilling Ginger who is attempting to ride double.  They
        swing out onto a main thoroughfare and careen through
        the bumper-to-bumper traffic.
        Sarah maneuvers deftly though overloaded and unstable.
        Ginger doesn't know whether to laugh of scream at the
        near-misses.
        She does both.

        On a side street the girls pass an excavation site  between
        high-rises.  They pass OUT OF FRAME as CAMERA HOLDS on the
        construction area and Ginger's shrieks fade.

        In the F.G., under an overpass, Reese sits is a car watching
        the powerful machines moving earth.
        He's in a late-model non-descript GREY SEDAN, one of a row
        of cars gathering dirt beside the construction site.
        Crab-armed back-hoes and massive caterpillars ROAR through
        a curtain of dust, under intense floodlights.  A power-shovel
        moves its great arm, lighting its own way with an arc-light.

        Reese sits motionless in the dark.  Waiting.  The clock in
        the dash ticks quietly.
        He flips on the radio.  A fatuous POP ROCK STATION.
        Reese fishes a magazine off the dirty floor.  His over-
        coat is off, draped over the shotgun on the seat beside
        him.
        His bare arms are sinewy and scarred.

        Reese flips the page of COSMOPOLITAN.
        He look at the glossy photos, the glossy women.
        Fantasy women.  Svelte and seamless.
        The ads fascinate him too: Caribbean vacations and blended
        whiskeys.
        His head sags against the door.
        He gazes dully at the tracks of a passing CATERPILLAR as they
        chew through the dirt.
        The ROAD and CLATTER of treads intensifies as his eyes close.

        TIGHT ON A GLEAMING STEEL TREAD as it grinds through debris.
        The debris is ferroconcrete, girders, and jackstraw heaps of
        HUMAN BONES, burned black.

        There is the sound of EXPLOSIONS, distant, and an intermittent
        electronic WHINE.  Incredibly bright searchlights play over
        the ground.  PANNING with the moving treads through twisted
        wreckage, F.G.
        The screen WHITES OUT with a BLAST, very close.  As the
        debris clatters down, a helmetted head snaps up into FRAME,
        EXTREME F.G.

        The visor of the HIGH-TECH HELMET is shattered, presumably
        by the explosion.  The wearer rips it off, revealing a
        younger Reese, minus his burn scar.
        His face is bathed in sweat, lit by the glow from a CRT
        SCOPE-SIGHT on a strange-looking rifle.
        The sound of SCREAMS and HOARSE SHOUTS not far off, and a
        continuous low murmuring of RADIO CHATTER, grid coordinates,
        casualties, unit placements, medic requests.

        Reese looks over his shoulder at his teammate, a GIRL
        of about sixteen, gaunt, dirty, heavily armed like himself.
        DOLLYING as they start to belly crawl through the bones
        and wreckage.
        Reese looks up.
        Through spires of a collapsed building a terrifying
        SPHINX-LIKE SHAPE moves against the sky...obscured by dust
        and blinding sweeps of its searchlights.
        Though we see little, this is an H-K,Hunter-Killer
        mobile ground-unit.

        Reese crawls, pacing the H-K, under and through, on elbows
        and knees, past mounds of charred skulls.  They
        pass the BODY OF A CHILD, a boy of about 10, center-
        punched with a smoking hole.  The boy clutches a rifle.
        More bodies.  Some in rags, some in uniforms like theirs.
        WOMEN. OLD MEN. CHILDREN.  They're all dirty and gaunt,
        scabrous.  And still bleeding.  Reese scrabbles past a
        dark rat-hole and there are human rats in it.  Some of them
        are sobbing, or screaming.

        Another EXPLOSION.
        The GLARE lights the huddled few.
        Human vermin with mud-caked weapons that haven't been
        invented yet.  Soldiers in a nightmare war.

        Reese and his teammate stop behind a blasted wall, having
        outflanked the massive H-K.  Its flashing blue lights flick
        across the walls, its searchlights sear through the
        debris.

        WIDER, showing the H-K more clearly...a blast-scarred
        CHROME LEVIATHON, with hydraulic arms folded mantis-like
        against its 'torso', and huge underslung GUN TURRETS.

        Reese leaps up and straight-arms a satchel-charge into its
        path.  One tread rolls over the explosive.
        Guns and searchlights swivel.  The head turns ponderously.
        Reese's partner rises, poised to throw hers.
        A POWER-BOLT catches her at the top of her arc, BLOWING
        HER INTO RED MIST.

        Reese is knocked down by the concussion.  Gets up, running,
        as the charges blow.
        The H-K's tread carriers are RIPPED APART.
        It lurches to a stop, burning.

        The following SEQUENCE is extremely FORESHORTENED.
        CUT FAST.  IMPRESSIONS ONLY.
        Running.
        Explosions light the ruins like flashbulbs.
        ENERGY WEAPONS criss-cross the night like tracers.
        LOW ANGLE, up past the burning H-K as its flying counter-
        part, an AERIAL H-K, arcs into view with a TURBOJET WHINE.

        Reese hauls two survivors of his unit into a PERSONNEL
        CARRIER, a CHEVY CAMARO with steel plate welded over it and
        the roof cut away to access the 50 CALIBER MACHINE GUN.
        It's stripped and rusted and bullet-riddled, glassless.
        The TIRES are OFF-ROAD and very gnarly.

        They're driving through the ruins, up and over and through.
        Reese drives like a demon.  Under other circumstances it
        would be considered insane.  Here it is merely very good.

        The machine gun CHATTERS.
        A BLACK SHAPE descends, a demon with searchlights.
        A BOLT OF LIGHT.

        Reese's car flips like a kicked beer can, rolling and
        crumpling.  He's pinned in the wreck, bloody, screaming
        despite his training.  The only other survivor, an
        emaciated BOY of twelve, is pulling for all he's worth
        to drag Reese out before it burns.

        is a SHOTGUN MUZZLE AIMED RIGHT AT US.
        Reese quivers with a curious spasm, similar to the tremors
        of his arrival, and blinks at the boy.

        The boy is white-faced, staring down the bore.  He backs
        away.  We see that he is straddling a bicycle.

        Sarah and Ginger are crammed into the tiny bathroom,
        becoming inextricably tangled in each other's cords as
        they blow-dry, curl hair, and apply make-up.  Ginger
        has her headphones inverted under her chin but in place,
        and is bouncing to music as she dries her hair.  She is
        wearing a short terry-cloth bathrobe that reveals the
        greater part of her legs.  Sarah is in a skirt and bra.

        The phone rings and Sarah goes out into the living room
        to get it.

                                SARAH
                           (answering the
                           phone)
                      Hello?

                                VOICE (V.O.)
                           (on phone, deep
                           and breathy)
                      First I'm going to rip the
                      buttons off your blouse, one
                      by one...then run my tongue
                      along your neck, down to your
                      bare, gleaming breasts...

        Sarah cups her hand over the mouthpiece and calls out
        matter-of-factly:

                                SARAH
                      Ginger!  It's Matt.

        She resumes listening.

                                MATT (V.O.)
                      ...and then slowly pull your
                      jeans off inch by inch and
                      lick your belly in circles,
                      further and further down...
                      then I'll pull off your panties
                      with my teeth...

        Sarah is repressing laughter.

                                SARAH
                           (crossly)
                      Who is this?

        Silence.  Then Matt realizes to his horror who he's been
        talking to.

                                MATT (V.O.)
                      Oh my God!  Sarah!  Oh, shit.
                      Jesus, I'm sorry.  I thought
                      you were...Can I talk to Ginger?

                                SARAH
                      Sure, Bunky.

        As Ginger approaches, Sarah hands her the receiver and
        goes into the bedroom.

                                GINGER
                      Hello?

                                MATT (V.O.)
                      First I'm gonna rip the buttons
                      off your blouse...

                      Don't wear the beige one.

        Sarah gathers up the blouses and walks out.

                      This guy's probably a schmuck
                      and I don't care what I wear.

        An unmarked car with a clamp-on light and siren blaring
        screeches to the curb behind two marked black-and-whites
        in front of a funky Venice apartment building.  A small
        crowd  is gathered around the front steps.  LIEUTENANT
        ED VUKOVICH, Homicide Division, gets out of the car and
        strides through the crowd.  He's fiftyish, short, but
        square and solid, a human bulldog gone a little to paunch.
        He chews Juicy Fruit gum like a maniac: a chain-chewer.
        He's homely as an old boot.  And he's not a smart cop, he's
        a wise one; rarer still.  The onlookers, gathered patiently
        for their ten second glimpse of something under a sheet,
        separate for him to pass.

        back staircase two steps at a time.  He passes TWO UNIFORMED
        COPS at the doorway of a second-floor apartment, and enters
        to find a quiet flurry of activity.  Several DETECTIVES and
        a PHOTOGRAPHER prowl around, taking evidence, taking pictures.

        In the center of the living room floor is the body of a
        young woman, crumpled face down in a small lake of blood.
        Two bags of groceries lie split open on the floor in front
        of her.

        Vukovich glances up as he is joined by DETECTIVE SGT.
        TRAXLER.  Traxler is black, lean and very jaded.

                                VUKOVICH
                      Give me the short version.

                                TRAXLER
                      Six shots at less than ten
                      feet.  Weapon was a large

                                VUKOVICH
                      No shit.

        Traxler turns to a passing DETECTIVE.

        Ginger enters, stopping beside their phone answering machine.

                                GINGER
                      Not lately.  Did you check

        She checks under the couch, then behind the drapes.  She
        bends down.

        C.U. - PUGSLEY, as the GREEN IGUANA cocks its head, blinking
        vapidly.

        RESUME WIDE, Sarah lifts the three foot long lizard from his
        perch on the windowsill.  She gives the complacent reptile
        a kiss on its blunt snout.

                      Totally nauseating.

        Sarah drapes the lizard across her shoulders where it sits
        contentedly as she looks for her purse.  Ginger has been
        rewinding the message tape.  She punches PLAY and a MALE
        VOICE is heard.

                                VOICE

                      Uh, something's come up and
                      it looks like I won't be able
                      to make it tonight.  I'm really
                      sorry.  Call you in a day or so.
                      Sorry.  'Bye.

        Sarah stands still, crestfallen.

                                GINGER
                      That bum.  So what if he has
                      a Porsche, he can't treat you
                      like that...it's Friday night

                      I'll break his kneecaps.

        Sarah resignedly slips Pugsley off her shoulders.

                      You still love me, don't
                      you, Pugsley?

        She places Pugsley in a large terrarium with a 'BEWARE OF
        DOG' sign taped on the side.

        The book slips out of her fingers.
        Sarah turns and scans the crowd.
        She's getting looks, covert and otherwise, like any unaccom-
        panied girl on a Friday night.  But is that all they mean?

        Sarah back into the women's restroom.

        Sarah stumbles numbly to the sink.
        She splashes her face with cold water.  In the mirror
        her terrified reflection looks back.  Why me?
        She hears a loud clatter and spins around.
        It's just a drunken woman fumbling with a toilet stall door.
        Sarah edges back out into the corridor.

        It's OUT OF ORDER.

        Sarah exits the pizza place into the sparse crowd on the
        sidewalk.  As she passes a figure leaning against the wall
        just outside, the man turns his head to watch her.
        It is Reese, his gaze impassive.
        Streetlight catches the burn scar on his cheek.
        He is motionless, sinister in his long coat.
        Sarah shudders.
        She walks on.

        POV - SARAH, ON CROWD, moving toward and through approaching
        groups of pedestrians.  They seem to be glancing at her.
        Was it always like that and she just never noticed?

        C.U. - SARAH as she look over her shoulder.

        POV - SARAH, ON PIZZA PARLOR DOORWAY.  Reese is gone.
        She resists the urge to run.
        On the opposite side of the street an  LAPD cruiser glides
        slowly by.  Sarah is about to call out but a bus blocks
        her view and when it had passed, the car is turning away
        down a side street.

        She passes a large window with STOKER'S written on it, and
        ducks quickly through the door.

        ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW, SARAH F.G., as Reese approaches.
        Her knuckles clench white as he reaches the entrance and
        walks by, unhurriedly, without a glance inside.
        She turns and scan the gloomy interior, which reveals itself
        to be less than savory.  Pool tables and upper-middle lowlife
        in submarine depths of smoky haze.

        Sarah draws stares, menacing in their own right, as she
        weaves between the pool tables to the back of the bar.
        her hands are trembling as she drops a dime in the pay
        phone and dials.

                                VOICE (V.O./RECORDED)
                      You have reached the Los Angeles

                      a police car sent out to you, please
                      stay on the line...

        Sarah holds the receiver pressed to her ear, glancing
        around, fear feeding on frustration.

        An LAPD black-and-white sits at the curb in front of Sarah's
        building with two cops inside, drinking coffee.  Through
        the open window we hear the dispatcher's voice on the
        radio.

                                DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                      ...two eleven in progress at
                      Seven-Eleven market, Third and
                      Tamarac.  One suspect believed
                      to be armed...

        The car pulls out with lights and siren on.
        A moment later, Terminator rounds the corner of the building
        and climbs the stairs to the entryway.
        He surveys the bank of call buttons, then turns to consider
        the barred security gate.

74      INT. SARAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                         74

        PANAGLIDE WITH GINGER as she ties her terry-cloth robe and,
        leaving Matt in a dead sleep, pads through the dark apartment.
        Down the hall, past the phone with Traxler's message.
        Through the dark living room.
        She has her Walkman in the pocket of her robe and bops to
        herself in the silent gloom as she enters the kitchen.

        When she opens the refrigerator to remove snack fixings, the
        light briefly illuminates the kitchen and in that moment,
        SOMETHING MOVES in the F.G.

        TIGHT ON GINGER, MOVING WITH HER as she backs toward the
        counter with her arms full of snack stuff.

        A SUDDEN CRASH.  A flurry of motion behind her.
        She spins, dropping half her load.
        Ginger fumbles for the lightswitch.

        Revealing Pugsley, sitting there blinking innocently among
        overturned spice bottles on the counter-top.

                                GINGER
                      Shoo.  Go on.  I'll make a
                      belt out of you.

        Pugsley disappears into a large fern by the window and Ginger
        sets about her task, slathering crunchy peanut butter on
        stalks of celery.

        MEDIUM ON MATT, as rustling curtains play patterns of street-
        light over his sleeping face.
        The sound of a faint breeze.
        In the B.G. is the balcony, empty.  The sliding door is open.

        TIGHT ON MATT, as his eyes open at the sound of a quiet,
        repeated CLICKING.

        UP ANGLE - PAST MATT, as the five-inch blade of an industrial
        razor-knife reaches full extension in Terminator's hand,
        right above him.
        It slashes viciously downward.
        Matt rolls and the pillow is SLIT OPEN where his throat had
        been.

                                MATT
                      Whoah!

        Terminator catches him by the hair and slashed down again.
        Matt grabs the wrist in both hands.
        The enormous muscles of his arms, which seem capable of bench
        pressing a Chrysler, strain and knot against the pressure of
        the killer's single arm...
        And still the blade moves closer to his throat.

        With a final heave Matt deflects the down-pressure sideways
        and the blade snaps with a CLINK against the headboard.

        HANDHELD WITH MATT as he rolls off the bed, spins and slams
        his fists together into Terminator's temple.  He picks up a
        brass deco lamp and brings it down with piledriver force.

        Unperturbed, Terminator knocks the lamp away and hurls Matt
        over the bed.

        ecstasy, singing to a celery stalk as if it were a micro-

        Matt heaves himself up, powerful body gleaming with sweat
        and hurls himself upon the intruder.
        The titans CRASH INTO A DRESSER, reducing it to kindling.
        Then into the closet door, EXPLODING THE FULL-LENGTH MIRROR.

        Terminator places one hand on either side of Matt's barrel
        chest.  SINKS HIS FINGERS INTO THE FLESH.  An inhuman grip.
        Matt is raised off the floor, contorted with agony, above
        the other's head.

        DOLLY PRECEDING GINGER as she returns from the kitchen with
        a plate full of celery stalks and a glass of milk.  CAMERA
        passes the closed bedroom door and STOPS, as Ginger pauses
        to set the plate on top of the glass, freeing one hand to
        open the door.

        AN EXPLOSION OF SPLINTERS in close F.G. as a shape smashes
        through the door right in front of her...Matt's body
        propelled halfway through the door by enormous force.
        Ginger shrieks and leaps back, flinging milk and all into
        the air.

        The door begins to open the pressure of Matt's body
        creates resistance.
        Ginger SCREAMS and back away.

        The door is wrenched open and Terminator steps through with
        the massive .45 drawn.

        HANDHELD WITH GINGER, the walls blur by as she runs.

        TIGHT ON TERMINATOR as the pistol RISES INTO FRAME, aligning
        with his eyes.  BOOM!

        LOW FAST DOLLY WITH GINGER as the bullet punches into her
        shoulder, pitching her on her face outside the bathroom door.

        LOW WIDE ANGLE as she crawls forward, gasping, drowning.
        The implacable figure looms behind her.
        Her expression is agony and reeling, nauseating terror.
        And incomprehension: Why am I suddenly dying?
        Her eyes roll, showing the whites, like a horse tethered in
        a burning stable.

        as she pulls herself into the bathroom.
        She clutches the rim of the toilet.

        LOW ANGLE PAST HER, ON TERMINATOR, as he stands behind her.
        PAN UP, off her.  He takes aim.
        And empties the clip.
        He calmly reloads.

        ensuing silence.
        Terminator spins, drawing an instantaneous bead on the source
        of the sound, but doesn't fire.

                      talking to a machine...

        C.U. - TERMINATOR, motionless, listening.

                      ...but don't be shy, it's okay.
                      Machines need love too...

        Terminator turns abruptly back to Ginger's body.  He turns
        it over, assuring himself that she is dead.

                                GINGER'S VOICE
                           (continuing, recorded)

                      Wait for the beep.

        There is a loud tone and the incoming call is heard.

                      Ginger, this is Sarah...

        Terminator's head snaps back and he freezes, listening.
        He rises slowly as Sarah's voice continues.

        TIGHT ON HIS UNBLINKING EYES.

        Terminator is rapidly and methodically rifling the contents
        of Sarah's small desk.  SIREN'S WAIL, approaching.
        He picks up a small card.

        E.C.U. - CARD. It is Sarah's college I.D. card, complete with
        color photo of her.

        MACRO ON PICTURE.

        E.C.U. - TERMINATOR'S EYES as he tosses the card down,
        after a fraction of a second's scan.  Picks up something else.

        TIGHT ON SARAH'S ADDRESS BOOK, Terminator pockets this and
        slips out the balcony door.  Climbing over the railing, he

        The yellow Maverick hurtles along an empty street.

        CLOSER ANGLE as streetlight glare slashes across Terminator's
        face in flaring pulses.

90      INT. PLAIN CAR - NIGHT                                 90

        Vukovich draws his Colt Python .357 Magnum and check the
        load.  Traxler is driving.

                                VUKOVICH
                      Let's see how this guy likes
                      playing hard-ball.

91      INT. STOKER'S BAR - NIGHT                              91

        The waitress set a cup of coffee in front of Sarah.

                                WAITRESS
                      Anything else?

        Sarah shakes her head "No" and contemplates her trembling
        hands.  She half-turns, catching a glimpse of herself in
        the mirror behind the bar.

        TIGHT ON SARAH, reflected in the mirror.  In the F.G. a
        man at the bar looks up from his beer, straight into her eyes.
        It is Reese.
        He gazes at her coolly for a moment, then glances away.

        C.U. - SARAH, feeling trapped, frantic.

        ANGLE ON FRONT DOOR as it opens and a figure stands silhou-
        etted briefly against a streetlight.

        Reese turns, his eyes flickering to the mirror, the figure.

        C.U. - REESE as he mechanically raises his beer.  His knuckles
        are white.  He slowly undoes the top button of his overcoat.
        There is a glint of metal in the shadows within.
        Reese turns slowly on his barstool as the figure brushes past
        him, out-of-focus F.G.
        Sarah looks up.

        E.C.U. - REESE'S HAND sliding slowly along polished steel,
        a caress.  His finger slips through the triggerguard of the
        riot gun.

        MEDIUM ON SARAH, as the man stops in front of her in close F.G.
        He sits slowly in the booth opposite her.  The angle is OVER
        HIS SHOULDER.

                                SARAH
                           (uncertainly)
                     Lieutenant Vukovich?

        REVERSE ANGLE - It is not Lt. Vukovich.
        Terminator sits motionless for a BEAT.
        Blue eyes so pure and deep.  The eyes of a saint, perhaps.

        The .45 is out and cocked and AIMED DIRECTLY AT CAMERA, almost
        in one motion.
        The bore seems enormous.

        BACK ON SARAH, over the gun barrel, her eyes go wide.  We hold
        a BEAT, like a frozen slice of nightmare.

        MEDIUM ON REESE as he whips the riot-gun to a hip-firing posi-
        tion, his overcoat falling back with a snap.  HE FIRES.

        ON TERMINATOR, as the shotgun blast hits his arm and he FIRES,
        simultaneously.  Sarah screams as the .45 round blows stuffing
        out of the booth seat inches from her face.  Her hair is
        singed by burning gunpowder.  An involuntary cry is punched
        out of her by the double concussions.

        Reese is stroking up another shell as Terminator half-rises
        from booth.

        OVER REESE'S SHOULDER, as he fires, cocks the slide, fires
        again, advancing on Sarah's booth.
        Terminator is blown backward over the center divider,
        crashing through the glasses and pitchers of beer on the
        table opposite, and onto the floor.

        Sarah is screaming, scrunched down in the booth.

        Terminator is lying on his back at the feet of a table-
        full of drunk patrons.
        He has two rifled 12 gauge slugs in his chest and one
        in the arm.

        The bar customers are frozen in the weird tableau, cowering,
        gaping.
        Sarah stops screaming.
        Reese stand motionless, gun aimed.
        In the sudden silence, the sound of him cocking the shotgun
        is abnormally loud.

        ON TERMINATOR, very still.
        Then he smoothly rolls to a crouch and slips the UZI machine
        pistol from beneath his overcoat, where it has been hang-
        ing on a shoulder strap.
        He doesn't seem too impaired as he swings around to fire.

        Reese rolls like a cat and comes up firing.
        A burst from the UZI rakes the bar where he stood.
        An orgy of shattering glass.
        Total pandemonium.

        SEVERAL ANGLES  as patrons of the bar run, scream or dive
        for cover, depending upon their level of intelligence.

        Reese slides through the glass to Sarah's booth and seizes
        her wrists.

        ON TERMINATOR, kneeling amid the chaos, raising the UZI
        one-handed.

        Reese tugs viciously on Sarah's arm and she sprawls across
        the booth seat a moment before the divider and seat cushion
        erupt with hits from the UZI.

        ANGLE ON A RUNNING PATRON as a burst of 9mm fire catches
        him in the chest.  He pitches into Sarah's booth, pinning
        her.

        Reese fires, ducks, fires again.
        Tables crash over.
        A window is blown out.
        A table candle rolls into a pool of high-proof alcohol
        behind the bar.
        It ignites with a WHOOSH.

        Reese feed two shells into the riot-gun.

        TIGHT ON TERMINATOR, an island of slow, precise movement
        amid the confusion.  He drops a spent clip.  Reaches for
        another with his bloody hand.

        MOVING WITH REESE as he vaults the row of booths and starts
        firing.  At point blank range he unloads the shotgun into
        Terminator's belly.

        The roaring fire behind the bar is spreading very quickly.
        The air is thick with smoke.
        Reese tosses the UZI, for which he has no ammo, into the
        fire.  He hauls the dead man off Sarah and reaches for her.

        TIGHT ON SARAH, shrinking away from Reese, hysterical.
        When he grabs her wrist she struggles, eyes wide.

        C.U. - REESE, very intense.

                                REESE
                     Come with me if you want
                     to live.

        She looks where he is pointing.

94      EXT. STOKER'S BAR/STREET - NIGHT                       94

        Terminator is rising unsteadily to his feet.  Shattered
        glass rains from him, except where it sticks to his blood-
        drenched shirt and coat.

        C.U. - TERMINATOR, as he slowly look up, his blue eyes
        riveting STRAIGHT INTO THE CAMERA.

        than she could ever imagine as the cold gaze fixes on her.

                                SARAH
                           (awed whisper)

        ging her with him, toward the back.

        REVERSE ON TERMINATOR, DOLLYING as he crashed through the
        wreckage in the swirling smoke, hurling burning tables out
        of his way.

        through the cluttered kitchen, then down a narrow back
        hallway.  Sarah stumbles and Reese brutally pulls her to
        her feet without slowing.

        He hits a closed door, which crashes open.
        Hauls Sarah through, into another corridor.
        Slams and blot-latches it.
        An instant later an impact from the far side tears the
        latch-screws half out of the wall.
        They run on.

        TIGHT ON DOOR at far end.  It splinters open and Terminator

        throttle.  Behind him a fireball of superheated gas hurtles
        down the narrow hallway.  He clears the outer door an
        instant before the tongue of flame roars out into the alley.

        Vukovich's plain car arrives, slewing to a stop in the
        glass-littered street in front of the blazing building.
        He leaps out, Traxler right in behind him.

                                VUKOVICH
                           (shouting)
                     What the fuck is going on?

        TWO LAPD UNITS arrive behind them.  He motions to the
        nearest one.

                                VUKOVICH
                           (continuing)

        dark alley.  Sarah stumbles over trashcans.
        Reese pulls her along mercilessly.

        WHIP-PANNING as they clear a corner.
        The B.G. is a blur.
        The night-maze is a blur in all of these shots.
        No static angles.
        Relentless forward motion.

        bounding like a panther, leaping trash cans and other
        obstacles.

        TRACKING C.U. - TERMINATOR, catching the faintest glimpse
        of a red glow in the pupils of his eyes as he passes through
        total shadow.

106/FX  EXT. ALLEY/POV - TERMINATOR (HANDHELD) - NIGHT         106/FX

        We know this is Terminator's POV because Sarah and Reese
        are just ahead of us.  But the image is bizarre, alien.
        Bright and hyper-real.  There is a hint of digitization,
        and the fleeing figures ahead are more luminous than the
        background, suggesting infra-red.
        The margins of the FRAME are crammed with columns of CRT-
        type characters: columns of numbers and acronyms.  The
        data changes more rapidly than any human eye could follow.
        There is no doubt that we are seeing as a machine would see.
        The sound effects are bright and clear, as if they are
        digitized and enhanced as well.

107     EXT. ADJOINING ALLEY - NIGHT                           107

        Reese and Sarah turn a corner by caroming off the wall
        without slowing and pelt down a narrower alley.  This
        one is lined with a row of parked cars and connects to
        the street.  There is little room to run.
        Reese is reloading on the run, dropping shells.

        Behind them Terminator enters the alley, gaining.

        LOW ANGLE, FAST PANAGLIDE ahead of the fleeing pair.
        As they breast the last car Reese shoves Sarah hard,
        pitching her on her face to the pavement.
        He flings open the car door...a shield.
        Drops to the ground.
        Fires into the gas tank of a car further back in the row
        just before Terminator reaches it.

        The car EXPLODES, filling the alley with fire.  An inferno
        funneled between the enclosing walls.

        ANGLE ON REESE AND SARAH behind the car door as flames
        roar over the hood.

        ON TERMINATOR, as he slides to a stop, cut off by the
        wall of flame.

        Reese doesn't waste any time stuffing Sarah into the car.
        Climbing in after and over her he twists two wires together
        and we recognize it as his stolen GREY SEDAN.
        The engine catches.

        A SILHOUETTE rockets out of the flames.
        Terminator, leaping from the roof of the blazing car ahead,
        impacts on the hood of Reese's car.  His hair and coat are
        burning.

        Reese jams reverse and nail the throttle.
        The car backs down the alley.
        Terminator draws back his fist.
        Punches into the windshield.
        Inside, Sarah is sprayed with glass as the killer's fist
        shoots through.
        The lacerated fingers grope for her.

        WIDE as the car shoots backwards out of the alley onto the
        street, narrowly missing an arriving LAPD CRUISER.

        Sarah plasters herself tightly into the seat as the
        fingers grasp her blouse and pull.
        Reese cranks the wheel hard.

        The sedan skids, slewing sideways into a parked car.

        Terminator rolls down off onto the pavement.
        Reese's car shoots forward.

        PANNING WITH SEDAN as it roars past Vukovich, the gathering
        minions of the burning building, an arriving fire
        truck...shoots through a red light and continues to accel-
        erate.

        Terminator gets to a kneeling position, then slowly stands.
        He pats out his smoldering clothing as he watches his quarry
        escape.

        LOW WIDE ANGLE on the empty street, which is narrow and
        tightly lines with parked cars.
        The ROAR of an engine builds.
        The sedan, like a night-demon, hurtles out of the shadows
        with its lights off, doing ninety plus.

        Paralyzed.  Face bloodless.
        She is shivering silently, uncontrollably.
        Her eyes are wide, and it seems likely that she doesn't
        quite comprehend the roaring blur outside her window.

        around a corner in an expertly controlled slide.
        Then a high speed sprint down the cross-street.
        Reese squirrels the vehicle between a slow-moving car

        Reese drives with total, nerveless absorption.  His eyes
        flick to the mirror, to the road, over his shoulder, back
        ...and the world spins outside.
        With occasional glances to Sarah, he speaks to her in a
        clipped, military voice.

                                REESE
                     Are you injured?  Are you
                     shot?

        No response.
        He reaches over and runs his hands over her arms, legs,
        chest.  Sarah flinches.
        She feels the BLIND PANIC BOILING UP WITHIN HER.
        She pushes his hand away and opens the door.
        Reese slams her back in the seat and slaps her.  Hard.

                     you understand?

        As he speaks he is locking the door and fastening Sarah's
        seatbelt over her, cinching it very tightly, like you would
        for a child.  She doesn't answer.

        Sarah stares numbly at his outstretched hand.  With zero
        strength she automatically returns his handshake.

        The walls of a narrow alley, inky black, frame a police
        cruiser parked on the street beyond.  Firelight from the
        back of Stoker's lights the street garishly.
        A young cop  stands beside the car talking via radio with
        the mike cord pulled through the side window.  He speaks
        with a distinctive twang--a displaced southerner.

        The sweeping headlights of a turning car momentarily illuminate
        the face of Terminator, motionless in the dark right in
        front of us.
        Eyes open.  Listening.

                      round to this side.

        Terminator's silhouette emerges from the blackness and
        strides purposefully toward the cop, CAMERA following.

        The officer whirls and reaches for his gun but Terminator
        flings him brutally into the side of the car, steps over
        him and opens the door.
        Before getting in he notes the unit number on the roof: 143.
        Then he slides behind the wheel, slips the squad car into
        gear, and pulls out.

        Sarah is slumped way down in the seat, turned away from the
        window, trying not to see the landscape reeling outside.

        His grip doesn't slacken.
        Slowly, without releasing her, he reaches across with his
        other hand and shuts the door.  His face shows no reaction.

        Sarah draws back and stares at the blood running down his
        arm from the bite, that at his grim, scarred face.  The
        light turns green and Reese drives on.
        Sarah tastes blood and wipes her mouth.

        Reese's car turns into the parking lot of a large hospital,
        acres of pavement dotted with sporadic parked cars.

        and forth.  DOWN ANGLE, past the chopper, as the circle of
        light moves across a row of parked cars.
        It passes a grey sedan with a shattered windshield.
        Flicks back.  Holds.

        TIGHTER ON CAR, GROUND LEVEL, in the glare and propwash.
        It looks empty.

        behind a row of parked cars.

        He has firm hold of her arm but she seems to be cooperating.
        In the B.G., the chopper hovers, on the far side of the lot.
        Reese approaches the door of a late model brown Buick which
        has been left with its window partway down.
        He unlocks it and they slip inside.

        and roars off in the opposite direction.

134     INT./EXT. BROWN BUICK/PARKING LOT - NIGHT              134

        Reese uses the butt of the shotgun to smash loose the
        ignition assembly.  He begins working on the wires.  A
        police cruiser appears, moving slowly between the rows of
        cars.

        Reese grabs Sarah and pulls her down to huddle below dash
        level.  A moment later a spotlight flashes across the seats
        above them.  They hear the helicopter circling closer.

                                SARAH
                      Reese...why me?  Why does
                      it want me?

        They are lying very close, a forced intimacy.  Reese's voice
        is an urgent whisper, almost in her ear.  A cruiser passes
        so close they can hear its radio clearly.

                                REESE
                      There's so much...

                      Tell me.  Just start at the
                      beginning.

        Reese musters his thoughts.  And starts.

                      There was a war.  A few years

                      whole thing.  All this--

                      started it.

                      It was the machines.

                      other side.  Decided out fate in a
                      microsecond...extermination.

        Reese pauses, and when he continues it's less like a military
        briefing, quieter.

        He pushes up the sleeve of his jacket and shows
        her a ten digit number etches on the skin of his forearm.
        Beneath the numbers is a pattern of lines like the auto-
        matic-pricing marks on product packages.

                      forever...

        The helicopter moves overhead.  Its searchlight illum-
        inates the car interior, moves on.  Before the rotor
        sound fads, Reese starts the car.

        Reese sees the other's shotgun leveled.
        He ducks, steering blind, keeps it floored.
        The windshield and side window EXPLODES INWARD.

        The Buick slams into the black-and-white, spinning it into

        heading for the exit.

        SEVERAL ANGLES, as the police react.

        The chopper banks tight and dives across the tops of

        Engines roar as the cars go flat out.  Buildings lining

        Legitimate police, lights blazing, enter the pursuit

        Sarah, huddles in a blanket, is siting on a bench opposite
        Vukovich's desk.  Motionless.  Her eyes are fixed on the
        middle distance.  She's been crying.  Now she's emptied out.

        The door opens.
        At the sound of the latch Sarah jerks as if struck, and cringes
        involuntarily.  Vukovich enters with Traxler and DR. PETER
        SILBERMAN, a criminal psychologist.  Silberman is smooth
        of skin and manner, young, ambitious and...fat.  He is
        enthusiastic about the workings of the human psyche, as
        emotionally involved as someone pulling the wings off a fly.

        Vukovich sits beside Sarah and hands her a cup of coffee.
        He puts a paternal arm around her shoulders.

        The room costs five dollars a night and that's steep, but
        the FIRE ESCAPE outside the window adds an element of
        strategic value.
        A silhouette slips in through the window and click on the
        single BARE LIGHT BULB.
        It's Terminator, and he's a mess.
        A bloody scarecrow with bullet wounds in stomach, chest,
        shoulder and right wrist.

        MEDIUM ON TERMINATOR as he sits at a ratty folding table
        under the light.
        His eyebrows are singed off.
        Hair a charred stubble.
        Left eyes glistening with imbedded glass shards.

        Before him on the table is an array of SMALL TOOLS.
        He removes the charred remains of his jacket and props.
        one elbow on the table.

        ANGLE PAST HIS NON-FUNCTIONAL RIGHT ARM, F.G., as he exam-
        ines it.  He picks up an X-ACTO KNIFE and cuts deeply into
        the skin of his forearm.
        His expression is one of mild concentration.

        E.C.U. - FOREARM, as he pulls back a large flap of skin to
        reveal a complex trunk of SHEATHED CABLES AND HYDRAULICS.
        They slide as he moves his fingers.

        RESUME MEDIUM, as Terminator uses a rag to wipe away the
        blood.  With small screwdrivers he begins to patiently dis-
        assemble the damaged mechanism around the 12-guage hit.

                           (turning)
                      So Reese is crazy.

                      In technical terminology,
                      he's a loon.

                      But...

        Vukovich hands her something that looks like umpire's
        padding.

                                VUKOVICH
                      Sarah, this is body armor.
                      Out TAC guys wear it.  It'll
                      stop a 12 gauge round.  This
                      other individual must've had
                      one under his coat.

        Sarah want to believe him.  God help her if he's wrong.

                                SARAH
                      But what about him punching
                      through the windshield?

                           (shrugs)
                      Probably on PCP, broke every
                      bone in his hand and won't feel
                      it for hours.  There was this
                      guy once that...

        Vukovich cuts him off with a gesture and sits beside Sarah
        on the bench.

                                VUKOVICH
                      Why don't you just stretch out
                      here and get some sleep.  It'll
                      take your mom a good hour to get
                      here from Redlands.

                                SARAH
                      I can't sleep.

                                VUKOVICH
                      Go ahead.  You're safe.  There're
                      thirty cops in this building.

                                SARAH
                      Okay.

        She lays her head on a wadded up blanket as everyone

        Silberman can be seen through a glass partition next to
        the bullet-proof glass booth enclosing the NIGHT DESK
        SERGEANT'S counter.  The Sergeant hits a button and there
        is a loud BULL-CLACK.  The electric bolt on the security
        door opens and Silberman steps out.

        As he exits the station, he passes Terminator just coming in
        the front door.  He glances at the pale apparition in cap
        and dark wrap-arounds, but goes on.
        Terminator approaches the Desk Sergeant who barely glances
        up when he speaks.

                                TERMINATOR
                      I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.
                      I was told she is here.  Can
                      I see her, please?

                                SERGEANT
                      You can't see here.  She's
                      making a statement.

                                TERMINATOR
                      Where is she?

                      Look.  It's gonna be a while.
                      You wanna wait.  There's a
                      bench.

        Terminator steps back, scanning the booth, the electric
        door, the rooms beyond.

                                TERMINATOR
                      I'll come back.

        He turns and walks out through the front doors.

        ANGLE PAST DESK SERGEANT, F.G. - ON FRONT DOORS, the officer
        is absorbed in paperwork, not watching as a pair of lights
        get BRIGHTER outside the doors.  RAPIDLY.  He glances up
        at the last second as the glare falls fully on him.  CRASH!
        Several cops and late night loiterers scatter as a car
        smashes into the foyer.  It blasts through the sergeant's
        booth, crushing him in the wreckage.

        Leaps to the corridor floor in a shower of plaster fragments.
        He brandishes the AR-180 like a pistol in one hand, the

        trundles down crashing through the underbrush to dis-
        appear among the trees.

        Reese looks out across the valley and the lights of L.A.
        A helicopter circles in the distance, searchlight on.

                                REESE
                     Let's get off the road.

                                               CUT TO:


182     INT./EXT. DRAINAGE CULVERT - NIGHT                     182

        ANGLE LOOKING OUT from the mouth of an enclosed concrete
        storm drain that passes under the road.  Reese, followed
        by Sarah, trudges down the slope and ducks inside.
        The floor is wet but he doesn't seem to mind.
        They both hunker down with their backs to the concrete,
        facing each other.
        They look beaten, grimy, exhausted.
        She huddles under the blanket, waif-like.

                                REESE
                      You cold?

                                SARAH
                      Freezing.

                                REESE
                      Come here.

        She sits beside him and they wrap their arms around each
        other with the blanket covering both of them.

                                SARAH
                      Reese...you got a first name?

                                REESE
                      Kyle.

                                SARAH
                      Kyle, what's it like when you
                      go through time?

                                REESE
                      White light.  Pain.  Like
                      being ripped inside out...
                      slowly.  Like being born,
                      maybe.

        Sarah scowls and draws her hand out from under his jacket.

                                SARAH
                      You're wet.  Oh my god.

        In the beam of the flashlight her hand is glistening
        with blood.

                                REESE
                      I caught one, back there.

                                SARAH
                           (incredulous)
                      Caught one?  You mean you
                      got shot?

        Reese shrugs.

                                REESE
                      It's not bad.

        Sarah sits up and turns toward him.

                                SARAH
                      We gotta get you to a doctor.

                                REESE
                      It's okay.  Forget it.

                                SARAH
                      Forget it?  Are you crazy?
                      Let me see it.

        Sarah opens his jacket and the flashlight beam shows his
        shirt bloodsoaked at the shoulder.

                                SARAH
                           (continuing)
                      Jeez.  You idiot.  Take
                      this off.

        She cradles the flashlight between her knees and opens
        the first aid kit as he removes his jacket.

                                REESE
                           (looking at the
                           wound)
                      See.  Missed everything.
                      Passed through the meat.

        Sarah starts swabbing the flesh wound.

                                SARAH
                      This is gonna make me puke.
                      Talk about something.

                                REESE
                      What?

                                SARAH
                      Just talk.  Tell me about
                      my son.  Is he tall?

        She places a gauze pad in place and starts to wrap it.

                                REESE
                      About my height.  He
                      has your--
                           (winces)
                      ...damn...he has your
                      eyes.

        Sarah glances at his face for a second and then goes back
        to work.

                                SARAH
                      What's he like?

                                REESE
                           (thoughtful)
                      You trust him.  He's got that
                      strength.  You'd die in a
                      second for John.

                                SARAH
                      Well, at least I know what
                      to name him.  I don't suppose
                      you'd know who the father is?
                      So I don't tell him to get
                      lost when I meet him.

                                REESE
                      John never said much about
                      him.  He dies.  Even before
                      the war...

                                SARAH
                           (interrupting)
                      Stop!  I don't want to know.
                      Hold still.  So...it was John
                      that ordered you here?

                                REESE
                      I volunteered.

                                SARAH
                      You volunteered?

                                REESE
                      It was an honor.  A chance
                      to meet the legend.  Sarah
                      Connor.  Who taught her son
                      to fight...organize, prepare.
                      From when he was a kid.  When
                      you were in hiding, before
                      the war.

        She stops taping.  She seems lost, her bravado dissipated.

                                SARAH
                      You talk about things I haven't
                      done yet in the past tense.  It's
                      making me crazy.  I can't think.
                           (pause)
                      Are you sure you've got the
                      right person?

        Reese appraises her coldly.

                                REESE
                      I'm sure.

                                SARAH
                      Come on, me? The mother
                      of the future?  Am I tough?
                      Organized?  I can't even balance
                      my checkbook.  I cry when I see
                      a cat that's been run over...
                      and I don't even like cats.

        She pulls the bandage tight with a knot.

                                REESE
                      Ow!  No, it's okay.  It's
                      better tight.

                                SARAH
                      And anyway, what do I know
                      about guerrilla warfare?

                                REESE
                      You'll learn.

                                SARAH
                           (angry)
                      Look, Reese, I didn't ask for
                      this honor and I don't want it.
                      Any of it.

                                REESE
                      John gave me a message for
                      you.  Made me memorize it.
                      'Sarah"...this is the message...
                      'Sarah, thank you.  For your
                      courage through the dark years.
                      I can't help you with what you
                      must soon face, except to tell
                      you that the future is not set...
                      there is no such thing as Fate,
                      but what we make for ourselves
                      by our own will.  You must be
                      stronger than you imagine you
                      can be.  You must survive, or I
                      will never exist.'  That's all.

        Sarah stares at him as the enormity of it all becomes real
        to her.  Reese moves his arm, testing the bandage.

                                REESE
                           (continuing)
                      Good field-dressing.

                                SARAH
                           (brightening)
                      You like it?  It's my first.

        He rebuttons his shirt and they return to the warmth-
        conserving embrace.  Sarah gazes out the entrance, into
        the night.

                                REESE
                      Sleep.  It'll be light soon.

                                SARAH
                           (closing her
                           eyes)
                      Okay.  Talk some more.

                                REESE
                      About what?

                                SARAH
                           (murmuring)
                      About where you're from.

        Kyle watches the helicopter circling far in the distance.

                                REESE
                      Alright.
                           (pause)
                      You stay down by day, but at
                      night you can move around.
                      The H-K's use infra-red so you
                      still have to watch out.
                      But they're not too bright.
                      John taught us ways to dust them
                      them.  That's when the infiltra-
                      tors started to appear.  The
                      Terminators were the newest,
                      the worst...

        During his monologue we have PANNED into the darkness outside
        and to the helicopter, which flies OUT OF FRAME, leaving
        black.  A ROTOR ROAR fades up.

                                               CUT IN BLACK TO:


183/FX  EXT. CITY RUINS, 2029 - NIGHT                          183/FX

        Black sky.  Stars.
        With a roar an AERIAL PATROL CRAFT enters close overhead.
        It has flashing red and blue lights and powerful search-
        lights which stab down.

        TILT DOWN

        to a vista of moonlit devastation.
        White ash blows in drifts among fire-gutted ruins.
        Blackened bones lie everywhere in heaps.
        Searchlights sweep the night.
        Another aerial unit hovers several blocks away, firing
        tracers into the ruins.

        LOW ANGLE

        as a gleaming chrome H-K grinds through the debris of the
        shattered street on its tank-like tracks, crushing burnt
        skulls.
        Its head turns slowly, playing high-intensity lights over the
        buildings.
        Its hydraulic arms are folded, mantis-like, against its
        'torso'.  After it passes a number of human figures dart
        from shadow to shadow, B.G.

        Reese is among a SQUAD OF MEN in black fatigues, carrying
        equipment and energy rifles, who enter a debris-littered
        tunnel.

        PANAGLIDE WITH THEM as they trot through a labyrinth of
        tunnels, pass several guard-posts.  Reese has a GERMAN
        SHEPHERD on a short leash.

                                               CUT TO:


186     INT. PARKING STRUCTURE - NIGHT                         186

        The platoon enters a cavernous chamber, an old parking
        structure, in which a large group is gathering.
        As the entrance, ARMED SENTRIES with dogs are passing in
        new arrivals: men wearing mismatched uniforms or rags and
        carrying all types of weapons from lasers to shotguns.
        Weapons are left at the sentry post.

        FOLLOWING REESE as he patrols the perimeter.
        He walks along a row of CARS, models from the eighties and
        nineties, now stripped, rusty and modified to carry weapons.
        There are conventional military vehicles as well.
        He passes several family groups.
        Gaunt kids are huddles around an old TV SET.
        Its glow bathes them.

        REVERSE ANGLE reveals that the set has been gutted and a
        small cookfire crackles inside the shell.
        Nearby a kid has a LARGE RAT cornered and is whacking it
        with a stick.

        Reese pauses at the end of the row of vehicles and unsnaps
        a pocket in his tunic, removing a small paper rectangle,
        a worn photograph.

        C.U. - REESE, gazing down.  His head snaps around at the
        sudden sound of BARKING.

        ANGLE ON SENTRY POST as the dogs go crazy.

                                SENTRY
                           (shouting)
                      Terminator!

        An innocuous, RAG-DRESSED MAN flips back his poncho to
        reveal a powerful PLASMA-RIFLE.  He opens FIRE, running
        forward.  ENERGY BOLTS rip into the crowd.

        MOVING WITH REESE, running toward the Terminator.

        RAPID CUTS:

        POWERBOLTS EXPLODE among the fleeing people.
        Beams sear the darkness.
        A running CHILD is BURST by a plasma hit.

        ANGLE ON REESE running.  He levels his energy-rifle and
        starts firing.  A powerbolt grazes his cheek, EXPLODING
        a support column behind him.  Part of the ROOF COLLAPSES
        as Reese tumbles.

        Everything is lit as if by lightning.

        C.U. - REESE, semi-conscious.  Burned.  Bleeding.
        Impressions implode on him: running feet, flashes, energy
        beams raking the ground leaving molten worm-tracks, scream-
        ing, a burning dog howling.

        DETAIL - The picture Reese has been looking at has fallen,
        forgotten.  It catches fire and starts to curl.  Before
        the image vanishes we see that it is a picture of Sarah.

        Reese looks up.
        A figure looms above, a silhouette in the smoky, hellish
        glare.  THE TERMINATOR.  Its  eyes glow red.

        A brilliant EXPLOSION WHITES OUT THE SCREEN.

                                               CUT TO:


187     INT. CULVERT - DAWN                                    187

        C.U. - SARAH, brightly lit by daylight.  Asleep.  She grimaces
        and groans.
        In the distance a dog is barking.

        Reese, still holding her, lightly lifts her hair from her
        face.  An uncharacteristically tender gesture.  He gently
        caresses her cheek with the backs of his fingers.  When
        she awakens suddenly he snaps his hand away.

        Sarah looks around, momentarily disoriented.  Looks up at
        Reese.

                                SARAH
                      I was dreaming about dogs.

        Reese extricates himself from her and steps out of the
        culvert.

                                REESE
                      We used them to spot Terminators.

        Sarah groans as she straightens her legs.

                                SARAH
                      Your world...it's pretty
                      terrifying.

        Sarah catches up to him just as he is about to try and
        stop an approaching car.  She pulls his gun hand down with
        both of hers.

                                SARAH
                      Put that away.  I'll get one.

        She hold out her thumb to passing traffic.
        Reese watches this incomprehensible ceremony skeptically.

                                SARAH
                           (continuing)

        Reese and Sarah are crammed into the cab of a beat-to-hell
        PICKUP TRUCK with the DRIVER, obviously a surfer.  Laid-
        back, long-haired and well-tanned.
        Reese glowers and watches the scenery through slitted eyes.

                                DRIVER
                      ...and when it breaks right

190     EXT. SERVICE STATION - DAY                             190

        The gas station is like an oasis of clutter in a rolling
        stretch of meadows and woods.  It consists of a bunker-
        like building with restrooms and a flanking PICNIC AREA,
        beyond which are WOODS.
        People sit under the trees, enjoying the beautiful day
        while children tear around after the forced inactivity of
        a long trip.

        The three of them get out on unsteady legs.

                                SARAH

                      Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.

        She heads for the WOMEN'S RESTROOM and Kyle follows her
        inside.

                                REESE
                           (pushing him out)
                      Yours is over there.

        Instead of following her directions to the Men's Room,
        Kyle wanders toward the drinking fountain.  A bunch of
        kids are running around and throwing water at each other
        with paper cups.

        Reese shambles through them like a zombie.
        He stands among the children, an alien in this land without
        fear.  He watches people at picnic tables laughing and
        listening to portable music.  Kids squeal.  Dogs bark.

                                LITTLE GIRL (V.O.)
                      Can you get my balloon?

        DOWN ANGLE on an achingly beautiful LITTLE GIRL of about
        four.  She points above his head.

        Reese looks up to see a helium-filled mylar balloon stuck in
        the foliage of a tree just above him.  He pulls it down by
        the string and holds it, turning it over dully.

        He crouches down to her eye-level.  She smiles.

                                REESE
                      Aren't you afraid to be out in

                                LITTLE GIRL
                      Huh?

        Reese whirls reflexively at a SCREAM behind him.  The
        mylar balloon bursts in his tense hands.  A teenage girl
        is being doused with water by the boys with plastic jugs.

        The little girl looks at the broken balloon, then glares
        at Reese.  She punches him soundly on the shoulder and
        storms off.

        At this moment she is bowled over by an IRISH SETTER that
        licks her face while she shrieks with laughter.
        Reese seems about to smile but doesn't quite know how to
        go about it.

        Sarah has been idly leafing through the DIRECTORY.  On
        a whim she looks up something.
        She freezes for a moment when she finds the listing.
        Then with a triumphant expression she rips the page out
        of the book.

        It reads:

        Only a few yards from the picnic area, the woods take over
        completely.

        PANNING WITH SARAH

        as she runs down the path.
        Reese tackles her from behind and they fall together in
        the long spring grass.
        She struggles violently to get away.

                                SARAH
                      Let...go...bastard...

        She gets one arm free and whacks him hard in the face.
        Reese reacts instinctively, leaping back in a defensive
        crouch.  Sarah freezes when she sees the .357 in his
        hand.

                      brilliant.

        Reese is trembling as he lowers the gun.
        Sarah too is shaking with emotion.  Tears roll down her
        cheeks and her voice cracks.

        He straightens up and his arms go limp at his sides.
        He turns away.

        Reese doesn't respond.
        The gun slips from his fingers.
        His will seems to drain from him and he sags to his knees.
        The moment stretches.
        There is only the sunlight moving in shafts through the
        leaves, the sound of a small stream nearby, birds chirping.

                                SARAH

        She crawls over to him.

        Sarah puts her arm around him.
        She sniffs and wipes at her nose with the back of her hand.

                      We can change it, Kyle.  We
                      have to try.

        She takes his shoulder in her hands.

        A patch of SCALP is blown away, revealing CHROME underneath.
        A flap of skin dangles from his cheek, which exposes some
        of the DRIVE CABLES which move the lips.
        He is scanning Sarah's address book, turning a page every
        two seconds.

        C.U. - TERMINATOR

        his eyes tracking rapidly.  His skin is waxy, WHITE, BRUISED,
        GANGRENOUS in places.  He ignores the FEW FLIES crawling
        on his face.

        Sarah turns to wave as a TRACTOR-TRAILER pulls away noisily,
        heading back to the Interstate.  The driver answers her wave
        out the side window.  Reese stops for a moment outside the
        motel office to pet a GERMAN SHEPHERD sitting on the porch.
        The dog wags its tail and licks his hand.

        Reese opens the door and they go in.

        She takes it without thinking as he leaves then realizes
        that she has A LOADED GUN IN HER HAND, without the slightest
        idea of how to use it.  She lays it gently on the dresser.
        As an afterthought, she turns it with one finger so that it
        is pointing the other way.

        out for her hand and it seems he may be taking it to
        comfort her.

                                REESE
                      Probably.  Sarah, if I get
                      zeroed...

                                SARAH
                      Don't say that.

                                REESE
                      If I do, you have to get away,
                      disappear without a trace.
                      Different country, different
                      name, everything.  In case they
                      send another one.

                                SARAH
                      It'll never be over, will it?
                      Look at me, I'm shaking.
                      Some legend, huh?  You must
                      be pretty disappointed.

                                REESE
                      No.  I'm not.

        Several beats before Sarah speaks again.  Her eyes seem
        luminous in the dark.

                                SARAH
                           (softly)
                      Kyle, the women in your
                      time...what were they like?

                                REESE
                      Good fighters.

                                SARAH
                      That's not what I meant.
                      Was there someone special?

                                REESE
                      Someone?

                                SARAH
                      A girl.  You know.

                                REESE
                           (mechanically)
                      No.
                           (pause)
                      Never.

        He looks away, outside the window

                                SARAH
                           (softly)
                      I'm sorry.

        Sarah studies him for a moment.
        She's sitting slightly behind him and she puts her hands
        on his shoulders and back, tracing the lines of his scars
        with her fingertips.

                                SARAH
                      So much pain.

                                REESE
                      Pain can be controlled.
                      You disconnect it.

                                SARAH
                      And so you feel nothing.

                                REESE
                      It's better that way.

                                SARAH
                           (with great
                           sympathy)
                      Oh, Kyle.

        Reese takes a long, slow breath before he answers, and when
        he does his voice has a new quality, an unfamiliar tenderness.

                                REESE
                      John Connor gave me a picture
                      of you once.  I never knew
                      why.  It was very old. Torn.
                      Faded.  You were young, like
                      you are now.  You weren't
                      smiling...just a little sad...
                      I always wondered what you
                      were thinking at that second.

        He closes his eyes, reaches toward her.  His fingertips
        trace the contour of her nose, chin, cheeks.

                                REESE
                           (continuing)
                      I memorized every line, every
                      curve...

        He opens his eyes, looking right at hers.

                                REESE
                           (continuing)
                      Sarah, I came across time
                      for you.  I love you.
                      I always have.

        Sarah is quietly overwhelmed.
        Reese looks away.

                                REESE
                           (continuing)
                      I'm sorry.  I shouldn't
                      have said...

                                SARAH
                      Kyle...


        She leans forward and kisses him.
        His face is frozen.  A mask.
        She continues, tenderly.
        He begins to respond.
        The dam breaks and he holds her in a tight, trembling
        embrace, clinging to her like life itself.

        Kyle picks her up and carries her to the bed.
        She kisses his neck and chest, tracing his scars with
        her lips.

        He unbuttons her blouse very slowly.
        Sarah guides his powerful hands over her.

        A SEQUENCE OF CUTS.  DETAILS.  IMPRESSIONS.

        Sarah, a very close angle, as she grimaces in divine agony.
        Reese, his face rapt.
        His hand, clutching the pillow as if to kill it.
        It is explosive, torrential.  A confluence of fate and will.

        TIGHT ON SARAH AND REESE in each other's arms.  Lying
        across his chest, she surveys his face as his eyes close
        drowsily.

                                SARAH
                      I bet you're ticklish.

                           hending)
                      Ticklish?

        Sarah's hand moves OUT OF FRAME.  After a moment Reese
        looks down, puzzled.

                                REESE
                      What are you doing?

                                SARAH
                           (continuing
                           doggedly)
                      You'll beg for mercy in
                      a second.

        Reese seems unperturbed.  Finally he begins to squirm.

                                REESE
                      I don't think I like this.

                                SARAH
                      You're not supposed to.

        Now Reese is becoming desperate.  A grimace spreads across
        his face.  It becomes a grin.  Then he's laughing, trying
        to escape but she won't let him, and they collapse, laughing
        together.
        Sarah gazes at his grin, a glimpse of the Reese that might
        have been, in another life.

        A moment later the grin vanishes at the sound of dogs barking
        outside.
        Reese is off the bed in an instant, crouched tense, eyes
        alert.  Feral as ever.

                                REESE
                           (whispering)

        The digitized view is image-intensified, bright and stark
        as a lunar landscape.  PAN OFF the lunging dog to the row
        of rooms facing the parking lot.

        HANDHELD as we approach the doors.
        It is WIDE ANGLE and the barrel of the AR-180 is visible at
        the bottom of FRAME.
        The nearest vehicle parked in front is a LARGE PICKUP TRUCK
        WITH TWO DIRT BIKES lashed in the bed, seen prominently as
        we pass.

        The POV approaches a door.  Number 14.

        The door is KICKED OPEN.
        Moving inside.
        The assault rifle sprays the room, exploding the indistinct
        forms on the bed.  Staccato glare.  Approaching the bed.
        Nothing there put the shredded remain of sheets and pillows.

        The POV shifts to the BACK DOOR, which is ajar, and moves
        toward it.  Through the door.  Revealing an EMPTY YARD.

        Reese is under the dash, playing with the wires.
        Sarah lies on the seat, clutching the nylon satchel, which
        bulges with the explosive charges.  She has dressed hastily
        and is barefoot.

                                REESE
                      Light it now.

        Sarah has been holding a BIC LIGHTER near the tip of a fuse.
        She thumbs the flame on.  The fuse catches as Reese twists
        the wires and the engine starts to turn over.

        FAST PANAGLIDE WITH HIM as he runs the
        length of the suite, stops outside the front door.
        Whips the AR to his shoulder.

        The truck is BACKING WILDLY across the lot B.G.
        Terminator turns, looking into CAMERA as a SIZZLING SOUND
        becomes audible.

        DETAIL - PIPE CHARGE, lying just inside the door, in the
        shadows.  The fuse is burning.

        WIDE SHOT - On doorway, from the parking lot, as Terminator
        takes two leaping strides forward and the CHARGE EXPLODES.
        The front of the building is BLOWN TO KINDLING.
        Terminator is flung forward by the blast.

        from the blast settles.  A YOUNG GUY ON A HONDA 750 crosses
        the parking lot and stops near him, running forward.
        Terminator starts to get up, moving slowly.

        18-wheelers.  The truck tops out at 110 and he holds it.
        They flicker rapidly through pools of light and shadow.

        ANGLE OVER REESE'S SHOULDER as they hurtle forward.  An
        interchange flashes by in an instant.

        PACING WITH THE TRUCK, looking back as a single headlight
        arcs radically across all lanes behind them and grows

        tucked, getting as much speed as possible out of the 750.

        assault rifle.  Raises it against the windstream in a one-

        he checks the load.  Snaps the cylinder shut.  Glances in
        the rear mirror.  Turns the wheel.

        the pickup, B.G.  The truck swerves suddenly, diving around
        a TRACTOR-TRAILER.  Terminator leans hard to follow.

        LOW WIDE ANGLE preceding the pickup and Terminator as they
        swerve as high speed.  Reese uses the slow semis as static
        obstacles.  He misses them by inches, TIRES SQUEALING.

        ANGLE OVER SARAH'S SHOULDER, through the front window as
        the back of a SEMI-TRAILER hurtles toward them, straight ahead.

        HIGH ANGLE, following both vehicles as Reese feints RIGHT
        and then skids LEFT.  He slides toward the trailer in a
        FOUR-WHEEL DRIFT as Terminator commits to the right.

        M.C.U. - TERMINATOR, over the barrel of the AR, as he FIRES.

        SIDE ANGLE - PASSING TRUCK-TRAILER, bullets strafe across
        it as the pickup vanishes behind.  Terminator skids the
        bike, barely missing an abutment, and is forced onto an
        OFF-RAMP.

        LOW SIDE ANGLE preceding Terminator as he roars down the
        off-ramp without slowing.  Runs the red light at the bottom
        as a hundred miles an hour.  Climbs the ON-RAMP.

        Terminator appears B.G., converging rapidly as the on-ramp
        joins the freeway.

        handed.  He FIRES.  ONCE.  TWICE.  AGAIN.

        They enter an interchange.  Ahead lies a LONG, SWEEPING
        CURVE, two lanes wide and elevated.

        Terminator rocks back from a round between the eyes that
        bares metal, the FIRES.

        Bullets rake the pickup.
        The windows are blown out.
        The side mirror explodes.
        Reese is hit.  Drops the .357.
        Sarah screams and weaves, barely in control.

        He FIRES.
        Sarah shrieks as the doorpost next to her head CLANGS WITH
        HITS.

        The short burst EMPTIES THE GUN.
        It CLATTERS TO THE PAVEMENT a moment later, discarded.
        Terminator draws the .38.  Takes aim.

        Sarah SCREAMS.  HITS THE BREAKS HARD.  CRANKS THE WHEEL.
        GLASS behind her EXPLODES with gunfire.

        SWERVING VICIOUSLY the truck SLAMS THE BIKE, sending it
        FLYING INTO A GUARDRAIL.  Terminator goes over the handle
        bars at a hundred miles per hour.

        with a CHATTERING SCREECH and spraying sheets of SPARKS
        as flesh strips away and steel screams on concrete.
        The pickup SWAPS ENDS violently, smashing into the guardrail.

        Terminator hits the guardrail, bounces up, tumbles along the
        top and then pitches OUT INTO SPACE.

        him down and under with a METALLIC CRASH.

        ANGLE UNDER TANKER as Terminator rolls, clattering, and the
        mass blurs above him.  He RICOCHETS between the pavement and
        the speeding undercarriage until a stray bounce flings him
        up into the rear suspension.

        hand over hand like a HUMAN FLY, toward CAMERA.  The

        stops beneath him he drops off and rolls out from under
        the truck.

        ripped open.
        Terminator appears.  A grisly apparition.
        FLINGS THE DRIVER OUT and takes his place behind the wheel.
        Ignoring the terrified partner, he examines the controls.

        From the railing Sarah sees the tanker below as

        a body falls beside it, rolling.
        The truck swings in a slow arc.
        TEARS THROUGH THE DIVIDING FENCE.
        Heads back toward her on the wrong side of the freeway.

        She stares in numb horror.
        The nightmare refuses to end.
        She runs to the crippled pickup and sees a front tire flat,
        shredded by a crumpled fender.

        She searches the cab frantically for the KEYS TO THE
        MOTORCYCLES.  Finds them above the sun visor.

        Sarah leaps into the bed of the pickup and attacks the
        motorcycle strap-downs frantically.
        Panting with terror she rolls the bike off the truck.
        It crashes on its side and she falls on it painfully.

        Straining until she CRIES OUT INVOLUNTARILY, she lifts
        it upright.
        KICKS the engine over.

        LOW ANGLE

        as the tanker crashes back through the divider and starts
        UP THE OVERPASS.  Sarah is trapped in that concrete corridor.
        She kicks for her life.
        The bike catches for a moment.  Dies.

        The truck BELLOWS, down-shifting on the curving grade.
        Sarah kicks again and again, crying out with each stroke.
        Again and again, furiously.
        The engine CATCHES.

                                SARAH
                           (rapidly)

                     ...run, you...

        The bike runs with a healthy roar.

        LOW ANGLE

        up the face of the tractor-trailer, the retaining wall blur-
        ring by.  Terminator's red eye can be seen through the wind-
        shield.

        Sarah drags Reese, stumbling,to the bike, props him on the
        seat behind her.  He clutches the satchel weakly.

                                SARAH
                     Hold on real tight, okay?

        She guns the engine and roars off.

        IT OVER THE SIDE LIKE A BEER CAN.

        ANGLE ON TANKER roaring forward, shifting up through
        the gears.

        CLOSE ON SARAH AND KYLE, his head lolling on her shoulder.
        He starts to fall sideways.

        He rouses slightly, gripping her tighter.

        HIGH ANGLE - MOVING WITH BOTH VEHICLES as Sarah starts to
        ZIGZAG desperately across all four lanes.  The truck stays

        back at a SOLID WALL OF METAL AND LIGHTS looming behind them.

        tunnel.  Sarah dodges to one side and LOCKS THE BRAKES.
        The bike slides, fish-tailing.
        The truck roars past, hitting the air-brakes.
        The trailers force her closer and closer  to the guardrail
        as Terminator tries to sandwich her.
        The bike slides to a stop.
        The rearmost set of trailer wheels slams into the guardrail
        right in front of Sarah.

        Sarah emerges from a cloud of tire smoke, cutting across
        all four lances behind the stopped semi.

        the slope.

        MOVING WITH HER as she scrambles, half-dragging Kyle, through
        a row of trees at a chainlink retaining fence.  She crawls
        under the fence, tugs Kyle and the satchel through after.

        Sarah looks up at the source of a SUDDEN THUNDEROUS ROAR.

        LIKE A JUGGERNAUT the truck follows, smashing through parked
        cars and FLATTENING A PRE-FAB STORAGE BUILDING.

        They enter an alley-like space between two buildings.
        Kyle is fumbling to open the satchel.

        ANGLE BACK as the tanker enters the alley.  It TEARS THE

        tank-cylinder of the second trailer.
        He ducks as it rolls on.

        Sarah is stumbling in the glare of the truck's lights.

        E.C.U. - PIPE BOMB, the fuse burning.

        M.C.U. - TERMINATOR, the last flakes of flesh are falling
        from him like burning leaves.  His gleaming structure is
        revealed in all its intricacy.  No longer a 'He', but an 'It'.
        It looks like Death rendered in steel.
        A CHROME SKELETON with HYDRAULIC MUSCLES and TENDONS OF
        FLEXIBLE CABLE.  In the sockets of the metal skull, the
        eyeball swivels with a WHIR of tiny servos, both glowing
        red now.

        It turns slowly and fixes its gaze directly INTO CAMERA.

        PANAGLIDE WITH KYLE AND SARAH as they stagger to their feet
        and run to the nearest building.  They come to a glass door.

        The Terminator BLASTS THE DOOR OFF ITS HINGES, F.G., and

                                SARAH
                           (panting)
                      What are you doing?

                                REESE
                           (weakly)
                      Cover...our footsteps...

        He sags, sliding down the wall.  She pulls him up.
        Half-carries him into the maze of machines.
        The dark gallery is filled with WHIRRING, CLANKING SHAPES,
        SHATTERING CONVEYER BELTS and improbable mechanisms lashing
        mindlessly.

        Reese slips to the floor and Sarah is no longer able to
        support him.

                                REESE
                           (faintly)
                      Leave me here.

        Sarah crouches beside him.
        Grabs his shirt front.
        Yells over the machines.

                                SARAH
                      I'm not leaving you anywhere
                      you jerk.  Haven't you figured
                      it out?  Kyle, John is our
                      son.

        Reese's eyes refocus.

                                SARAH
                           (continuing)
                      There isn't going to be
                      anybody else...I don't want
                      anybody else.  Listen to
                      me!

        She pauses, then resumes in a commanding, military shout.

                                SARAH
                           (continuing)
                      Move!  Reese! Let's go.
                      Move you ass!

        She drags him to his feet and he staggers on.

        Hinges SHATTER and the firedoor is hurled inward.
        The Terminator scans the darkness.

        ANGLE - PANNING WITH SARAH AND KYLE as they move through
        the machines.

        The cyborg steps forward, scanning methodically.

        Sarah and Kyle move in a crouch through the treacherous
        tangle of pipes and machinery.  Kyle picks up a length of
        pipe to use as a weapon.  As they climb out onto a cat-
        walk between the two huge mechanisms, Sarah clambers over
        an innocuous CONTROL PANEL.
        Her knee inadvertently hits a RED PUSH BUTTON.
        With a ROAR the stamping-plate of a HYDRAULIC PRESS slams
        down an inch from her hand.
        Startled, she tumbles to the catwalk.

        The Terminator's eyes swivel as he hears the single non-
        rhythmic sound.

        Kyle and Sarah run to the end of the catwalk, but find the
        door there locked.

                                SARAH
                      Come on!

        They double back to escape the cul-de-sac.  The Terminator
        steps in front of them, cutting them off.

                                REESE
                           (shouting)
                      Run!

        He pushes Sarah roughly and she stumbles away.
        Kyle raises the pipe with his good arm as the Terminator
        advances.

                                REESE
                           (over his
                           shoulder)
                     Run, damn it!

        She hesitates, backing away.
        The cyborg swings at Reese
        STEEL CLANGS ON STEEL.
        Kyle strikes and parries but is sledgehammered back.

        ANGLE ON CATWALK as Kyle lands in a heap, smashed against
        a stanchion of the railing which prevented him falling to
        the factory floor twenty feet below.

        Sarah turns and runs.

        LOW ANGLE PAST REESE, F.G., as the cyborg approaches him.

        E.C.U. - A FUSE BURNING.

        C.U. - KYLE'S FACE streaked with blood, pressed to the
        floor as a metal foot CLANGS DOWN, F.G.   His eyes snap open.

        Sarah falls, gets up, runs on.
        The Terminator draws back for a death blow.
        And Kyle rolls with the last of his strength, raising
        the pipe bomb he has been cradling.  He jams it between two
        hydraulic cylinders just beneath the cyborg's armored  rib-
        cage.  Then rolls off the catwalk.  Terminator has an instant
        to react, reaching for the bomb, before it EXPLODES.

        Sarah is pitched forward by the blast and slides on the
        floor.
        Slams up against one wall.
        A withering spray of shrapnel strafes the walls around her.
        Pieces of scrap metal clatter throughout the factory, rain-
        ing down.

        C.U. - SARAH, very still.  She winces and opens her eyes.
        Slowly looks up.

        POV - SARAH, as the smoke clears.  The Terminator is GONE.
        Unrecognizable clumps of BURNING DEBRIS lie scattered about.
        Looking down through the grating floor she sees Kyle's
        body.
        LOW ANGLE ON KYLE F.G., Sarah on catwalk above.  Kyle's eyes
        are half-open.  Still.  His face peaceful.
        ANGLE ON ONE OF THE FIRES climbing some plastic tubing and
        triggering a SPRINKLER HEAD.  It begins to rain.
        C.U. - SARAH sitting up as the water runs over her.
        She looks down.  Protruding from her right thigh is a TWISTED
        PIECE OF METAL.  Shrapnel.  Part of the cyborg.  She pulls
        it out, grimacing.  Her leg is broken.

        It is a long time before she can gather the will to move.

        SARAH'S POV - She sees a WALL PHONE several yards away,
        beyond the debris from the explosion.
        She starts to crawl toward it.
        She passes A LARGE CLUMP OF DEBRIS, F.G.

        ANGLE ON DEBRIS (FX) as it rolls over suddenly!
        Now recognizable as the TERMINATOR'S HEAD AND ARMS, with
        half of the scattered torso trailing wires and twisted
        metal.

        IT LUNGES FOR HER!

        Sarah wants to scream this time, from the depths of her
        soul, but there is no scream, only a dry shivering sob.

        The Terminator drags itself SCRAPING over the floor, steel
        fingers clutching.

        Sarah is shaking and whimpering as she scrabbles away,
        crawling in agony.

        ANGLE ON CONVEYOR BELT as Sarah flops from the catwalk
        onto the MOVING STRIP.  She is carried into the intricate
        lattice of equipment.  Sarah rolls off weakly before going
        under a set of sorting rollers.

        ANGLE THROUGH MACHINERY - ON THE TERMINATOR (FX) as it crawls
        after her, dragging its body.  It tracks her unerringly,
        EYES GLOWING.

        Sarah moves deeper into the DARK, CLASHING JUNGLE of machinery.
        Around her is a rain-drenched tangle of CABLES, PIPES and
        unforgiving mechanisms of steel.

        The Terminator clambers through after her.

        C.U. - SARAH - Water pours into her eyes as she catches
        sight of something.  A familiar CONTROL BOX.
        She drags herself toward it.

        C.U. - THE TERMINATOR (FX) - It spots her wedged in a tiny
        crawl space.  No way out.

        It crawls the last few feet,EYES RED IN THE DARK.
        Hypnotized, Sarah watches the Terminator REACHING TOWARD HER.
        She is jammed in a corner.
        Sarah's hand claws around to the front of the control panel,
        seeking the RED BUTTON.

        E.C.U. - HER WET FINGERTIPS FEEL THE BUTTON.

        ANGLE ON THE TERMINATOR (FX), his steel hand reaching out.

        E.C.U. - SARAH, her face inexplicably calm, eyes steady in
        that infinite instant.  She clenches her teeth to keep
        from screaming as she WAITS.

        The Terminator's hand reaches for her throat to crush
        the life out of her and end its long mission.

                                SARAH
                           (voice icy)
                      You're...terminated...fucker!

        E.C.U. - BUTTON, as her bloody finger stabs it down.

        FULL SHOT, showing how the cyborg has been led into the
        MAW OF THE HYDRAULIC PRESS.
        THE STAMPING PLATE THUNDERS DOWN!
        Tons of mechanical pressure flatten the Terminator's head
        and body like tin-foil.  The PRESS SCREAMS, jamming solid.
        Lightning snaps out in one brief blaze, leaping to surround-
        ing machinery, arcing to Sarah's wristwatch.  All the
        Terminator's energy is released in one second.

        ANGLE on the narrow gap between the upper and lower plates:
        a pinpoint of red light DWINDLES AND GOES OUT.
        TIGHT ON SARAH, shivering uncontrollably.  The steel fingers
        are frozen an inch from her throat.  She can only stare as
        water runs over her.

                                               CUT TO:


257     INT. FACTORY - DAWN                                    257

        CLOSE ON the side rail of an ambulance gurney SNAPPING UP
        into position.  Sarah's eyes are closed and she is moved
        OUT OF FRAME.

        WIDE SHOT, showing the gurney being rolled by TWO ATTENDANTS
        past the site of the last explosion.
        SEVERAL POLICE OFFICERS are picking through the debris.

        PANNING WITH THE GURNEY as it is wheeled out, holding on
        TWO FACTORY EMPLOYEES, F.G.
        One, the PLANT MANAGER, bends to examine a piece of the
        cyborg lying at the base of the hydraulic press.
        A COP, B.G., notices this.

                                COP
                      Look, I told you not to
                      touch anything until we're
                      done.  You got that?

                                MANAGER
                      Sure thing, officer.

        He stands and palms a small object to HIS ASSISTANT.  They
        step around the corner.

                                ASSISTANT
                      What is it?

                                MANAGER
                      Microcomputer chassis.  But
                      I've never seen stuff like
                      this anywhere.

                                ASSISTANT
                      Weird.  Jap stuff, maybe?

                                MANAGER
                      Keep it out of sight and
                      get it down to R and D
                      Monday, first thing.

                                ASSISTANT
                      Good idea.

                                               CUT TO:


258     EXT. BUILDING - DAWN                                   258

        Sarah is being lifted into the ambulance.  She looks
        up as the doors are latched shut.

        TILT UP to follow her gaze.
        The sign above the entrance of the building reads:

        CYBER DYNAMICS CORPORATION

                                               SLOW DISSOLVE TO:


259     INT./EXT. LANDROVER - LATE AFTERNOON                   259

        MACRO ON CASSETTE RECORDER, the center capstans of a
        tape turning.

                                SARAH (V.O.)
                      ...and the hardest thing is
                      deciding what I should tell
                      you and what not to.  Well,
                      anyway, I've got a while yet
                      before you're old enough to
                      understand the tapes.  They're
                      more for me at this point...
                      to help get it all straight.

        COVER SHOT reveals Sarah as the wheel of a dusty landrover
        parked at the pump island of a tiny gas station.  All of
        its signs are in hand-lettered Spanish.  Beyond lies an
        expanse of scrub desert.  The sky scowls with an impending
        storm.

        Sarah speaks quietly into a hand microphone as a dark-
        complected attendant laconically fills her tank.  She
        cradles the cassette recorder in her lap, in the lee of
        her SWOLLEN BELLY.
        She looks to be about SIX MONTHS ALONG.
        Under her down vest she wears a leather shoulder holster
        and the butt of a .357 REVOLVER presses against her
        breast.  She tugs the vest closed as the attendant glances
        her way.  A German Shepherd sits in the back among taped
        boxes and suitcases.

                                SARAH
                           (continuing)
                      Should I tell you about your
                      father?  That's a tough one.
                      Will it change your decision
                      to send him here...knowing?
                      But if you don't send Kyle,
                      you could never be.  God,
                      you can go crazy thinking
                      about all this...I suppose
                      I'll tell you...I owe him that.
                      And maybe it'll be enough if
                      you know that in the few hours
                      we had together we loved a
                      lifetime's worth...

        CLICK.  WHIR.  Sarah jumps at a sound nearby, breaking
        her reverie.  A small MEXICAN BOY has snapped her picture
        with a beat-up Polaroid camera.  He holds it out to her,
        speaking rapid Spanish.

                                ATTENDANT
                      He says you are very beautiful,
                      Senora, and he is ashamed to ask
                      five American dollars for this
                      picture, but if he does not,
                      his father will beat him.

                                SARAH
                      That's a pretty good hustle,
                      kid.  Four.  Quatro.

        The boy takes her four dollars and she watches the
        snapshot develop.  It is a good photograph of her,
        the wind lightly ruffling her hair, expression thought-
        ful, slightly sad.

        We recognize it as the one Reese carried in 2029.
        She slips it into her short pocket.

                                ATTENDANT
                      Mil trescientos...fifteen dollars
                      American.

        As she pays him, distant thunder rolls.
        The boy yells something in Spanish as he runs off.

                                SARAH
                      What did he say?

                                ATTENDANT
                           (accented)
                      There is a storm coming in.

        Sarah gazes at the thunderheads building up out over the
        desert.  Heat lightning pulses in their depths.

                                SARAH
                           (quietly)
                      I know.

        CAMERA CRANES UP as she pulls away, driving across the
        flat desert on a ribbon of highway.  A brilliant flash
        crescendos from horizon to horizon out at the rim of the
        world.
