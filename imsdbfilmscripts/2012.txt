          OVER BLACK
          
          We listen to the immortal music of Mozart's Adagio of the
          Clarinet Concerto in A.
          
                                                                FADE UP

          Space, infinite and empty.
          
          But then, slowly all nine planets of our Solar System move
          into frame and align.
          
          The last of them is the giant, burning sphere of the sun.
          
          Just as the sun enters frame, a solar storm of gigantic
          proportion unfolds. The eruptions shoot thousands of miles
          into the blackness of space.

          EXT. COUNTRY SIDE/INDIA - SUNSET
          
          Mozart's concerto filters from a jeep's stereo, fighting the
          drumming sounds of the monsoon rain. PROF. FREDERIC WEST, 66,
          listens to the music.
          
          An Indian BOY playing by the roadside steers his wooden toy
          ship across a puddle.
          
          The Professor turns to his driver, pointing to the boy.
          
                                       PROF. WEST
                       Watch out!
          
          But it's too late. The jeep drives straight through the
          puddle at full speed, sinking the boy's toy ship.
          
          In the background, the jeep stops in front of a building. The
          driver jumps out, leading the Professor towards its entrance.
          
          The sign at the door reads: `Institute for Astrophysics -
          University of New Delhi'.
          
                                                                        2.
          
          INT. NAGA-DENG MINE/INDIA - SUNSET
          
          An endless mine shaft. An old elevator cage comes to a
          grinding halt. When Prof. West steps out we see that he is
          accompanied now by a nervous DR. SATNAM TSURUTANI, 32.
          
                                       PROF. WEST
                    How deep are we?
          
                                     SATNAM
                    8200 feet. Used to be an old copper
                    mine, Professor, sir.
          
          As Prof. West follows Satnam, he takes in the unusual setting
          for this science lab.
          
                                     PROF. WEST
                    Helmsley told me that the neutrino
                    count doubled during the last sun
                    eruptions.
          
                                     SATNAM
                    Correct, sir. But that is not what
                    worries me...
          
          They enter a large room with low hanging ceilings. A small
          group of WHITE COATS look up from their computers, which all
          show images of the solar storm we witnessed earlier.
          
                                     SATNAM (CONT'D)
                    There was a new solar storm, so strong
                    that the physical reaction got even
                    more severe.
          
                                       PROF. WEST
                    How can that be?
          
                                     SATNAM
                    We don't know, Professor, sir.
          
          Satnam walks over into another room. There he opens a hatch
          on the floor and hot steam rises.
          
                                     SATNAM (CONT'D)
                    The neutrinos suddenly act like...
                    microwaves.
          
          Prof. West slowly steps closer. When he discovers that the
          water in the tank below is boiling, his face goes pale.
          
                                                                CUT TO:

          EXT. LARGE TERRACE/WASHINGTON D.C. - EVENING
          
          A major fund raising party is under way. The setting is
          spectacular. A terrace overlooking the Washington Mall and
          the Capitol Building.
          
          ADRIAN HELMSLEY, 32, stands with a group of young POLITICAL
          AIDES. He is the only African-American among them.
          
          One of the aides spots CARL ANHEUSER, 58, White House Chief
          of Staff, working the crowd.
          
                                     POLITICAL AID #1
                    Look at Anheuser. Anyone would think he
                    was President. Did you hear, he wants
                    us to sign in and out like school boys?
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    I still can't believe that Wilson chose
                    him of all people to run the White
                    House.
          
                                     POLITICAL AID #2
                    Why not? Anheuser owns the Senate and
                    the Congress.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Shame he's such a pompous ass.
          
                                     ANHEUSER (O.S.)
                    Somebody mention my name?
          
          Adrian turns to see Anheuser smiling.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                            (SHOCKED)
                    Yes sir... No, sir.
          
                                       ANHEUSER
                    Which one is it?
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    We were talking about what a great
                    speech you gave tonight. Well done,
                    sir.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    It's Helmsley, right? I'll remember
                    that.
          
          Anheuser walks away with a dangerous smile.
          
                                     POLITICAL AID #2
                    That guy scares the shit out of me.
          
          At that moment Adrian's cell phone rings.
                                                              (CONTINUED)

                    Professor West?
          
                                     PROF. WEST (O.S.)
                    I've been trying to reach you!
          
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM/SATNAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          Prof. West is on the phone. In the background we make out
          Satnam's family around the dining room table.
          
                                     PROF. WEST
                    Listen, Adrian. The situation is much
                    worse than we thought...
          
          Satnam quiets his little son. It is the boy we saw earlier
          with his toy ship.
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY/WHITE HOUSE - DAY
          
          Adrian follows Anheuser through a hallway of the White House,
          papers in hand.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Sir, the President needs to know this.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    Helmsley, how long have you been on the
                    job as science advisor?
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Four months this week.
          
                                       ANHEUSER
                    I would   say that's enough time to learn
                    that we   have rules here. You'll just
                    have to   wait until the quarterly
                    science   briefing.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    If this is about what I said last
                    night, I am truly sorry, sir.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    So you didn't like my speech?
          
          Exasperated, Adrian holds out the papers to him.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Can you please have a look at this,
                    sir? It's really important.
          
          
                                                                (CONTINUED)

          Finally, Anheuser rips the papers out of his hands and starts
          to walk away, reading.
          
          Suddenly he slows down.
          
                                      ANHEUSER
                    Who wrote this?
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    An Indian astrophysicist I graduated
                    with from Harvard and Prof. West, the
                    preeminent geologist in the US.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    Who else knows about it?
          
                                      ADRIAN
                    No one, sir.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    Let's keep it that way, Helmsley.
          
          Anheuser walks away.

          G8 Summit. Riot police control the unruly crowd with water
          cannons.
          
          We see PROTESTERS with Anti Globalization signs behind a
          fence. A convoy of limousines is approaching a historic
          building.
          
          
          INT. BIG HALL/ALHAMBRA - DAY
          
          We follow the American delegation into the conference room,
          where the other G8 delegations are seated around an enormous
          table.
          
          The President of the United States, THOMAS F. WILSON, 56,
          doesn't sit down. He addresses the room and everybody goes
          quiet.
          
                                      PRESIDENT WILSON (O.S.)
                    Good Morning...
          
          For the first time we see the President's face. He is African-
          American.

                                     PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D)
                    I hereby present a motion to meet
                    privately with my seven fellow Heads of
                    State, kindly excluding the rest of the
                    delegates.
          
          A murmur erupts. The Russian President SERGEY MAKARENKO, 62,
          whispers to one of his interpreters.
          
                                     RUSSIAN INTERPRETER
                    Mr. Makarenko wishes to have his
                    interpreters present.
          
          President Wilson looks over to the Russian Colleague.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON
                    Mr. President, judging from the
                    conversations we've had in the past, I
                    can assure you, your English is
                    absolutely fine, for what I have to
                    say.
          
          As the Russian President waves his interpreter away, all the
          international delegates leave as well.
          
          The huge doors of the hall close. A secret service officer in
          the sound booth switches off the recording equipment to the
          chamber.
          
          The President gathers himself.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D)
                    Six months ago I was made aware of a
                    situation so devastating, that at
                    first, I refused to believe it.

          A huge Chinese military helicopter blasts through a majestic
          mountain valley in Tibet. We are at the top of the world.

          A Chinese COLONEL, wearing dark sun glasses, watches from the
          chopper as the army forces the evacuation of the villages and
          monasteries.

          villagers are evicted by soldiers and herded into trucks.

          Neng's older brother, LIN PANG, 25, is part of a huge crowd
          of young men and women staying behind by a Tibetan school
          building. He turns and yells after the truck.
          
                                     LIN
                    I will send you money mother.

          Eager hands fly up in the air. An official makes notes.

          Lin's hand shoots up in the air. We hear a siren echoing
          through the mountains and suddenly an explosion. Lin turns.
          
          In the BACKGROUND, a series of explosions punch enormous
          holes into the side of the mountain, showering rock
          everywhere.

          A MAN in a dark suit walks through a hallway of the

          plush and luxurious. He's stopped by two security men who
          frisk him.

          A group of dark figures in overalls walk past famous
          Renaissance paintings. They stop at the Mona Lisa.
          
          MANFRED PICARD, 63, head of the French National Museums,
          stands by LAURA, a young African-American woman in her late
          20's. They observe the specialists opening the case of the
          famous painting.

          Laura answers in almost perfect French.
          
                                     LAURA
                    There are too many crazy people who
                    could hurt her, Manfred. The World
                    Heritage Foundation has done this all
                    over the world.
          
          In the BACKGROUND the Mona Lisa is taken off the wall and
          replaced with a perfect replica. Picard still looks uneasy.
          He watches as the real Mona Lisa is sealed into an airtight
          case.
          
                                     MANFRED PICARD

                    the Swiss Alps?
          
                                      LAURA
                    Perfectly safe.
          
          Picard looks suspicious but says nothing. The CAMERA MOVES IN
          on the face of the fake Mona Lisa until all we see is her
          mysterious smile.

          A small tremor rocks the apartment and the dishevelled face
          of JACKSON CURTIS, 33, pops up from behind the couch. He fell
          asleep at his laptop last night.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Oh no. Not again.
          
          One look at his watch and he is off running. He throws some
          clothes and a toothbrush in a bag. His cell phone rings.
          
                                     JACKSON (CONT'D)
                    Hello?... What do you mean? I'm not
                    late. It's not even 10:30...
          
          Jackson turns off the TV and darts towards the door, stopping
          only to slide his laptop into a knapsack. As he turns, he
          stumbles over a stack of books, all shrink-wrapped and
          identically titled: `Farewell Atlantis'.
          
                                     JACKSON (CONT'D)

          Frustrated, he kicks them out of his way and exits. We hold
          on the books and realize that Jackson's photograph is on
          their back covers.

          The phone call continues as Jackson opens the garage door,
          struggling to pack his old SUV with camping equipment.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    They're kids, Kate, going on vacation.
                    It's not a doctor's appointment... it's
                    supposed to be fun. You remember that,
                    right? Fun?
          
          He tries to start the engine, but the battery is dead.
          Frustrated, he hits the steering wheel.
          
                                                                       11.

          throwing it into the trunk of a stretch limo parked by the
          curb.
          
                                     JACKSON

                    the way.
          
          He notices a deep crack in the asphalt. His neighbors, an
          elderly couple, stand there and stare at it.
          
                                     NEIGHBOR

          Jackson passes a man in a wheelchair. He's holding up a
          cardboard sign: `Repent - The End is Near'.

          Jackson switches the radio off. Two kids NOAH, 10, and LILLY,
          7, come running down the driveway. They slow down, as they
          see the limo.

                    can still write.

                    Of course.
          
          Kate's new boyfriend, GORDON SILBERMAN, 43, pulls out of the
          garage in his Porsche wearing his Bluetooth.
          
                                     GORDON
                            (on the phone)
                    Simone, how many times have I told you,
                    we don't do Lipo on Fridays. It's too
                    messy.
          
          Jackson smiles bitterly. Gordon waves at the kids.
          
                                     GORDON (CONT'D)
                    Have fun guys. And watch out for those
                    bears.
                            (to Jackson)
                    Nice car.
          
          Jackson waves grudgingly as Gordon pulls away.

                    Noah needs to read twenty pages from
                    his book each day...
          
          She follows Jackson to the car with a bag of pull-up diapers.

                    before she goes to sleep.
          
                                    JACKSON
                    Still?

          He shuts the trunk and gets back behind the wheel. She looks
          at him seriously.
          
                                     KATE
                    Jackson, they've been really looking
                    forward to this you know. Don't let
                    them down.
          
          He nods as the car pulls away.

                    Well Tony, electronics are cheap there
                    and... you could visit your boy Will.

                    Yes unfortunately I am Harry.

                    He married a Japanese girl - how is
                    that the end of the world? You should

                    Not as much as I'd like. DC is a long

          Suddenly they're thrown off balance by a large swell that
          pulls the massive `Freedom of the Seas' away from the
          landing, about ten yards.
          
          The next moment, the ship slams back against the dock with an
          earthshaking BOOM.

          Jackson starts to climb the fence.
          
                                     NOAH
                    Don't you see the signs?
          
                                      JACKSON
                    It's fine guys.
          
          
          EXT. RIDGE/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY
          
          Jackson and his kids crest a ridge. They look down on a
          parched basin with cracked terrain.
          
          
                                                              (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                       18.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    It's gone. The whole darn lake is gone.
                    I swear you guys there was a lake here.
          
          The kids roll their eyes.
          
          
          EXT. EMPTY LAKE BED/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY
          
          A puddle of water is all that remains of the lake. Jackson
          and the kids walk into the basin, unaware of being watched
          THROUGH BINOCULARS.
          
          Jackson spots an electronic measuring device and crouches to
          have a closer look.
          
          Elsewhere in the lake bed, we see sand seeping through CRACKS
          in the ground.
          
                                       NOAH (O.S.)
                    Jackson!
          
          When he looks up, he sees heavily armed soldiers coming
          towards them from all sides.
          
                                       JACKSON
                    It's okay, Noh'.
          
          Through the BINOCULARS, we see Jackson and his kids arrested
          and led over a ridge.
          
          With this we reveal an ENORMOUS RESEARCH FACILITY with
          hundreds of tents and vehicles surrounding a massive drilling
          tower.
          
          
          EXT. RESEARCH FACILITY/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY
          
          Adrian Helmsley and Prof. West exit the drilling tower, both
          studying papers. Adrian notices Jackson and his kids nearby,
          being interrogated by an OFFICER.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    I'll be with you in a second,
                    Professor.
          
          Adrian walks towards them. Jackson stares at the officer with
          defiance.
          
                                     OFFICER
                    ... And then you climbed over a posted
                    fence? Just like that?
          
                                       NOAH
                    I told you.

                                     JACKSON
                    Isn't this supposed to be a National
                    Park? There shouldn't be fences. What
                    are you guys doing around here anyway?
          
                                     ADRIAN (O.S.)
                    We're geologists...
          
          Jackson turns and sees Adrian standing there.
          
                                     ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    I'll handle this officer. Thank you.
          
          The officer reluctantly hands him Jackson's license.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    So, where did the lake go?
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    That's what we're trying to find out.
                    We think this whole area has become
                    potentially unstable. I would advise
                    you to take your kids and leave, Mr...
          
          He throws a look at Jackson's drivers license.
          
                                    ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    ... Curtis.
          
          He looks up at Jackson with renewed interest.
          
                                     ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    Are you by any chance the Jackson
                    Curtis, the author of `Farewell
                    Atlantis'?
          
                                     JACKSON
                            (SURPRISED)
                    Yeah, that's me.
          
          Jackson straightens up proudly. Lilly smiles.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    What a coincidence. I'm reading your
                    book, as we speak... first third,
                    around day 300, when the shuttle loses
                    communication with earth and drifts off
                    into space.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    You're one of lucky 422 who bought it.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Actually I didn't buy it. My father
                    gave it to me.

                                    JACKSON
                    Oh, I see.
          
          Prof. West waves at Adrian from one of the container labs.
          Adrian hands back Jackson his drivers license.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Officer, can you return them to the
                    campgrounds, please.
                            (to Jackson)
                    Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Curtis.
          
          Jackson and his kids look after Adrian hurrying away.
          
                                     LILLY
                    He was very nice.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Yes he was, Lil'bee.
          
          
          EXT. FOREST TRAIL/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - LATER
          
          Jackson and the kids walk back to the campgrounds when
          suddenly CHARLIE FROST, 62, a crazy looking guy with
          binoculars around his neck, stands in their way.
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST
                    What did the government guys tell you?
          
          Jackson looks at him, instinctively picking up Lilly.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    They think it's not such a good idea to
                    climb over their fences. They feel the
                    area is unstable.
          
          Charlie bursts out laughing.
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST
                    Unstable! Ha-ha! They say its unstable!
                    That's funny...
          
          With this he turns around and leaves.
          
          
          EXT. TENT/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DUSK
          
          Jackson is sitting on a camp chair, right outside the tent.
          He's on his laptop, looking enquiringly at an aerial picture
          of Yellowstone on Google earth.
          
          In the background we see the kids are in the tent.

                                     NOAH
                    There are mosquitos in here. Did
                    anybody spray the tent?
          
          Jackson looks up, remembering he forgot the spray.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    We'll get some of that tomorrow. For
                    tonight just put your head under the
                    blankie.
          
                                     LILLY
                    Daddy you said you weren't gonna work
                    on your book.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    I'm not Honey, I promise. Are you
                    wearing your pull-ups?
          
          Lilly nods as Jackson walks over and tucks her into bed. He
          kisses her good night. He turns and is surprised to see Noah
          typing a text on his cell phone.
          
                                     JACKSON (CONT'D)
                    Did mommy buy you that?
          
                                     NOAH
                    No... Gordon gave it to me for my
                    birthday.
          
          Jackson takes the phone from out of Noah's hands.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Noah. Things like a cell phone have to
                    be discussed in the family.
          
                                       NOAH
                            (BITTER)
                    What family?
          
          Jackson reads the message Noah has typed `Hey Gordon, Camping
          Sucks!'. Hurt, Jackson hands back the phone.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Go to sleep guys.

          A second later the chopper lifts off.
          
          
          INT. LIMO/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DUSK
          
          Jackson has his laptop open with the cursor blinking away on
          the words `Chapter Seven'. But he can't concentrate on
          writing after what Noah has said.
          
          A chopper flies overhead. Jackson follows it's path over the
          campsite and his eyes fall on an American flag fluttering on
          top of a massive radio antennae. This belongs to an RV truck.
          
          Through the RV's window, Jackson sees the silhouette of
          Charlie Frost, the guy with the binoculars, speaking into a
          microphone.
          
          Curious, Jackson flicks on the radio and twists the dial.

                    I wanted to know, where will this all
                    start?
          
          Jackson is intrigued. He puts his laptop down.

                    Bill.
          
          Jackson climbs out of his car and starts towards the RV. He
          can still hear the radio.

                    soon to become the world's largest
                    active volcano.
          
          Charlie is about to take a bite of his sandwich, when there's
          a knock on the door. Jackson sticks his head in.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Hi. Mind if I join you?
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST
                    I only got a few minutes.
          
          Charlie bites into his sandwich as Jackson looks around at
          all the equipment.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    I just heard part of your broadcast...
                    Mind me asking a question? What exactly
                    is it... that will start in Hollywood?

                    Actually it's gonna be the whole west
                    coast...
          
                                     JACKSON
                    What are you talking about?
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST
                    The apocalypse, the end of days. The
                    Mayans knew it, the I Ching and the
                    Bible, kind of...
          
          Charlie looks at his watch.

          Charlie clicks on his laptop.

          A crudely animated film starts to play. Charlie narrates on
          screen in an overly dramatic fashion.
          
                                     CHARLIE'S VOICE
                    In the year 2012 a cataclysmic event
                    will unfold. Caused by an alignment of
                    the planets in our solar system that
                    only happens every 640,000 years...
                    Just imagine the earth as an Orange...
          
          Charlie appears as an animated figure holding an orange.
          
                                     CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                    ... our sun will begin to emit such
                    extreme amounts of radiation, that the
                    core of the earth will melt - that's
                    the inside part of the Orange, leaving
                    the crust of our planet free to shift.
          
          On screen the middle of the orange shrinks, now the skin
          moves freely around it.

          A faded portrait of a scientist appears on screen.

                    The forces of mother nature will be so
                    devastating it will bring an end to
                    this world on winter solstice 12-21-12.
          
          The film ends with an image of the whole earth covered with
          water.
          
          Charlie shuts the laptop.

                    Pretty neat, huh? It's a big hit on
                    YouTube. I did the animation myself.
                            (PAUSE)
                    I know what you're thinking. But all
                    the governments know about this.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    If they all knew, don't you think
                    somebody would tell us?

                                     CHARLIE FROST
                    They can't. Just think about it. First
                    the stockmarket would crash...
          
          Charlie opens a can of beer. Phsssh!
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D)
                    Then the economy... boom. The dollar...
                    boom. And then the people in the
                    streets...
                            (mimicking gun fire)
                    Boom, boom! Pandemonium, revolution,
                    war! They would never tell us. Beer?
          
          Jackson shakes his head still struggling to digest this.
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D)
                    Only if you're some Sheik, Bill Gates,
                    or maybe one of those Russian
                    billionaires do you stand a chance to
                    buy a seat.
          
                                      JACKSON
                    A seat?
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST
                            (INTENSELY)
                    They're building spaceships, man.
          
                                      JACKSON
                    Oh... I see.
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST
                    No really... One of my listeners, a
                    geography professor at UTSC, has even
                    figured out where they're building
                    them. He sent me a map.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Well... Charlie, I think I gotta go. My
                    kids are sleeping.
          
          Charlie looks at him bug eyed.
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST
                    Get them out of Yellowstone, man. It's
                    gonna get ugly here.
          
                                      JACKSON
                    Night, Charlie.
          
          As Jackson exits, Charlie gets back on the air.

                                     CHARLIE FROST
                    Sorry for the delay, folks. But even in
                    times like these, a man has got to
                    eat...
          
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. PARKING LOT OF SUPERMARKET/LOS ANGELES - NIGHT
          
          Westwood. The parking lot of Gelson's is nearly empty.
          
          Eerie silence. Suddenly some of the cars begin to shift in
          place from an unseen force. A small CRACK creases the asphalt
          and slowly crawls towards the brightly lit supermarket.
          
          
          INT. BETWEEN AISLES/SUPERMARKET - NIGHT
          
          Muzak is playing. Kate and her boyfriend Gordon are shopping
          late. She picks up some pull-ups for Lilly, Gordon steps up
          behind her, wrapping his arms around her waist.
          
                                     GORDON
                    Why don't we make a baby?
          
          He reaches up and touches her breasts.
          
                                     KATE
                    Stop it! We're in public.
          
          Gordon lets go of her with mock disappointment.
          
                                     GORDON
                    Honey, I created them. And now suddenly
                    I can't touch them?
          
          Kate pushes him away and moves on.
          
          A few customers are paying at the checkout stand.
          
          BEHIND THEM: Huge glass windows reveal cars slowly sliding
          into the ever widening crack in the parking lot. Nobody
          inside notices.
          
          Gordon catches up with Kate.
          
                                     GORDON (CONT'D)
                    You always act strange after he shows
                    up?
          
                                     KATE
                    Just because I don't care for your
                    arrogant humor doesn't mean I'm acting
                    strange. He is the father of my kids.

                                     GORDON
                    Maybe biologically. Can I remind you
                    what that guy did? First you gave up
                    med school to have Noah... Then you
                    practically raise him and Lilly by
                    yourself while he sat glued to a laptop
                    writing that junk.
          
                                     KATE
                    Some of his stuff is actually... He's
                    published Gordon.
          
                                     GORDON
                            (MOCKINGLY)
                    Yeah, published! You know your mother
                    was right. You've always been drawn to
                    guys with lofty dreams and empty
                    pockets. But not this time right,
                    sweetheart?
          
          Kate smiles awkwardly and picks up a can of soup. The shelf
          in front of her shakes for a moment.
          
                                     KATE
                    Did you see that?
          
                                    GORDON
                    See what?
          
          Kate slowly puts the cans of soup into her cart and looks
          around. Gordon senses a problem between them.
          
                                     GORDON (CONT'D)
                    You know Kate, we have to keep working
                    at this... our relationship. Because I
                    won't end up being just a re-run of you
                    and Jackson.
                            (PAUSE)
                    I mean Honey, I feel like... something
                    is pulling us apart?
          
          Before Gordon finishes his sentence--
          
          A violent ROAR! From front to back, the entire supermarket
          rips open right between Kate and Gordon.
          
          The few customers scream in horror at the sight of the huge
          crevasse forming beneath them. Kate and Gordon are thrown up
          against opposite aisles holding on for dear life.
          
          They cling to the columns as the shelves fold into the ever
          widening crack...
          
                                                                CUT TO:

          INT. CONVENIENCE STORE/YELLOWSTONE - MORNING
          
          Jackson puts down some groceries at the checkout.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Just stop scratching. You'll get them
                    infected.
          
          He smiles at the female cashier behind the counter who does
          not look friendly.
          
                                     JACKSON (CONT'D)
                    Something for Mosquito bites please?
          
                                       CASHIER
                    Before or after?
          
                                       JACKSON
                    What?
          
          The woman looks at Lilly and Noah with their red lumps.
          
                                     CASHIER
                    I'd get before and after.
          
          She slams two mosquito products on the counter.
          
                                     LILLY
                            (POINTING)
                    Look! Mrs. Birnbaum, my teacher is on
                    TV!
          
          On the store's TV: A heavy-set blonde WOMAN, 45, speaking to
          a reporter in front of Gelson's.
          
                                     NOAH
                    That's our supermarket.

                                     ANHEUSER
                    Sir, you have to initiate the boarding
                    process immediately.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON
                    Is this even possible? What's our
                    information from China?
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    They estimate four of the ships will be
                    ready for launch.
          
          The President is shocked by this news.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON
                    Only four?
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    If it's alright with you sir, I'll
                    brief the panel about the new
                    development.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON
                    I'd rather have Adrian do that. They
                    trust him. I told him to be in on the
                    meeting.

                    it would come this soon.

                    Balashin!
          
          The crowd ROARS as the boxer and his entourage enter.
          
          The CAMERA moves in on a tall man with blonde clean cut hair.
          He is well built, wearing designer clothing from head to toe.
          YURI KARPOV, 45, stereotypical Russian oligarch.
          
          He approaches the ringside corner and whistles.

                    Zultan!
          
          The nervous boxer turns.
          
                                     ZULTAN
                            (in Russian)
                    Ah, finally, Yuri. I thought I would
                    not see you.
          
          Yuri hits the boxer's gloves. Zultan is nervous. His coach
          steps in.
          
                                     COACH
                    He needs to concentrate now, Mister

                    You shut up... when I talk to my boy,
                    understand?
          
                                       COACH
                    Yes, Mr. Karpov.
          
                                     YURI
                    Good... That is good.

                             BOXER)
                    Zultan my friend. Do not forget. We are
                    fighters. We never go down. We always
                    stay on our feet...
          
          Zultan just keeps nodding, pumping himself up.
          
                                     YURI (CONT'D)
                    ... No matter who is hitting us. No
                    matter how hard.
          
          GONG. First Round. The fight is on.

          Yuri walks to his seat, sitting down next to his trophy:
          
          TAMARA, 28, blonde, wears the shortest mini one can imagine,
          designer shoes, handbag, glasses and boobs. In her lap she
          holds CAESAR, a tiny dog wearing a diamond collar.
          
          In the ring the boxers maul at each other. Yuri's cell phone
          beeps. It's a text message:
          
          START BOARDING PROCEDURE
          
          Yuri's whole demeanor changes. Without a word, he gets up and
          walks out of the arena.
          
                                     TAMARA
                    Yuri bear... where are you going?
          
          Yuri does not respond as he squeezes through the crowd.
          
          Zultan, the boxer, notices Yuri leave. In that split second
          distraction, he is hit HARD and goes down for the count.
          
          The crowd ROARS!

          Jackson ignores him and starts throwing the luggage into the
          limo. The other twin notices his muddy sneakers.

                    Careful with our stuff. Don't get it
                    dirty.
          
          
          EXT. STREETS/LOS ANGELES - MORNING
          
          Ahead of the limo a crowd has formed in the streets, singing
          songs and chanting about the end of days. A SKINNY MAN with a
          ponytail preaches from the scriptures.
          
                                     PREACHER
                    ... There will be famines, pestilences
                    and earthquakes, sayeth the Lord.
          
          Jackson has to maneuver through the people. Banners read:
          `Prepare for the End'-- 'You cannot escape his judgement'--
          
          Alec looks up from his video game, annoyed.
          
                                     ALEC
                    Curtis, can't you go faster?
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Are you guys blind? I can't run people
                    over.
          
                                     OLEG
                    Why not? They're idiots anyway.
          
          Jackson shoots these spoilt brats an angry look.
          
                                                                      35.
          
          EXT. SANTA MONICA AIRPORT/LOS ANGELES - MORNING
          
          Jackson stops in front of the Gulfstream. SASHA, 40, Yuri's
          Russian pilot is expecting them.
          
                                     SASHA
                    Hey Jackson. Took you a while...
          
          Jackson mutters under his breath as he unloads the luggage,
          dropping one of them on Alec's foot on purpose.
          
                                     ALEC
                    Ouch! Be more careful!
          
          The other twin has noticed Jackson's intensions. He gets into
          his face.
          
                                     OLEG
                    Now you're laughing, Curtis. But we are
                    going on a big ship.
                            (PAUSE)
                    We will live... and you will die.
          
          Oleg grins back at Jackson as the jet door closes. The
          Gulfstream taxis onto the runway.
          
          As Jackson turns back to the car a fine surface crack shoots
          across the tarmac. We hold on his face as it hits him like a
          ton of bricks:
          
          THE CRAZY RADIO HOST, CHARLIE FROST WAS RIGHT!
          
          Frantically Jackson looks around and spots a MAN in overalls
          working on a twin engine Cessna. He runs to him.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Where can I rent a plane?
          
          The man points to a shabby office building.
          
                                                                   CUT TO:

          Kate is in her kitchen cooking breakfast for the kids. Gordon
          watches the Governor on the news.
          
                                     GOVERNOR

                    hours we had basically zero earthquake
                    activity in Southern California, which
                    is very rare...

          The phone rings. Kate picks up.
          
          
          EXT. STREETS/LOS ANGELES - MORNING
          
          Jackson drives like crazy.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    ... Kate, we have to get out of LA!
                    I've rented a plane for us. Get the
                    kids ready! I'll be there in five.
          
                                     KATE
                    The kids have plans today...
          
                                     JACKSON

                    No I'm not! Noah has music at 2 and
                    Lil' has Karate.
          
          Gordon rolls his eyes and mutters.
          
                                     GORDON
                    Not that we'd expect him to remember.
          
                                     JACKSON

                                     JACKSON
                    The Governor's a meathead, how would he
                    know anything? Kate listen! You gotta
                    trust me over some politician. Come on.
          
          
          INT. KATE'S HOUSE/LOS ANGELES - MORNING
          
          Kate slams the phone down. Lilly stops eating.
          
                                     LILLY
                    Mommy, why are you so angry with Daddy?
          
                                     LAURA
                    Because your daddy is a lunatic,
                    darling.
          
          On the TV, the interview comes to an end.

                    ... it looks to me, like the worst is
                    over.
          
          That moment a MASSIVE QUAKE hits Los Angeles.
          
          Everybody dives under the table.
          
          ON TV: The news casters and the Governor do the same. A few
          seconds later the signal cuts out.
          
          Gordon pulls Kate and the kids close as the earth shakes
          violently for 20 seconds.
          
          
          EXT. KATE'S HOUSE/LOS ANGELES - MORNING
          
          Jackson flies into the driveway and runs into the house.
          
          
          INT. KATE'S HOUSE/LOS ANGELES - MORNING
          
          When he enters, Lilly immediately runs into his arms. The
          next tremor hits. Cracks form on the kitchen floor.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    We have to leave! Noah, let's go!
          
                                     KATE
                    I think we're safer here!
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Noah, now! Kate please...
          
          The whole house rides up and down like on a wave.
          
                                     GORDON
                    I think he's right.
          
          Finally Kate pushes her son out from under the table. They
          all scramble out of the house in a panic. Kate is cut on the
          shoulder by falling glass but she hardly notices.
          
          
          EXT. KATE'S HOUSE/LOS ANGELES - MORNING
          
          As they storm out of their front door the house crumbles
          behind them.
          
                                      JACKSON
                    Get in the car!
          
          The whole street starts to buckle. Left and right the houses
          are shaken and smashed like toys.
          
          
                                                              (CONTINUED)

          Just before the wave of destruction can reach them, Jackson
          tears out of the driveway.
          
          
          EXT. STREETS/LOS ANGELES - MORNING
          
          Jackson maneuver's the limo through the crumbling
          neighborhood. Right in front of their eyes, streets
          disappear, trees fall, electrical lines snap. Sewer pipes
          burst in front of the car.
          
                                     NOAH
                    Holy shit!
          
          Jackson has to turn on the windshield wipers.
          
          
          EXT. SANTA MONICA AIRPORT/LOS ANGELES - MORNING
          
          The limo crashes through a gate onto the tarmac, coming to a
          stop in front of a twin engine Cessna.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Damn it! Where's the pilot?
          
          Kate turns to Gordon.
          
                                     KATE
                    Gordon, you know how to fly.
          
                                     GORDON
                    I... had a couple lessons...
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Did you cover taking off?
          
                                     GORDON
                    Yeah.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    That's good enough for me.
          
          They start running, when Jackson remembers something and
          heads back to the Limo.
          
          He grabs his knapsack from the front seat fumbling to zip his
          laptop back inside it. Kate shouts.
          
                                     KATE (O.S.)
                    Jackson, what are you doing?
          
                                     JACKSON
                    I'm coming.
          
          He jumps out of the car and races back after them. Behind
          Jackson the hangar starts to disintegrate.

          IN THE DISTANCE
          
          A gigantic fissure forms in the earth, shooting towards Santa
          Monica airport.
          
          Gordon fumbles with the controls, Jackson yells from the
          copilot seat.
          
                                     JACKSON (CONT'D)
                    Come on, come on...
          
                                     GORDON
                            (pointing at the
                             INSTRUMENTS)
                    But I'm supposed to check all these
                    first...
          
          Jackson reaches over and slams Gordon's hand down and the
          plane lurches forward.
          
          As the Cessna speeds onto the tarmac the control tower goes
          down and explodes.
          
          Noah discovers the giant crevasse forming behind them.
          
                                       NOAH
                    Guys, behind us!
          
          As the plane accelerates, the giant crack closes in on them.
          Gordon's hand trembles on the throttle control. Everybody
          screams on top of each other.
          
                                     EVERYBODY
                    Gordon! Damn it! Lift off!
          
          Gordon gathers his courage and pulls the lever. The plane
          almost rockets into the air just as the ground beneath them
          gives way.
          
          They hover for a moment, almost caught in mid-air as the
          widening crevasse beneath them fights to suck them into the
          bowels of the earth. Gordon fights to maintain control but
          they begin to be pulled down.
          
          The daylight vanishes. Debris and mud smashes into the plane
          from all sides. The canyon walls erupt.
          
                                     GORDON
                    I can't get it up!
          
          Taking desperate measures, Gordon nearly rips the control
          stick out of its joint - with a lurch the Cessna lifts out of
          the abyss.
          
          
          
                                                            (CONTINUED)

          They all take a deep breath only to realize that now they are
          flying directly into the collapsing towers of downtown Los
          Angeles!
          
          Like a roller coaster, Gordon manages to weave the little
          plane through the tumbling high rises.
          
          They dive one last time to evade the plummeting US BANK
          TOWER, the tallest building on the west coast.
          
          All are dead silent as they watch the whole of Los Angeles
          crumble beneath them. Kate covers Lilly's eyes.
          
                                     NOAH
                            (in total shock)
                    That was amazing, Gordon!
          
          Jackson looks at Kate and notices her cut.
          
                                    JACKSON
                    Are you okay?

                            (brushing it off)
                    I'm fine. How did you know this was
                    gonna happen?
          
                                     JACKSON
                    I didn't.
                            (To Gordon)
                    Do we have enough fuel to make it to
                    Yellowstone?
          
          The plane veers off in a northeasterly direction. Behind them
          the destruction of Los Angeles continues.

          The gigantic cruise ship plows through the Pacific. We hear
          lounge music...
          
          
          INT. BAR/FREEDOM OF THE SEAS - DAY
          
          Adrian's father Harry and his partner Tony are on stage.
          Harry on the piano, singing, Tony playing the bass. A waiter
          brings drinks. Water for Harry, and a brightly colored
          cocktail for Tony.
          
                                     WAITER
                    You got fans Tony...

          Tony raises his glass to two old ladies who are sitting at
          the bar.
          
                                     WAITER (CONT'D)
                    There's a call for you Harry. Want me
                    to take a message?
          
                                     HARRY
                            (while still playing)
                    I'll be right there.
          
          The waiter nods. A few more bars of music, then applause.
          
                                     HARRY (CONT'D)
                            (into the microphone)
                    Thank you ladies and gentlemen. Let's
                    hear it for the one and only Tony
                    Delgado... And I'm Harry Helmsley and
                    we'll be back after a short pit stop.
          
          Applause. Harry rushes off stage.

                    Dad... what I have to tell you is very
                    serious...

          Adrian is standing in a dark corner. Behind him people are
          packing up, carrying boxes.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    You remember when I told you about the
                    dam in China? Well, it's happening much
                    sooner than we anticipated.
          
          
          INT. GALLEY/CRUISE SHIP - DAY
          
          Harry's face has turned serious.
          
                                     ADRIAN (O.S.)
                    The President has ordered us to clear
                    out the White House.
          
                                     HARRY
                    Hah... About time someone cleaned up
                    that mess.
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY/WHITE HOUSE - DAY
          
          Adrian fights back the tears.

                                     ADRIAN
                    Where are you, dad? What exactly is the
                    course of the `Freedom' right now?...
          
                                     HARRY (O.S.)
                    It's all good, Adrian. Don't worry
                    about your old man. You have more
                    important things to do now.
          
          
          INT. GALLEY/CRUISE SHIP - DAY
          
          There's a tremor in Harry's voice.
          
                                     HARRY
                    You know, your mom and I, we had a hell
                    of a great life... and a hell of a
                    great kid too.
                            (PAUSE)
                    And the `Freedom' is a pretty big ship
                    you know... Don't write your old man
                    off, just yet.
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY/WHITE HOUSE - DAY
          
          A tear runs down Adrian's face.
          
                                     HARRY (O.S.)
                    ... Besides, I could never leave Tony
                    alone. You know how he can't keep
                    decent time by himself.
          
          Pause.
          
                                       ADRIAN

          Back in the lounge, Tony has finished his cocktail. Harry
          walks up and hollers at the barkeeper.
          
                                     HARRY

                                     HARRY
                    Why not? Who cares how long we do
                    certain things? How long we drink
                    booze, how long we talk to people... Or
                    how long we don't talk to people.
          
          Harry grabs Tony by his shirt.
          
                                     TONY
                    Woah!... Harry, what's the matter with
                    you? Let's go. We're back on.
          
          Harry pulls him even closer.
          
                                     HARRY
                    Call your kid, you stubborn old ass.

                    I'm not going back on that stage unless

                    Promise me, Tony... please.
          
          Harry stares him down.
          
                                     TONY
                    Yeah, maybe I should call him...
          
          Harry smiles, downs his bourbon and walks back on stage.

                    the Western seaboard was hit...
          
          Assistants stare at the news in shocked disbelief, some of
          them are crying. Prof. West appears at the door.

          Prof. West silently nods and beckons Adrian, who follows him
          down the hall into a dark control room. They look at a wall-
          sized high def monitor.
          
                                     PROF. WEST

          On the monitors, detailed satellite imagery displays how the

          Gordon manages to land the plane next to what looks like a
          fueling station. Jackson leaps out checking the pump.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Guys, there's fuel! Fill her up and
                    I'll look for Charlie.

          Jackson runs off towards the hills.

                    It's fine! I'll take her.
          
          Kate watches as they disappear, worried. Noah and Gordon have
          started to fuel the plane.

          open. They enter. The key is in the ignition. The radio
          transmitters are on, but Charlie is gone. Jackson fiddles
          with the switches and Charlie's voice comes on.
          
                                     CHARLIE'S VOICE
                    ... I am standing here at the highest

                    He's got to be close by, Lil'bee...
          
          Jackson jumps behind the wheel and turns the ignition.

                                     JACKSON
                    Listen to me. We have to find Charlie.
                    He's got a secret map, you know, like
                    Jack Sparrow in `Pirates'.
          
          That catches her interest.

                    Lil', we have to work as a team now,
                    okay? You have to help me.
          
          Jackson passes her his mobile phone. Lilly nods. He throws
          the RV into gear and they speed off over the bumpy terrain.

                    Hi mommy...
          
                                     KATE
                    Where are you, honey!?
          
          
          INT. RV/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY
          
          Jackson hears the stress in Kate's voice. He hisses at Lilly.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Tell her we'll be back in ten minutes.

                    We're looking for a secret map, mommy.
          
          Jackson grimaces.
          
          
          EXT. RESEARCH FACILITY/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY
          
          Kate tries to keep it together for Lilly.
          
                                     KATE
                    Let me speak to your daddy, darling.
          
                                     LILLY (O.S.)
                    Daddy can't talk right now, he's
                    driving really fast...
          
          
          INT. RV/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY
          
          The RV runs over a boulder. Lilly hits the roof.
          
                                    LILLY
                    Ouch!

                    LILLY!
          
          In the background Kate hears the voice of Charlie Frost.
          
                                     CHARLIE'S VOICE
                    ... I tell you guys, any minute now...
                    any minute the fireworks will start...
          
                                     KATE (O.S.)
                    Who's in the car with you? Who's that
                    man screaming?
          
                                     LILLY
                    He's not in the car. He's on a mountain
                    waiting for fireworks.
                                                              (CONTINUED)

          Lilly spots Charlie way up on a ridge. He has erected his ten
          foot radio antenna with the flag fluttering on top.
          
                                     LILLY (CONT'D)
                            (to Jackson)
                    There he is! Up there!
          
                                     JACKSON
                    You're the best, darling. Give Daddy
                    the phone...
                            (into the phone)
                    Kate I am sorry, I can't talk...
          
          The road ends just below the mountain peak.
          
                                     KATE (O.S.)
                    Bring back my child, Jackson! NOW!
          
          Jackson sees Charlie up above, broadcasting. He hangs up the
          phone and jumps out of the RV.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    You wait here for me! You watch the
                    ship while Captain Curtis talks to the
                    pirate. Okay?

                    Okay...
          
          Jackson climbs up to Charlie.
          
          
          EXT. MOUNTAIN PEAK/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY
          
          Charlie has his broadcasting equipment strapped to his body.
          The antenna's flag is whipping in the wind.
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST
                            (into his mic)
                    ... I wish you guys at home could see
                    this on TV...
          
          He notices Jackson and muffles the microphone.
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D)
                    How did you make it up here? Thought
                    you were toast.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    The spaceships Charlie, where are they?
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST
                    You can't make it there.

                                     JACKSON
                    We have a plane. We can get you out of
                    here too. Let's go Charlie!
          
          All around the landscape begins to collapse. A three mile
          crater forms, revealing the awe-inspiring sight of the super-
          volcano.
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST
                    You'll never make it out in time. Just
                    stay and enjoy the big bang. That your
                    kid?
          
          Jackson discovers Lilly standing behind him, staring at
          Charlie with her big brown eyes.
          
          Jackson grabs Charlie lifting him off the ground.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Where is that god damn map!
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST
                    Easy, easy. Watch the mic... I don't
                    know. Somewhere in my camper.
          
          A low rumble builds to a rapturous thunder as MILLIONS OF
          BIRDS tear into flight.
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D)
                    Wow! Look at that!...

          The mouth of the volcano starts to break apart revealing
          molten lava underneath.
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D)
                    ... the last of mankind. Soon they'll

                    there in the milky way...
          
          Jackson grabs his wide eyed daughter and races down the
          mountain.

          Jackson and Lilly jump into the RV and races off, with
          Charlie's broadcast still playing.
          
                                     CHARLIE'S VOICE

                    First the lights will go out in Vegas,
                    then Dallas, St. Louis and then
                    Washington DC...
          
          Jackson's cell phone rings and he picks up.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    We're on our way.

                    Jackson, things are really looking bad
                    here!
          
          In that instant, the air around them vanishes, as if sucked
          from the landscape into a vacuum.
          
          THE BIGGEST EXPLOSION THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN... At least in
          the last 640,000 years.
          
          To them, all this occurs in total silence. The sound of the
          eruption has not reached them yet.
          
          They are frozen, unable to comprehend what is happening.
          
          
          EXT. MOUNTAIN PEAK/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY
          
          The explosion begins to resembles an atomic mushroom.
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST
                    ... it's beautiful, kids! Just
                    beautiful!
          
          The sound waves reach Charlie, throwing him to the ground.
          
          
          EXT. DIRT ROAD/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY
          
          The RV flies over the rugged terrain. Everywhere the earth is
          cracking, falling apart. Jackson struggles to swerve around
          the disappearing landscape.
          
                                     LILLY

          Lilly has discovered the expanding ASH CLOUD behind them.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Just don't look back, Lil'bee!
          
          The THUNDERING sound envelopes them! On the radio, the voice
          of Charlie is getting shrill.

          EXT. MOUNTAIN PEAK/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY
          
          Charlie slowly tries to stand again, silhouetted against the
          cloud of dust and fire towering above him.
          
          Flaming rocks fly towards him. When they hit the ground, they
          detonate like fire bombs.
          
                                     CHARLIE'S VOICE
                    Oh baby! It's coming!
          
          
          EXT. DIRT ROAD/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY
          
          Rocks plummet like comets around the RV as Jackson races over
          a collapsing bridge. On the radio, in his delirious state,
          Charlie begins to sing...
          
                                     CHARLIE'S VOICE
                    `This is the end, my friend'...
          
          Yellowstone looks like a war zone. The RV dodges the
          bombardment of fire and rock.
          
          
          EXT. MOUNTAIN PEAK/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY
          
          Huge tree trunks and glowing boulders fly at Charlie through
          the ashes. He screams at the top of his lungs.
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST
                    ... Folks, always remember, you heard
                    it first from Charlie.
          
          A second later, Charlie's radio antenna comes spinning like a
          scythe through the air. It decapitates Charlie in an instant.
          
          
          EXT. DIRT ROAD/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY
          
          The radio cuts out. The forest and the camp grounds are mown
          flat by the extreme force of the ASH CLOUD. In the rear view
          mirror Jackson sees it gaining on them.
          
                                    JACKSON
                    LILLY! DOWN!
          
          A firebomb hits the RV, ripping half the roof off.
          
          Lilly barely makes it under the dashboard.
          
          
                                                               (CONTINUED)

                                     JACKSON (CONT'D)
                    Stay down there, Lil'! We're almost
                    there! Just keep looking at daddy.
          
          Jackson spots the little Cessna in the distance.
          
          
          EXT. EMPTY ARMY BASE/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY
          
          At the entrance to the airstrip a huge crevasse forms,
          cutting the RV off from reaching the plane.
          
          Lilly sticks out her head.
          
                                       LILLY
                    Mommy!
          
          Jackson swerves wildly to miss the crack, sending Lilly
          flying out. Without thinking, he lets go of the wheel,
          lunging after her and pulling her back inside.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Stay down darling.
          
          Jackson races the RV alongside the forming crack.
          
          Spotting a narrow point in the crevasse, he makes a decision.
          Slamming the accelerator down, he races towards it at full
          speed.
          
          Moments later the RV is airborne!
          
          Kate watches, too shocked to scream. A few drawn out seconds.
          
          Then the RV touches down, crashing 200 feet from the plane.
          
          Kate runs towards the wreckage of the camper. Lilly jumps
          out, racing into her mom's arms. Jackson turns and sees the
          cloud approaching.
          
                                     JACKSON (CONT'D)
                    You guys go! I'll be right there!
          
          Kate pulls Lilly back to the plane.
          
          Jackson jumps into the back of the RV scavenging through the
          shelves, looking for Charlie's map.
          
          Kate lifts Lilly onto the wing of the plane. Gordon revs up
          the engines.
          
                                     NOAH
                    Give me your hand, Lil'.
          
          Noah pulls his little sister into the cockpit.

                                                                       52.
          
          Fiery rocks rain from the sky, detonating to the right and
          left of their plane as Kate climbs in.
          
                                     GORDON
                    We have to take off!
          
                                      NOAH
                    No!
          
                                      LILLY
                    Where's daddy?!
          
                                     GORDON
                    Kate, I'm sorry but if we wait we'll
                    all die!
          
          Gordon pushes the throttle. The plane starts to move. Kate
          screams.
          
                                      KATE
                    Gordon! Wait!
          
          Back in the RV, Jackson is frantically going through the
          masses of books and papers on the shelves. Finally, a map. He
          unfolds it. But it's only of the London underground system.
          
          He throws it to the ground and finds another. This time he's
          lucky! There are markings everywhere.
          
          As he races to the door, the ground gives way beneath the RV.
          Kate and the kids watch it disappear from sight.
          
                                      KATE (CONT'D)
                    JACKSON! NO!
          
          Noah begins to cry and Lilly clings to her mom. Gordon just
          stares, paralyzed.
          
          The ASH CLOUD is almost upon them!
          
          Gordon takes action and accelerates the plane.
          
          Kate turns back. A hand emerges from the crevasse. Then
          another, holding a map. Her face lights up.
          
                                      LILLY
                    It's daddy!
          
          Jackson pulls himself up and sprints towards them, the map in
          his hand.
          
                                      KATE
                    Jackson! Here!
          
          Kate leans out of the cockpit reaching for him.
          
                                                            (CONTINUED)

                                     NOAH
                    Faster Dad. You can make it!
          
                                     GORDON
                    Kate, grab him for god sake. We're
                    almost out of runway.
          
          Using every last ounce of energy, Jackson leaps onto the wing
          and is yanked into the plane by Kate.
          
          Just at that moment, the plane lifts off.
          
          Jackson falls into the cockpit, completely out of breath.
          Lilly crawls over and hugs him.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Thanks for waiting guys.
          
          Now all eyes are glued to the speedometer. 180... 190...
          
          The violent ASH CLOUD is hitting their tail rudder. The plane
          swerves wildly! Gordon gets it back under control.
          
          The speedometer finally creeps towards 200 mph and the CLOUD
          slowly falls back. Everybody breathes a sigh of relief.
          
                                     KATE
                    So, now that you got your map, where
                    are we going?
          
          Jackson unfolds it and takes a look. Hundreds of markings
          clutter the map. In the left corner he discovers a large
          letter C followed by H - I - N - A.
          
          He looks up.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    We're gonna need a bigger plane.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. WEST WING/WHITE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
          
          The White House is being evacuated. Amidst the chaos stands
          Anheuser. Adrian puts down a phone and looks at him.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Just a few minutes ago Yellowstone
                    erupted, sir. The ash cloud will reach
                    Washington in roughly 7 hours. Maybe 6.
                    We have strong easterly winds...
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    And the crustal displacement?
          
                                                              (CONTINUED)

                                     ADRIAN
                    No one knows, sir.
          
          Anheuser starts walking, Adrian trails behind.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    Let's get the government airborne
                    and... I mean now.
          
          
          INT. OVAL OFFICE/WHITE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Anheuser and Adrian burst into the Anteroom of the Oval
          Office. The President's secretary, SALLY, 55, is packing.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    Where is the President, Sally?
          
          Sally looks up stone faced.
          
                                     SALLY
                    He said he wanted to spend a few
                    minutes alone. I think he's over at the
                    chapel.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    The whole North American continent is
                    about to perish, and Wilson decides to
                    go to church!
          
          Adrian shoots an angry look at Anheuser.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    He's praying sir. Which considering the
                    circumstances is not a bad idea.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    Maybe. But right now I need the leader
                    of the free world off his knees and on
                    Air Force One. Wheels up 1900 hours.
                    Can I leave that with you Helmsley?
          
          Anheuser walks away. Adrian and Sally exchange a look.
          
                                     SALLY
                    I really don't like that man.
          
          
          INT. CHAPEL/WHITE HOUSE - SUNSET
          
          Adrian finds the President standing near the front of the
          chapel.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Mr. President? We need to get you out
                    of Washington immediately.
                                                              (CONTINUED)

          President Wilson stays with his head bowed.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON
                    Now matter how idealistic you are
                    taking office. You lose your innocence
                    behind that desk.
                            (PAUSE)
                    Laura was right. People have died
                    because of the decisions I made.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    That's not your fault sir.
          
          He turns to face Adrian.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON
                    You sound like Anheuser.
          
          This quietly affects Adrian.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D)
                    Laura's never looked at me like that
                    before. Only once... When I told her,
                    her mother had died. You knew the first
                    lady?
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    A little.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON
                    You know what she said to me that night
                    we brought her to the hospital?
                            (PAUSE)
                    `Tommy... I think you should do a
                    lottery. Every one should have a chance
                    to go'. That's what Dorothy said to me.
                    That's what we should have done.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    There would have been chaos, sir.
          
          President Wilson looks Adrian in the eyes.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON
                    You know what I believe, Adrian. I
                    believe nature should choose for
                    itself, from itself.
          
          Adrian takes this in.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D)
                    Don't let her go. You'll regret it if
                    you do. Prove to Laura what kind of a
                    man you are. And I'll do the same...
                    You go now. And watch your back for
                    Anheuser.
                                                             (CONTINUED)

          Adrian stares at the President in disbelief.
          
                                    ADRIAN
                    But sir?
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON
                    Go. That's an order Helmsley.
          
          A tense moment before Adrian starts to walk away. Just as he
          exits the chapel, Wilson calls after him.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D)
                    Would you tell my daughter... there's
                    nothing on earth that I cherish more
                    than her.
          
          We hold on President Wilson's face.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. LAS VEGAS - SUNSET
          
          Most of Las Vegas is destroyed. A 200 foot wide canyon now
          divides sin city along its famous strip. The towering casinos
          still teeter along the canyon's rim.
          
          All forms of emergency rescue operations are deployed around
          the city.
          
          In the FOREGROUND, we see Las Vegas International Airport,
          its runway cut dramatically short. Large pieces of tarmac
          continue to break off into the crevasse.
          
          
          EXT. AIRFIELD/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - SUNSET
          
          Gordon maneuvers his plane through the chaos. Airplanes are
          strewn about the runway. Passengers everywhere.
          
                                     GORDON
                    I told you we should have gone to my
                    parents' in the Rockies.
          
                                     KATE
                    Gordon's right. Look at this mess.
          
          Jackson looks around frantically.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    You don't understand, it's our only
                    chance.

                                     GORDON
                    This isn't one of your crazy stories
                    now. How the hell are we gonna make it
                    to China?
          
                                     NOAH
                    Gordon, without Jackson, we'd never
                    have made it out of California.
          
          Silence. Noah is right and they know it. They taxi past a
          private jet whose front wheel is stuck in a hole in the
          tarmac.
          
          We hear a dog barking and the CAMERA finds Tamara, with
          Caesar in her arms.
          
                                     YURI (O.S.)
                    Careful with the landing gear!
                            (in Russian)
                    Tamara, get the boys out of the way!
          
          An airport tow truck attempts to pull Yuri's Gulfstream jet
          out. Sasha, the pilot, helps. A safety announcement echoes
          through the whole area.
          
                                     VOICE
                            (over loudspeaker)
                    Attention! The US National Guard has
                    informed us, that an extremely
                    hazardous ash cloud is headed towards
                    the city of Las Vegas.
          
          Tamara looks scared and secretly reaches for Sasha's hand.
          They share an intimate look, no one else sees.
          
                                     VOICE (CONT'D)
                    We strongly advise every one to move
                    indoors immediately...
          
          The tow truck driver panics and runs inside.
          
          We move in on Yuri. For the first time he looks helpless.
          
          In the background, Jackson and his family join the panicked
          crowd heading towards the terminal building. Firemen and
          rescue workers usher them forward.
          
                                     FIRE MAN
                    Let's move people! Inside the terminal!
          
          Jackson and his family are swept along.
          
                                                                CUT TO:

          INT. AIR FORCE ONE/ARLINGTON AIRPORT - DUSK
          
          Adrian rushes up the stairs of Air Force One, approaching one
          of the flight officers.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Where's Anheuser?
          
                                     OFFICER
                    In the command center, sir.
          
          Adrian moves on.
          
          
          INT. COMMAND CENTER/AIR FORCE ONE - DUSK
          
          Adrian enters. Anheuser immediately senses something is
          amiss.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    The President is not coming. I couldn't
                    convince him to.
          
          Everyone in the room looks up, speechless.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    So, the captain doesn't want to leave
                    his sinking ship?
                            (PAUSE)
                    Well, Mr. Helmsley, we just learned
                    that the Vice President's chopper
                    crashed 80 miles north of Atlanta.
          
          Adrian is shocked.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    What about the Speaker of the House?
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    In this chaos... I have no idea!
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    But she's Commander In Chief now. Sir,
                    I just think -
          
          Anheuser moves in dangerously close.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    I don't care what you think, Helmsley.
          
          Laura quietly enters the Command Center, as Anheuser and
          Adrian stare each other down.

                                     ANHEUSER (CONT'D)
                    Your ass only made it into the White
                    House, because your old man knew the
                    First Lady... and because of all that
                    affirmative action bullshit.
          
          Anheuser takes it even further.
          
                                     ANHEUSER (CONT'D)
                    There was a white kid, much more
                    qualified than you. Just so you know.
          
          Adrian's face is ashen.
          
                                     LAURA (O.S.)
                    Where is my father?
          
          Everyone turns to Laura. Silence.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    He wanted to stay with his people.
          
          Suddenly, the engines of Air Force One turn over. Laura
          panics.
          
                                     LAURA
                    We have to go back!
          
          Adrian tries to hold her close to him. Anheuser sees this
          intimate moment and gives a suspicious, questioning look. A
          second later Laura pushes Adrian away.
          
                                     LAURA (CONT'D)
                    Let me get out. Mr. Anheuser - tell the
                    Captain.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    There is a protocol for just this
                    situation Ms. Wilson and I'm afraid
                    we'll have to follow it to the letter.
          
          Anheuser turns to an officer.
          
                                     ANHEUSER (CONT'D)
                    Tell the Captain, to take off
                    immediately.
          
          Laura looks at him incredulously.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:

          Emergency lights illuminate the densely populated terminal.

                    People, stay away from the windows!
          
          One of the rescue workers yells, pushing Jackson and his
          family back.
          
          Frustrated, Jackson turns to Kate and Gordon.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    We can't get stuck here.
          
          Suddenly a voice...
          
                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                    Dr. Silberman? What are you doing here?
          
          They all turn and stare at Tamara, holding her little dog
          against her plump breasts.
          
          Kate gives Gordon a look.
          
                                     GORDON
                            (EMBARRASSED)
                    She's a patient, honey.
          
                                     JACKSON
                            (SARCASTICALLY)
                    Nice work.
          
          But when Jackson discovers Yuri behind her, his tone suddenly
          changes. He gets in Yuri's face.
          
                                     JACKSON (CONT'D)
                    You bastard. You knew it all along!
                            (at the twins)
                    You and those spoiled rotten sons of
                    yours...
          
          Sasha comes running in and cuts through this.
          
                                     SASHA
                    I found us a plane, an Antonov. They
                    were just about to take off, but the
                    tower didn't let them.
          
                                     YURI
                    Can you still fly that thing?
          
                                     SASHA
                    Sure... But I need a copilot.
          
          Lilly chimes in.
          
                                     LILLY
                    Gordon is a pilot.
          
                                                              (CONTINUED)

          Before Gordon can protest Jackson picks up Lilly.
          
                                       JACKSON
                    Let's go!
          
          They burst through the emergency exit, setting off an alarm.
          Emergency personnel yell after them.
          
                                     RESCUE WORKER
                    Hey! Stop! You can't go out there! Come
                    back!
          
          But they keep on running. Sasha now leads the way.
          
          
          EXT. AIR FIELD/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK
          
          They race around the corner and come to a halt. Before them,
          a Russian freight plane of enormous size--
          
          The ANTONOV 225, the biggest aircraft in the world.
          
                                     NOAH
                    Wow, that is a big plane.

                            (PROUDLY)
                    It's Russian.
          
          Sasha, who has run ahead turns back and sees:
          
          A MASSIVE GREY WALL OF ASH moving towards the airport.
          
                                       SASHA
                    Guys, follow me!
          
          They all run after him up the stairs.

          Sasha enters the cockpit and puts on the headset while

                            (into the mic)
                    You'll find folding seats on each side

          They all scramble to get into their seats.

                    Wow! Look at those!
          
          They discover the cargo they are carrying--
          
          Sports cars, SUV's, concept cars and luxury models, some of
          them are labeled `Las Vegas Auto Show 2012'.

          The six engines of the Antonov come roaring to life.

          The plane is starting to move. Gordon sits uncomfortably in

                                     SASHA
                    You check the main bus for the

                                    GORDON
                    Uh... What?
          
          Sasha reaches over and does it himself.
          
                                     SASHA
                    Work the radio and keep an eye on the
                    fuel, okay?
          
          Gordon nods and puts on the headset, trying to focus.

          EXT. RUNWAY/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK
          
          The Antonov steadily gains speed as it rumbles down the
          cracked and uneven runway.
          
          The canyon that has swallowed half the city looms ahead. And
          behind them the volcanic cloud bears down.
          
          
          INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DUSK
          
          Sasha stares down the gap ahead, determined. Gordon's face is
          as white as a sheet.
          
                                     GORDON
                    We're not gonna make it!
          
                                     SASHA
                    Shut up! We will!
          
          
          INT. TERMINAL/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK
          
          The violent cloud has finally reached the airport. The
          terminals are hit by flying debris.
          
          Seconds later, Yuri's Gulfstream is whipped through the air,
          shattering the huge windows into a thousand pieces.
          
          People are thrown like rag dolls as the jet explodes in a
          massive fireball.
          
          
          INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DUSK
          
          Kate and Jackson hold their kids tight. Tamara clings to
          little Caesar and Yuri to his twins.
          
                                                                       64.
          
          EXT. RUNWAY/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK
          
          The Antonov lumbers heavily towards the inevitable drop off
          on the horizon. The runway is way too short...
          
          And to make matters worse, the ground begins to move again,
          slowly arching the tarmac upwards, creating a crooked ramp at
          the end of it.
          
          
          INT. COCKPIT/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK
          
          A drop of sweat trickles down Sasha's forehead as he pulls
          back the wheel.
          
          Gordon holds on for dear life as the huge plane barely lifts
          off, veering sideways.
          
          
          EXT. CANYON/LAS VEGAS - DUSK
          
          The Antonov is on a collision course with the crumbling
          casino towers along the other side of the rim.
          
          
          INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DUSK
          
                                     SASHA
                    GOVNO! (shit). Help me pull!
          
          Gordon grabs the wheel on his side, helping Sasha pull up the
          beast of a plane.
          
          
          EXT. CANYON RIM/LAS VEGAS - DUSK
          
          Very slowly the plane starts to rise and Sasha's face lights
          up. They barely make it over a casino called `Paris; Las
          Vegas'.
          
          But the plane clips its wheels on a high metal structure
          right behind it, ripping away part of the landing gear.
          
          
          INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DUSK
          
          After some struggle, Sasha manages to steady the Antonov.
          Gordon's face is green as he looks back.
          
                                     GORDON
                    Was that the Eiffel Tower?
          
          Sasha looks over and grins. He grabs the microphone.

          EXT. YAK LA MONASTERY/TIBET - DAY
          
          An ancient monastery built atop a solitary mountain rock. In
          the distance, the sun glistens off the peaks of the
          Himalayas.
          
          NENG PANG, a young monk, 20, sits with his superior and
          teacher LAMA YAK LA, 65. They have tea beneath a huge bronze
          bell.
          
                                     LAMA YAK LA
                            (in Chinese)
                    Do not believe in anything simply
                    because you have heard it, Neng.
          
                                     NENG
                    But Lin is my brother. He is working
                    inside the big tunnels, where the ships
                    are made.
          
          The Lama remains silent.
          
                                     NENG (CONT'D)
                    What is in your wisdom for us to do,
                    great Lama... if Lin is right, if our
                    world is indeed coming to an end?
          
          Instead of answering, the Lama serves him more tea.
          
          When the cup is full, the Lama doesn't stop pouring. Neng
          watches the tea overflow until he can no longer restrain
          himself.
          
                                     NENG (CONT'D)
                    It's full, great Lama. It can hold no
                    more!
          
          The Lama stops pouring and looks at Neng.
          
                                     LAMA YAK LA
                    Like this cup, Neng, you are full of
                    your own opinions and speculations. How
                    can I show you wisdom unless you first
                    empty your cup?
          
          Neng bows his head in embarrassment.
          
          The Lama smiles to himself and takes a chain from around his
          neck. On it hangs a set of rusty car keys.
                                                             (CONTINUED)

                                     LAMA YAK LA (CONT'D)
                    Be careful with the clutch. It tends to
                    slide.
          
          The Lama throws him the keys and the young monk catches them,
          smiling from ear to ear. They bow to each other and Neng runs
          off.
          
          Lama Yak La looks after him as a father would. He gets up and
          strikes the bronze bell with a wooden mallet.
          
          
          EXT. HOUSING PROJECT/TIBET - DAY
          
          As far as you can see is a series of identical little houses.
          The house in the foreground has a chicken coop in the garden.
          
          Mrs. Pang enters the coop. We last saw her when the village
          was being evacuated. She grabs one of the hens. She places
          its head on a woodblock and picks up a rusty hatchet.
          
          Just about to strike, she hears a strange RATTLING noise.
          
          An old truck comes driving towards the house. Behind the
          wheel sits her son Neng. She puts down the hatchet, yelling.
          
                                     MRS. PANG
                            (in Chinese)
                    Bata! Neng is coming!
          
          The young monk jumps out, quickly bowing.
          
                                     NENG
                    Mother, I got a message from Lin. He
                    wants us to meet him in Cho Ming, at
                    the west gate. He says he can get us on
                    one of the ships he is working on.
          
          Mrs. Pang is still holding the chicken by its throat.
          
                                     MRS. PANG
                    I thought Lin is working on the dam?
          
                                     NENG
                    The dam is a ship, Mother. The
                    government lied to us. There will be a
                    big flood.
          
          The chicken hangs limp in Mrs. Pang's hand.
          
                                     MRS. PANG
                    Not here in the mountains... Let's eat
                    first.
          
          The hen panics as she puts its head back on the block,
          raising the hatchet again.

                    No mother! We must pack up right away.

                    We took a trip with the Laem Song ferry
                    once. Your father was throwing up the
                    whole way.
          
          The door opens and Mr. Pang appears.
          
                                     MR. PANG
                    Neng, I did not know you were coming
                    for dinner.
          
          At that moment the hatchet drops with a THUD!
          
                                                                 CUT TO:

                                     JACKSON
                    I guess... So tell me Mr. Karpov - how
                    much did you pay?
          
                                     YURI
                    One billion euro, per seat.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    That's disgusting.
          
                                     YURI
                    You know Curtis, I wasn't always
                    businessman. I am a boxer. Was my only
                    playing when I was a boy, back in
                    Murmansk. My coach...
                            (SMILING)
                    ... his name also Yuri... He always
                    said: `Someone wants to beat you... he
                    has to kill you first'.
          
          Yuri puts his hand on Jackson's shoulder.
          
                                     YURI (CONT'D)
                    What would you have done, if you rich
                    like me? Just look at your gorgeous
                    kids. And call me Yuri...
          
          Yuri offers his hand but Jackson doesn't shake it.
          
          Sasha's voice comes over the radio.
          
                                     SASHA (O.S.)
                    Hi guys. The plan is to refuel in
                    Hawaii. So, buckle up... Gordon and I
                    will do the rest.
          
          
          INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - NIGHT
          
          Gordon turns to Sasha.
          
          
                                                               (CONTINUED)

                                     GORDON
                    Let's get this straight, Sasha. I'm not
                    a pilot. I'm a plastic surgeon. I just
                    took some lessons to overcome my fear
                    of flying.
          
                                     SASHA
                    Why did you give up?
          
                                      GORDON
                    It didn't work.
          
          Gordon points to the declining altimeter.
          
                                     GORDON (CONT'D)
                    What about the wheels we lost at take-
                    off?
          
                                     SASHA
                    There's 14 on each side. Some of them
                    must still be there.
          
          With that, Sasha commences the landing procedure.
          
          
          EXT. ANTONOV/OVER HAWAII - NIGHT
          
          The Antonov dives into a thick layer of clouds.
          
                                     SASHA (O.S.)
                    Still nothing from the tower?
          
          
          INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - NIGHT
          
          Gordon shakes his head.
          
          The two pilots stare ahead watching as the clouds slowly
          change color, from yellow... to orange.
          
          They stare out the window in disbelief.
          
          
          INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - NIGHT
          
          Gordon comes climbing down the metal ladder whispering to
          Jackson and Yuri.
          
                                     GORDON
                    Guys, you really oughta take a look at
                    this.
          
          Jackson and Yuri follow Gordon back into the cockpit. The
          women exchange a worried glance.
          
                                                                       71.
          
          INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - NIGHT
          
          When Jackson and Yuri enter, they don't believe their eyes.
          
                                     YURI
                    What is that?
          
                                     SASHA
                    The State of Hawaii!
          
                                     YURI
                    Not good. That is not good.
          
          
          EXT. ANTONOV/OVER HAWAII - NIGHT
          
          From above we watch as the Antonov flies over an endless
          ocean of fiery red lava. The Islands of Hawaii have turned
          into one big volcano.
          
          
          INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - NIGHT
          
                                     JACKSON
                    How much fuel do we have?
          
                                     SASHA
                    Not enough. We'll have to make a water
                    landing somewhere in the South China
                    Sea.
          
                                     GORDON
                    At least we won't need our landing
                    gear.
          
          Yuri wonders.
          
                                     YURI
                    What about it?
          
                                     GORDON
                    We lost it all... in Vegas.
          
          
          EXT. ANTONOV/OVER HAWAII - NIGHT
          
          The damaged landing gear slowly retracts into the vast belly
          of the Antonov as it veers off to the east.
          
                                                                CUT TO:

          Adrian knocks quietly and sticks his head around the door.
          Laura is sitting in her father's chair.

                                       ADRIAN
                    Can I come in?
          
                                     LAURA
                    I've got nothing to say to you.
          
                                       ADRIAN
                    But I do...
          
          Adrian enters. He has his travel bag in one hand. He looks at
          Laura and gathers himself.
          
                                     ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    Your Dad and I... we were trying to
                    protect you.
          
                                     LAURA
                            (EXPLODING)
                    I'm a big girl Adrian. I don't need
                    protection. You used me. You guys had
                    me gallivanting around the world, as
                    part of your little cover-up.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    But you were doing a good job.
          
                                     LAURA
                    Sure, if your name's Da Vinci or
                    Picasso. But if you're some young
                    talent in Podunk, Texas, sorry you're
                    not famous enough. People like you and
                    Anheuser and my father - you think you
                    can play God.
          
          Adrian takes a moment, he's desperate to make her see.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    You know what your father believed.
                    That nature will choose itself from
                    itself.
          
                                     LAURA
                    That's bullshit and you know it. It's
                    the fittest, the richest and the
                    strongest that survive.
          
                                       ADRIAN
                    That's not true.
          
          Adrian glances down and spots Jackson's book poking out of
          his bag.

                                     ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    What would you say were the chances of
                    a first time, middle-aged writer, who
                    barely sold 500 copies of his novel
                    making it on board this plane?
          
                                     LAURA
                    Zero. What's your point?
          
          Adrian pulls out the book from his bag. He shows her.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    It's called `Farewell Atlantis' and
                    it's a fantastic read. It's part of our
                    legacy now.
          
          Laura takes this in. The plane's intercom cuts through the
          moment.
          
                                     INTERCOM (O.S.)
                    Mr. Helmsley, Prof. West requests your
                    presence immediately.
          
          Adrian takes a breath, but before he leaves -
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    What if I tried to sort some of this
                    mess out? I need to know you can
                    forgive me...
          
          Laura looks at him sadly, but with a little hope.
          
                                     LAURA
                    I need to know that too, Adrian.
          
          Adrian moves for the door. He stops.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    One more thing. Your father told me you
                    were the most precious thing to him in
                    the whole world... You are to me too.
          
          As Adrian exits, we hold on Laura's conflicted face.
          
                                                                  CUT TO:

          The cloud from the Yellowstone eruption has hit Washington
          D.C. hard. Pennsylvania Avenue resembles a war zone. A ten
          inch layer of ash lies on the ground.
          
          The gates of the White House are wide open, with ash-covered
          rescue workers running about, resembling ghosts.
          
                                                                     74.
          
          INT. WEST WING/WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          The President has turned the whole West Wing into a shelter.
          He walks through the packed rooms assisting where he can.
          
          An old African-American LADY holds a crying young girl.
          President Wilson kneels down to her.
          
                                     OLD LADY
                    She can't find her mother.
          
                                     PRESIDENT
                    Why don't you two girls make yourself
                    comfy on that big couch? I'll see what
                    I can do.
          
          The child nods. The President gets up.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON
                    Sally, can you take care of them. I'll
                    go check with the Red Cross...
          
          As he leaves, the old lady looks up at Sally and smiles.
          
                                     OLD LADY
                    No wonder the First Lady fell for him.
                    I knew Miss Dorothy Jones long before
                    the President, when she was still
                    singing jazz down in Atlanta with Harry
                    Helmsley.
          
                                     SALLY
                    I know, she was amazing.
          
          
          EXT. FRONT LAWN/WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          The President walks up to the Red Cross tents placed on the
          front lawn. He stops one of the Red Cross volunteers.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON
                    Who can help me with missing persons?
          
          Without looking up, the young guy responds.
          
                                     RED CROSS VOLUNTEER
                    Sorry man, I'm busy right now.
          
          He then recognizes who he's talking to.
          
                                     RED CROSS VOLUNTEER (CONT'D)
                    I mean, of course sir. I didn't
                    realize... What can I do for you, Mr.
                    President?
          
          The President pats him on the shoulder.

                    Don't worry about it. You're doing a
                    great job son...
          
          A deep, low rumble begins, stopping everybody in place.
          
          As it builds, the President grabs onto a tent pole to secure
          himself. He looks out over Washington D.C. His eyes grow
          wide...
          
          The National Mall bends like rubber. The towering Washington
          Monument breaks into pieces.
          
          An even more deafening sound makes him turn--
          
          The Capitol Building rises from behind the trees, lifted up
          by earth's incredible force.
          
          As the whole building breaks apart, the President is thrown
          to the ground.

          She stands there frozen, emotionless. She looks over to
          Anheuser, who is shouting orders. Another officer hands him a
          phone.

                    just entered Chinese air space.
          
          Anheuser takes the phone and after a beat answers.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    That's affirmative, Mr. President.
                    Until communication is restored, I am

          Pope Benedict XVI holds mass in St. Peter's Basilica.
          Millions of followers flood Vatican City. It's a sea of
          candles.
          
          Amidst the mass of believers we see the Italian Prime
          Minister Antonioni with his family clinging to him. They all
          are praying.
          
          A low RUMBLE. People look around frightened. In the distance
          we hear SCREAMING.

          A few cardinals huddle together in silent prayer under
          Michelangelo's famous fresco. Most prominent above them is
          `The Creation of Adam'.
          
          The cardinals look up in horror as the rumbling intensifies.
          A crack forms on the ceiling, shooting straight through God
          touching the finger of Adam.
          
          Then the whole fresco breaks apart.

          The people in St. Peter's square begin to panic--
          
          The entire Vatican is lifted up in the air. We hold on the
          Prime Minister and his family, as the basilica collapses onto
          the fleeing masses.

          The steering wheel is vibrating badly in his hands as he
          slides the clutch and downshifts. As the vehicle slows on the
          steep incline, the vibrations become much worse. Neng worries
          that the truck may be breaking down.
          
          He pulls up and switches off the engine but to his surprise
          the steering wheel continues to vibrate.
          
          Looking out the windshield, he sees the whole earth shaking

          A monstrous tidal wave rises from the desert sands thundering
          towards them.

          President Wilson's body lays between the rubble. As he slowly
          regains consciousness, all he can hear is the flapping sound
          of the collapsed Red Cross tents.

          As President Wilson gets to his feet, he sees--
          
          A tidal wave come sweeping over the remains of the Washington
          Mall and it carries with it the battleships of the 14th Fleet
          of the US Navy that were anchored in Chesapeake Bay.
          
          The President looks ahead, calm and peaceful.

          Hushed voices. Anheuser, Adrian and Prof. West stand amongst
          a group of officers and analysts.

                    The only signal our satellites are

                                     ANHEUSER
                    At least some good news.
          
          Anheuser turns to Adrian.

                    Would our science advisor care to give
                    us his assessment?

                    We expect enormous tsunamis to reach
                    landfall in every continent. The Cho

          He nods to one of the analysts, who types in a couple of
          commands.

                    So Helmsley, what you're telling us
                    here is that... the north pole is now
                    somewhere in Wisconsin?
          
          Silence. Adrian clears his throat.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    It's the south pole, sir.

          Jackson's family are all asleep in their seats, Lilly in her
          mom's lap. She looks like a little angel. Jackson can't bear
          to wake them. He caresses Lilly's face.
          
                                     NOAH (O.S.)

          Jackson turns to see Noah is awake.

                                     JACKSON
                    What are you talking about? I don't
                    hate Gordon.
          
                                     NOAH
                    But you don't like him either.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    I don't know him that well.
          
                                     NOAH
                    But I know him. He's really nice. You
                    should talk to him more often. You guys
                    would get along really well.
          
          This breaks Jackson's heart. He pulls Noah tightly to his
          chest.
          
                                     JACKSON

          On the opposite side of the aircraft, Yuri and Tamara help
          the twins get into their life vests. Noah is suspicious.

          Jackson looks at his kids. They both look scared.

                    Sasha told us, it could get a little

          In the background, Gordon climbs down from the cockpit. He is
          about to speak when he hears Jackson's voice.
          
                                     JACKSON (CONT'D)
                    I know that with my writing and work I
                    didn't have a lot of time for you
                    both...
          
          Jackson glances at Kate.
          
                                     JACKSON (CONT'D)
                    I wasn't there for you, the way I
                    should have been.
          
          Jackson looks Kate directly in the eyes.

                    ... And I am so very sorry for that.
          
          Gordon watches as Kate pulls the kids and Jackson tight. For
          the first time, they seem a little like the family they once
          were.

          The plane drops rapidly, nearly scraping the tip of a
          mountain. Sasha and Gordon are doing all they can to keep the
          Antonov in the air.

          INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DAWN
          
          Sasha barely holds on. He yells at Gordon.
          
                                     SASHA
                    Your turn Gordon! Go! Make sure that
                    they make it out of here before I touch
                    down!
          
                                       GORDON
                    What about you?!
          
                                     SASHA
                    I'll be fine! I have to land this
                    thing!
          
          Gordon hesitates.
          
                                     SASHA (CONT'D)
                    What are you waiting for!

          Sasha nods at him reassuringly. Gordon bolts out.
          
          
          INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DAWN
          
          The cargo door scrapes against the glacier, hurling ice
          everywhere. The Bentley roars.
          
                                      YURI (O.S.)
                    Push it Curtis!
          
                                     JACKSON
                    We're waiting for Sasha and Gordon.
          
          Noah turns and sees Gordon.
          
                                     NOAH
                    Tamara! Open the door!
          
          Gordon jumps in. Tamara yells at him in desperation.
          
                                      TAMARA
                    Where's Sasha?
          
                                     GORDON
                    He said he'll be fine and we should get
                    out of here before he touches down.
          
          Yuri notices Tamara's distress as she keeps looking back to
          the cockpit. Jackson slams the pedal down trying to gain as
          much speed as possible to soften their landing.
          
                                      LILLY
                    Daaadddy!
          
          The Bentley shoots out the back of the plane. As it hits the
          snow, the air bags deploy cushioning the passengers.
          
          The Antonov hits the ice and catapults the rest of the luxury
          cars out of the back cargo hold. They barrel past the Bentley
          like skittles, narrowly missing it as they fly off in
          opposite directions.
          
          The plane skids across the glacier, clipping its wing and
          causing the aircraft to break apart.
          
          Sasha has no control anymore and watches helplessly as he
          shoots towards the ledge in the Antonov, plunging into the
          deep.
          
          The plane crashes and explodes.
          
                                                                       88.
          
          EXT. GLACIER/TIBET - DAWN
          
          As the snow settles we see that the glacier is scattered with
          luxury cars tomb-stoned in the snow.
          
          The Bentley is half buried. We hear Caesar barking.
          
                                     JACKSON (O.S.)
                    Everybody okay back there?
          
                                      KATE (O.S.)
                    We're all fine.
          
          The door opens and Jackson climbs out, looking around. Just
          above the wind, he hears the SOUND OF HELICOPTER BLADES.
          
          One by one the others appear behind Jackson and stare at a
          surreal sight--
          
          Several Chinese Mil-26 choppers airlift animals over the
          mountain pass.
          
          GIRAFFES, ZEBRAS, EVEN ELEPHANTS hang by huge straps from
          these flying machines.
          
          One of the smaller helicopters veers from the transport fleet
          and lands near the Bentley.
          
          Armed soldiers jump out. Their Commander speaks to them in a
          sharp tone.
          
                                     CHINESE COMMANDER
                    Welcome to the People's Republic of
                    China.
          
          Jackson nods to them.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Thank you...
                            (to Lilly and Noah)
                    Say thank you, kids.
          
          The others acknowledge the soldiers as well. Hi... Hello...
          
                                     CHINESE COMMANDER
                    What color are your passes?
          
          Jackson stands dumbfounded. The Commander repeats.
          
                                     CHINESE COMMANDER (CONT'D)
                    What color are your boarding passes?
          
          Still no answer. He yells an order. The soldiers point their
          guns at them.
          
          
                                                               (CONTINUED)

                    I have green card.
          
          Surprised, Jackson turns to Yuri who's holding up three green
          plastic cards.
          
                                     YURI (CONT'D)
                    For my boys and me.
          
          Tamara can't believe what she's hearing.
          
                                     TAMARA
                    It's a joke... a mistake...
                            (LAUGHING)
                    Right Yuri?
          
          Yuri shrugs. Tamara lunges at him.
          
                                     TAMARA (CONT'D)
                            (in Russian)
                    You disgust me. You pig.
          
          Yuri brushes her off, coldly. And then speaks so they can all
          understand him.
          
                                     YURI
                    You think I did not know about you and
                    Sasha? May god rest that poor bastard's
                    soul.
          
          With that Yuri turns to the others.
          
                                     YURI (CONT'D)
                    I am sorry guys. Good luck. And Jackson
                    remember, if someone wants to beat
                    you... he has to kill you first. Come
                    boys!
          
          The twins grab Caesar and climb into the helicopter. The dog
          barks furiously, wanting to stay with Tamara.
          
          The next moment, the helicopter takes off.
          
                                     GORDON
                    What!... Did that just happen!?
          
          They're stranded.
          
                                                                CUT TO:

          Air Force One is in the background as Laura, Anheuser, and
          other members of the crew are rushed towards a group of
          waiting helicopters.

          Adrian is a little way back in the middle of the pack. A
          Chinese Officer with a list shouts over the noise.
          
                                     CHINESE OFFICER
                            (POINTING)
                    Mr. Anheuser - you're in Chopper 1. Dr.
                    Wilson the same.
          
          Laura and Anheuser reach the chopper. An authoritative Naval
          Officer greets them, and raises his voice.
          
                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS
                    I'm Captain Richard Michaels. I'm the
                    skipper of the American boat sir. After
                    you!
          
          Anheuser nods and climbs in the chopper. Captain Michaels
          helps Laura in. Adrian arrives just as the Chopper door
          slides shut and it lifts off.
          
          
          INT. HELICOPTER/CHO MING VALLEY/TIBET - DAWN
          
          Laura catches Adrian's look of unease before they soar away.
          
                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS
                    My sincerest condolences Dr. Wilson,
                    for your father...
          
          Laura's look thanks him for this. He turns to Anheuser.
          
                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS (CONT'D)
                    Your party is the last to arrive.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    I've been told of damages?
          
                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS
                    We haven't completed the assessment but
                    it looks like we lost Number 4 when the
                    crust shifted.
          
          Captain Michaels looks up and points into the distance.
          
                                    CAPTAIN MICHAELS (CONT'D)

          EXT. CHO MING VALLEY/TIBET - DAWN
          
          The CAMERA follows the choppers revealing--
          
          Nine gigantic oval gates that measure at least 60 stories,
          built into the face of a mountain.

          In front of every gate there is a line of huge `Y' shaped
          metal support structures, which are the launching towers for
          the ships. They are each at least 800 feet high. It's an
          unparalleled feat of engineering.
          
          
          EXT. CHOPPER/CHO MING VALLEY - DAWN
          
          The lead chopper descends onto a platform in front of one of
          the gates, dwarfed against this majestic setting.
          
          The door slides open and Anheuser jumps out. Laura follows.
          She looks around in awe.
          
          Even the utility entrances that lead into the mountain are
          immense. The Captain guides them into the hollow mountain.
          
          In the BACKGROUND we see an angry Yuri scream and argue with
          military personnel, waving his tickets.

                    Can you read? Now get the hell back
                    with the other green cards, or I'll
                    have you detained.
          
          The twins stand nearby, holding Caesar. They look afraid.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:

          Jackson and his group are small specks in a barren landscape.
          They have made it down the glacier and are now walking over a
          scree field.
          
          It is hard going. Jackson carries Lilly.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Keep thinking warm thoughts sweetheart.

          Kate holds Noah by the hand. Gordon and Tamara trail behind.
          She's still very upset.
          
                                     TAMARA
                    I should have listened to you, Dr.
                    Silberman. I actually liked the way I
                    looked before that monster talked me
                    into it.

                    Did you know he asked for a discount...
                    and he paid in installments?
          
                                     TAMARA
                    Cheap bastard.

                    You're better off without him. What he
                    said about you and Sasha, is it true?
          
          Tamara nods silently.

                    Now that he's gone I think he was worth
                    a hundred times a man like Yuri.
          
          Suddenly they hear the PUTTERING of an engine.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    You guys hear that?
          
          In the distance, an old rusty truck comes bumping down the
          dirt road. Jackson puts down Lilly and chases after it.
          
          
          EXT. DIRT ROAD/NEAR CHO MING - DAWN
          
          Neng and his parents drive past, billowing a huge cloud of
          dust just as Jackson reaches the road.
          
                                     JACKSON
                            (out of breath)
                    Hey! Help! Wait for us!
          
          But Neng doesn't hear him over the rattling truck. Jackson,
          pissed, kicks at the rocks on the road.
          
                                     JACKSON (CONT'D)
                    Shit! Shit!
          
          Just then, Neng's mother, sitting in the back of the truck,
          turns and sees his tantrum. She bangs on the rear window of
          the cabin.
          
          Neng looks in the mirror and hits the brakes. Jackson can't
          believe his luck.

          The others show up and they all run towards the truck.
          
                                                                   CUT TO:

          Anheuser and Laura follow Captain Michaels and a Chinese
          Steward over one of the many boarding bridges erected inside
          the cavernous mountain that lead to one of the monstrous
          arks. Laura stops halfway, gazing in awe--
          
          Deep down below, thousands of workers are swarming over the
          ship, readying it for launch.
          
          Laura looks up and sees the contrast, spotting the SHEIK we
          met in the Dorchester Hotel as he boards comfortably with his
          huge family.
          
          Laura points down at the workers.
          
                                     LAURA
                    Captain Michaels? What happens to all
                    those people?
          
          The Captain doesn't know what to say. Anheuser turns.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    Dr. Wilson, there's a protocol for all
                    that. You just stick to your art. We'll
                    handle the rest.
          
          Laura hates him in that moment.
          
                                     ANHEUSER (CONT'D)
                    Captain? Where is the Bridge?
          
          Anheuser and Captain Michaels move away as Laura stands and
          watches the frantic workers who are now boarding the animals
          we saw being airlifted over the mountains.
          
                                     CHINESE STEWARD (O.S.)
                    Dr. Wilson? Your cabin is this way.
          
          Laura has a look of guilt as she follows the steward.
          
                                                                   CUT TO:

          Thousands are on the march up the mountains. Behind them a
          valley stretches into the horizon. Plumes of smoke rise from
          destroyed cities in the distance.

          Amongst the refugees, we discover Satnam, the young
          astrophysicist, holding his little son. The rest of Satnam's
          family trails behind.
          
          Distant WARNING SIRENS pierce the silent march, coming from
          the cities below.
          
          People start to scream and run, but Satnam stands there
          frozen. He fumbles for his satellite phone, then hits a
          number on its speed dial.
          
          
          INT. LIVING QUARTERS/AMERICAN SHIP - SUNRISE
          
          Adrian is unpacking. He lays down his copy of `Farewell
          Atlantis' just as his cell phone rings.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Satnam?
                            (CONFUSED)
                    Where are you?
          
                                     SATNAM (O.S.)
                    On the Nampan Plateau...
          
          Adrian's face goes pale.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    What?!
          
                                     SATNAM
                    There's a tidal wave coming from the
                    East! It's huge!
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Satnam, what happened?
          
                                     SATNAM (O.S.)
                    We never got picked up, Adrian, the
                    airlift never came!
          
          Adrian closes his eyes.
          
          
          EXT. NAMPAN MOUNTAINS/EAST COAST OF INDIA - SUNRISE
          
          Satnam swallows hard. He stares out into the valley.
          
                                     SATNAM
                    I have to go!
          
          A wall of undulating foam and debris comes rolling towards
          him. A tidal wave of gigantic height.
          
          Everybody panics and scratches for a higher elevation. But
          for Satnam it is clear, they do not stand a chance.

          He picks up his little son, squeezing him tightly to his
          chest, humming an Indian lullaby for the scared child.

          Adrian hears SCREAMING on the phone and the deafening sound
          of the approaching wave. He tenses up, desperate but unable
          to do anything.
          
          As the noise reaches its height, the line goes dead. Adrian
          is left breathless.

          Adrian storms onto the bridge. Many officers and analysts are

                    Do we have the latest satellite images

                                       SCIENCE OFFICER
                    One moment, sir.
          
          Anheuser and Prof. West step over and join him.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    Helmsley, what's going on here?
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Looks like our model was wrong.
          
          They all stare at the monitor showing several tidal waves
          coming in from the south.
          
                                     ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    Satnam was talking about a wave from
                    the East.
          
          A science officer selects a different quadrant on the
          satellite display. They all stare at the new tidal wave
          that's coming from the East of the Cho Ming valley.
          
                                       PROF. WEST
                    Jesus!
          
          Anheuser is shocked.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    What does this mean?

                    The flooding will happen earlier.
                    Bobby, can you plug in the new data
                    please?
          
          As the officer does this, Prof. West looks at Adrian with
          questioning eyes.
          
                                     ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    Satnam didn't get picked up.
          
          Prof. West is horrified.
          
                                     SCIENCE OFFICER (O.S.)
                    Ready sir.
          
          Adrian turns back to the monitor and sees the new tidal wave
          that is coming towards the Cho Ming valley.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    This one is at least 1500    meters high!
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    Talk to me Helmsley. What does this
                    mean for us?
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Bobby, plug in the new data and adjust
                    the count down?
          
          Every one on the bridge stares at a display. It reads--
          
          02hrs - 09min - 07sec
          
          The science officer nervously hits a few keys and the display
          changes to--
          
          00hrs - 28min - 10sec... and counting.
          
          We see the shock on Anheuser's face.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    Get me the other Heads of State.

          Neng's truck, loaded with Jackson and the others, creeps up
          to the service entrance of the launch site.
          
          A lone figure awaits them. This is Neng's older brother Lin,
          who we saw signing up for the 'Chinese Dam Project'.
          
          Lin notices the strangers in the pick-up truck.

                    Who are they?
          
          Neng answers hesitantly.
          
                                     NENG
                    We found them by the side of the road,
                    my brother.
          
                                     LIN
                    You must send them back.
          
                                     NENG
                    I am a follower of the great Lama Yak
                    La. You know I cannot do that.
          
          The others watch the interaction but do not understand.
          Jackson senses a problem. He grabs Lilly and Noah.
          
                                       JACKSON
                    Come with daddy.
          
          Gordon and Tamara stare perplexed as Jackson approaches Lin
          with his kids.
          
                                     JACKSON (CONT'D)
                    At least take our children with you.
                    Please.
          
          Lin answers in broken English.
          
                                     LIN
                    Why should I do that?
          
                                     JACKSON
                    For the same reason you sent for your
                    parents.
          
          Lin stares at him stone faced. In desperation, Kate turns to
          Mrs. Pang.
          
                                     KATE
                    I have no clue if you understand what
                    I'm saying, but I ask you as a mother,
                    please take my kids with you!
          
          Silence. A beat. The old Chinese lady turns to Lin.
          
                                     MRS. PANG
                            (in Chinese)
                    We are all children of this earth.
          
                                     LIN
                    My plan will not work for so many,
                    mother.

          She looks up at her son, determined.
          
                                     MRS. PANG
                    We will take them all. Bata?
          
          Mr. Pang nods and reluctantly, Lin motions to Jackson to
          follow. Kate bows to Mrs. Pang.
          
                                     KATE
                    Thank you ma'am. Thank you so much.
          
          Jackson and the others acknowledge what Kate has done.
          
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. SHIP BAY/CHO MING - EARLY MORNING
          
          We finally reveal the unbelievable magnitude of this ship
          yard, built into the hollow belly of the mountains.
          
          Nine gargantuan vessels are lined up next to each other.
          Their size is at least four times that of the `Freedom of the
          Seas'. However, they look more like spaceships than anything,
          having been built aerodynamically to withstand the full force
          of nature.
          
          But only three of these monstrous ARKS are complete. Number 4
          is being repaired, all the others are still under
          construction, surrounded by scaffolding.
          
          Suddenly SIRENS goes off!
          
          The boarding bridges to the finished vessels begin to
          retract. There's growing confusion among the thousands of
          workers and security personnel.
          
          
          INT. PLATFORM, SHIP BAY/CHO MING - EARLY MORNING
          
          Opposite the boarding bridges, on a large platform, Yuri and
          his boys sit in line with the other waiting passengers.
          
          They watch as massive stern gates begin to close. Yuri jumps
          up and yells to the others.
          
                                     YURI
                    They're leaving without us!
          
          The soldier from earlier points his gun at him.
          
                                     SOLDIER
                    What did I tell you!
          
          Caesar barks at the guy.
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                       99.
          
                                     YURI
                            (POINTING)
                    Look! Idiot! They are leaving you
                    behind too!
          
          The soldier turns to the ships and Yuri knocks him out. He
          grabs his boys and runs towards the closing gates. All the
          other passengers surge forward with him.
          
          In the distance, on the bow side of the ships, the huge
          mountain gates of the bay open, revealing a stunning view of
          Cho Ming Valley.
          
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. MOUNTAIN RIDGE/CHO MING - MORNING
          
          Lin leads his group over a ridge. In front of their eyes--
          
          The gates to the mountain open!
          
                                     LIN
                            (in Chinese)
                    We have to hurry!
                            (to Jackson)
                    They launch! We run out of time!
          
          They follow Lin rushing down the hill, towards one of the
          many Y-shaped launch structures towering in front of the
          gates. Neng and Kate help Mr. and Mrs. Pang down the rocky
          terrain.
          
          
          INT. SHIP BAY/CHO MING - MORNING
          
          A screeching and thundering noise!
          
          THE THREE COMPLETED VESSELS BEGIN TO INCH FORWARD on metal
          girders connecting the Y-shaped launch towers.
          
          
          INT. LIVING QUARTERS/AMERICAN SHIP - MORNING
          
          Laura feels a jolt. She rushes out of her small cabin and
          into a swarm of people moving down a crammed endless
          corridor. She struggles to fight her way through.
          
          A digital voice blares over the speakers.
          
                                     COMPUTER VOICE
                    Countdown to departure. Launch in 17
                    minutes - 42 seconds.
          
          Laura bumps into one of Adrian's Science Officers.
          
                                                               (CONTINUED)

                                     LAURA
                    Where can I find Adrian Helmsley?
          
                                     SCIENCE OFFICER
                    He's in the Technical Command Centre.

          EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - MORNING
          
          The three gigantic vessels emerge from the mountain, into the
          open. Support helicopters swarm around them like flies.
          
          
          EXT. BENEATH A LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO-MING - MORNING
          
          Lin and his group look like ants as they scale the metal
          ladders of one of the launch towers.
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - MORNING
          
          Verbal commands fly back and forth. Anheuser watches the
          preparations from a large window.
          
          He looks over to the command bridges of the other vessels as
          they continue to be pulled into place.
          
          
          INT. COMMAND BRIDGES/OTHER SHIPS - MORNING
          
          We cut to the various Heads of State, all at their command
          posts.
          
          
          EXT. TOP OF LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO MING - MORNING
          
          A hatch opens at the top of the launch tower. Lin is the
          first to climb out.
          
          Right before his eyes, the hull of the American Ship slowly
          creeps towards him. He's but a speck against this man-made
          behemoth.
          
          Lin hastily pulls the others up.
          
                                     LIN
                            (in Chinese)
                    Faster, Neng! Help father! Mother, give
                    me your hand.
          
          It's a race against time. The huge ship's hull closes in
          fast. Lin and his family crawl up the side arm while Jackson
          hurries to pull up the rest of the group.
          
          Lilly freezes at the sight of the approaching ship.
                                                             (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                      101.
          
                                    JACKSON
                    Move Lil'bee!
          
          Jackson rips her out of harm's way, just in time. In a
          frenzy, he pushes her up the support arm where the others are
          already huddled on a small platform.
          
          As the towering wall of steel passes by them, inches from
          their faces, Mr. Pang loses his balance. Jackson and Lin both
          see this, but Jackson is closer--
          
          He grabs the old man by his arm, saving him from falling to
          his death.
          
          For the first time, Lin acknowledges Jackson with a nod.
          
          
          EXT. SHIP BAY/CHO MING SITE - MORNING
          
          The three completed ships are half way out, grinding to their
          final launching position.
          
          A mob of passengers led by Yuri has fought their way to the
          ship. More and more people join them, including soldiers.
          
          
          EXT. TOP OF LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO MING - MORNING
          
          Lin, Jackson and the group are huddled on the platform.
          
          The sound of SCREAMING PEOPLE makes them turn. The storming
          masses have arrived at the access platform. There is now a
          huge drop off between them and the tails of the ships.
          
                                     TAMARA
                            (POINTING)
                    Oh my god, that's Yuri!
          
          Next to Yuri are his twins, holding Caesar. She yells!
          
                                    TAMARA (CONT'D)
                    Caesar!
          
          
          EXT. ACCESS PLATFORM/CHO MING SITE - MORNING
          
          The little dog hears Tamara and jumps out of Oleg's arms,
          leaping onto one of the thick cables, that connects the
          platform with the launching towers.
          
          Alec and Oleg attempt to run after Caesar, but Yuri grabs
          them by their necks.
          
                                     YURI
                    Let that stupid dog go!
          
                                                            (CONTINUED)

          He's panicked. The arriving masses are pushing them to the
          drop off at the edge of the platform.
          
          
          EXT. TOP OF LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO MING - MORNING
          
          The ship has reached its targeted position. A small hatch
          lines up directly in front of Lin and his group.
          
                                     LIN
                            (in Chinese)
                    Okay. Now!
          
          One by one they all climb into the hatch. Jackson being the
          last in, notices that Tamara has stayed back.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Tamara! Come on! Get in!
          
          She doesn't move, anxiously waiting for her beloved dog
          darting towards her.
          
          
          EXT. ACCESS PLATFORM/CHO MING SITE - MORNING
          
          The mob pushes at Yuri and his boys. Passengers on either
          side tumble off the platform.
          
          Yuri watches one of them fall, hitting his head against a
          tiny ledge 8 feet below. To his right, he sees a small ladder
          leading down.
          
                                     YURI
                            (in Russian)
                    Down there! Oleg, you go first!
          
          As they hurry down the ladder, people keep tumbling into the
          deep. Reaching the ledge, Oleg discovers Caesar running
          towards Tamara.
          
                                     OLEG
                    Daddy look, Tamara!
          
          Yuri cannot believe his eyes.
          
          
          EXT. TOP OF LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO MING SITE - MORNING
          
          The hatch behind Tamara begins to move. The hydraulic
          supports are being lifted, sealing up the vessel.
          
                                      TAMARA
                    Caesar darling!
          
          Jackson reaches out from the closing hatch.

                                      JACKSON
                    Tamara! Get in!
          
          Tamara climbs inside the hatch and turns.
          
                                      TAMARA
                    Come to mommy!
          
          Caesar leaps into her arms only seconds before the hatch
          seals. As a last gesture, Tamara sticks out her arm and gives
          Yuri the finger.

          Lin leads the group into a long and narrow chamber where the
          hydraulics for the tail gate are located.
          
          He opens a tool cabinet, retrieving a giant electrical power
          drill, almost too big to be carried by one person.
          
          Lin climbs to a hatch near the ceiling and begins to unscrew
          the huge bolts. He looks at Jackson.
          
                                     LIN
                    I need your help.

          Center. She finds Adrian staring at a wall of monitors
          showing the horrifying scenario on the platforms.
          
          People are falling to their deaths in large numbers in their
          desperation to board the ship.
          
                                     LAURA
                    What in god's name is happening Adrian?

                    Anheuser convinced them all to launch.
          
          Outside, panicking workers, screaming for their life!
          Deserted passengers waving their green cards!

          With that, Adrian turns to the Communication Officer.

          The officer hesitates as Laura enters in the background.

                    Can you please turn up the volume, Mr.
                    Hoffmann?
          
          Next to her stand the British and French Prime Ministers.
          
                                     ADRIAN (O.S.)
                    I know we've all been involved in
                    making difficult decisions... to save
                    our human civilization...
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Anheuser looks on stoney faced.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    ... But to be human means to care for
                    each other, and civilization means to
                    work together to create a better life.
                    If that's true there is nothing human
                    and nothing civilized about what we're
                    doing here. Ask yourselves ... Can we
                    really stand by and let all those
                    people out there die?
          
          Laura watches him proudly.

                                      ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                     A civilization that allows that, does
                     not deserve to survive.
                             (PAUSE)
                     Or at least I don't want to be part of
                     it.
          
          Anheuser cuts in with sarcasm.
          
                                      ANHEUSER
                     We'll miss you Helmsley but somehow
                     we'll get by. Officer switch that off.
          
          The Communications Officer looks at Adrian.
          
                                      ANHEUSER (CONT'D)
                     That's an order soldier.
          
                                       ADRIAN
                     Don't do it!
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE/ASIAN SHIP - DAY
          
          The Russian President, together with the heads of state from
          China and Japan, listen in as Adrian responds.
          
                                      ADRIAN (O.S.)
                     We have to open our gates and let these
                     people in. All of them.
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Anheuser has had enough.
          
                                      ANHEUSER
                     Have you lost your mind? Look at the
                     countdown. We have less than five
                     minutes left... And none of our ships
                     have the resources to feed those
                     people. If you save them today we all
                     starve tomorrow.
          
          He's almost screaming now.
          
                                      ANHEUSER (CONT'D)
                     Do you wanna be responsible for the
                     extinction of the human race? Can you
                     handle that, Adrian?!
          
          Silence.
          
          Adrian's battle seems lost. But he doesn't give up, and
          instead speaks softly now.
          
                                                               (CONTINUED)

                                     ADRIAN
                    There is a young astrophysicist from
                    India who is the reason we are all
                    here, trying to give mankind a second
                    chance. He's the one who discovered it
                    all, the one who connected the dots. We
                    all owe him our lives.
          
          All eyes are glued to Adrian.
          
                                     ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    I just learned that he was killed with
                    his family by a tsunami in eastern
                    India. You know why?
          
          Adrian stares Anheuser in the eyes as he continues.
          
                                     ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    He died because we forgot to pick him
                    up.
                            (PAUSE)
                    I beg you... whatever our future holds
                    don't let us start it with an act of
                    cruelty. What will you tell your
                    children... and their children?
          
          Silence. Laura steps up alongside Adrian.
          
                                     LAURA
                    If my father were here, he would open
                    the gates.
          
          Adrian and Laura share a look.
          
                                     RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (O.S.)

          INT. BRIDGE/ASIAN SHIP - DAY
          
          His Asian colleagues nod in approval.
          
                                     RUSSIAN PRESIDENT
                    ... China and Japan agree to open the
                    gates.

          The German Chancellor speaks up.
          
                                     GERMAN CHANCELLOR
                    The United Kingdom, Spain, France and
                    Germany, and I believe I can also speak
                    for the Italian Prime Minister...
          
                                                                    107.

                    ... We vote to open the gates.
          
          Laura and Adrian watch Anheuser shaking his head in defeat.
          Bobby, the Communications Officer smiles with relief. Adrian
          turns to the Captain.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Captain Michaels, you heard them.
          
          
          EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - DAY
          
          One by one the gigantic gates at the stern of the three ships
          begin to creek open.
          
          The masses gathered on the platform CHEER wildly!
          
          
          INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Lilly crawls through the CONNECTING TUNNEL meeting up with
          Kate in a large bay on the other side.
          
                                     LILLY
                    Phew... It stinks in here.
          
          Together with Neng and his parents, they all look up in
          DISBELIEF--
          
          A Giraffe, chewing her cud, smiles down at them. Caesar barks
          at her.
          
                                     TAMARA
                    Sssh...Caesar.
          
          A second later, hundreds of different ANIMALS RESPOND. They
          are in the zoological bay.
          
          
          INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Gordon helps Noah up the small ladder leading to the
          connecting tunnel.
          
          Just as he goes to hand him Jackson's backpack, the HYDRAULIC
          MOTORS begin to GROWL! Lin looks up in panic. He screams.
          
                                     LIN
                    They're opening the gate! It will crush
                    us!
          
          The whole ceiling begins to lower towards them. From down
          below, Jackson sees his son about to be hit by it.

                                       JACKSON
                    Noah! Watch out!
          
          Gordon makes a split second decision. With all his strength,
          he shoves the boy into the tunnel.
          
          
          INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          From the other side of the tunnel, Kate watches as the metal
          ceiling misses Noah by a hair, but catches Gordon, wiping him
          off the ladder.
          
                                       KATE
                    No!
          
          
          INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Jackson watches helplessly as Gordon falls past him. He
          survives his landing and desperately tries to grab on to the
          sloping surface, but he can't. He slips.
          
          Gordon is crushed between the gears, sharing his last look
          with Jackson before he dies.
          
          
          INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Kate helps a trembling Noah out of the tunnel.
          
                                     NOAH
                    Something happened, mom.
          
          Kate pulls him close and shuts her eyes tightly. She fights
          back the tears.
          
          
          INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Jackson and Lin know they're running out of time, their
          remaining space is shrinking every second.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    We have to stop it!
          
          Lin grabs the huge electrical power drill nearby and attempts
          to jam it between the hydraulic arm and the wall.
          
          As it digs deeper into the metal, the hydraulic starts to
          slow down.
          
                                                                      109.

          Still on the ledge, Yuri and the boys watch as the huge
          boarding gate lowers towards them. They are trapped.
          
          Just then, the gates begin to slow, but surely they will be
          crushed.
          
          
          INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Back in the chamber, Lin still struggles with the drill.
          Suddenly he slips.
          
          Jackson manages to catch his fall. But in the process Lin's
          foot gets caught between the gears, mangling it.
          
          He screams in pain as the hydraulic slowly grinds towards a
          halt.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    You did it, man. You did it.
          
          In great pain, Lin grins back at him.
          
          
          EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - DAY
          
          The gates of the ships hit the access platform with a
          thundering noise. People begin to rush on board.
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Alarm signals go off. The Captain turns to one of his
          officers.
          
                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS
                    What's wrong with the gate?
          
                                     OFFICER
                    I don't know. Maybe there's something
                    jamming it, sir.
          
          The countdown on the monitor reads 2 min. 40 sec. Laura and
          Adrian share a worried look.
          
          We hear a HOLLOW BELL ring!
          
                                                                  CUT TO:

          The booming sound echoes through the Cho Ming valley. As a
          gentle wind catches the Lama's clothes, he looks up--
          
          A tidal wave of immeasurable proportion crests the mountains.
          
          The Lama continues to strike the bell as the monastery is
          wiped clean from the earth.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:

          An officer waves Adrian over.
          
                                     SURVEILLANCE OFFICER
                    Sir, we have a breach in the zoological

                    Can you zoom in?
          
          The video camera moves in on Kate, Noah and Lilly. Adrian
          can't believe his eyes. He turns to Laura.
          
                                     ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    I know those kids. Remember the book I
                    told you about? Their father wrote it.
          
          Captain Michaels shouts across the room.
          
                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS
                    We're loaded. We can close the gates
                    sir.

          Anheuser looks nervously at the countdown. It reads 1:34
          
          
          EXT. ACCESS PLATFORM/CHO MING SITE - DAY
          
          Above Yuri and the boys, people are leaping from the access
          platform onto the stern gate of the American ship.
          
          Yuri looks for a hole in the flow of people before seizing
          his chance and lifting the first of his boys up.
          
                                     YURI
                            (in Russian)
                    Pull yourself up!
          
          Oleg manages to reach up and hold onto the gate.

          Inside the ship, officers yell.
          
                                     DECK OFFICER (O.S.)
                    To the lower decks people!
          
          The gates suddenly screech back into life and begin to close.
          Yuri doubles his efforts lifting Alec higher, but Alec cannot
          quite reach.
          
          Yuri strains with all his effort before deciding.
          
                                     YURI
                    Oleg! Catch your brother!
          
          Yuri leaps forward holding Alec out in his arms.
          
          Oleg manages to grab his brother's hands as Yuri lets go and
          falls into the deep crevasse below. He makes no noise until
          he hits the rocks beneath.
          
          Oleg pulls his brother from above.
          
          
          INT. INSIDE LOADING GATE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          A SIREN blasts. Both of Yuri's sons are now on deck. A
          loading officer pulls them back, away from the gate.
          
                                     DECK OFFICER
                    Boys, you gotta move.
          
                                     ALEC
                    We wait for our father! He's still down
                    there!
          
          The loading officer attempts to comfort them.
          
                                     DECK OFFICER
                    There's no one down there.
                            (GENTLE)
                    Come on boys, come...
          
          The Officer and the boys look back as the stern gate slowly
          closes. But with a SCREECHING sound it grinds to a halt.
          
          The gate is jammed open leaving a twenty foot gap.
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          ALARMS sound. Anheuser and the Captain stare at the monitors.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    Why is the stern gate not closing?

                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS
                    Something's wrong with the hydraulics,
                    sir.
          
                                     ADRIAN (O.S.)
                    Captain, over here.
          
          They race over. Adrian points to a monitor.
          
                                     ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    I think we found the problem.
          
          On the monitor, they see Sarah and the others desperately
          waiting for Jackson and Lin.
          
                                     ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    How did they get in there?
          
                                     SURVEILLANCE OFFICER
                    They must have come through the
                    hydraulic chamber. There...
          
          Bobby, the Surveillance Officer, selects a different camera
          and we now see inside the tunnel in which Jackson is pulling
          along a wounded Lin.
          
                                     LAURA
                    That guy is injured. Something must
                    have gone wrong.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    You're damn right something went wrong!
                    Congratulations Helmsley, you may have
                    just killed us all but as long as your
                    conscience is clean...
          
          Adrian tries to ignore this.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Let's get an emergency crew there right
                    now. I'll meet them at the Hydraulic
                    Chamber.
          
          Anheuser sneers him, shooting a look to Laura.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    You think you're the main man now, just
                    because your fucking the President's
                    daughter?
          
          Without thinking, Adrian turns and punches Anheuser hard in
          the face. He drops to the floor, out cold.
          
          Everyone stands in stunned silence. Laura smiles. Adrian
          looks around.

                    What are you all waiting for?
          
          They speed off. The countdown reads 0 min. 53 sec.

          Further down in the valley, the tidal wave has reached the
          Cho Ming airfield, blasting away the planes with overwhelming
          force.

          The massive propellers of the ships begin to turn. However,
          the props of the American ship don't move.
          
          In the background, the huge tidal wave comes thundering
          towards them.
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          An IMPACT WARNING sounds as Adrian and Laura race through the
          crammed hallways with members of the rescue crew. One of the
          officers explains.
          
                                     TECHNICAL OFFICER
                    If we can't close the stern gate, then
                    the engines won't start.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    There's no way to override it?
          
                                     TECHNICAL OFFICER
                    No sir, it has to be done manually.

          Kate, Noah and Lilly watch as Jackson nears the end of the

          THE WAVE FINALLY HITS!
          
          All three vessels are now engulfed in churning water.
          
          They rock back and forth. Only the huge support towers
          they're resting on, keep them anchored.
          
          
          INT. INSIDE LOADING GATE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          A new ALARM sounds as water begins to shoot through the open
          stern gate of the American ship.
          
          The people on the loading bay panic, among them we see Alec
          and Oleg.
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          The same ALARM rings out in the hallways of the ship. Laura,
          Adrian and their party are all braced against the corridor,
          as the vessel undulates back and forth.
          
                                     SURVEILLANCE OFFICER
                    Water has penetrated the stern!
          
          Laura looks unsure.
          
                                     LAURA
                    What now?
          
                                     SURVEILLANCE OFFICER
                    The rear of the ship will start sealing
                    itself up one compartment at a time.
          
          Adrian looks at him.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Then how will we get to the hydraulic
                    chamber?
          
                                     SURVEILLANCE OFFICER
                    If we don't hurry, we won't be able to.
          
          Despite the violent movement of the ship, Adrian pushes on
          down the corridor towards the back of the boat. They follow.

          Water is also now rushing into the Zoological Bay and only
          the giraffe can manage to keep her head dry.
          
          Jackson is not yet out of the tunnel with an unconscious Lin.

          Kate shouts across to Tamara.

                    Tamara! Take Lilly and Noah.
          
          Kate reaches in to help Jackson as Tamara begins to move with
          Lilly. Noah remains back with his mother.
          
          Jackson finally makes it through with Lin. Kate is almost
          tearful with relief to see him.
          
                                     KATE (CONT'D)
                    I was so worried about you.
          
          Suddenly the Zoological bay begins to seal itself off.
          
          Lilly, already in the next compartment with Tamara and her
          dog, screams out as a chamber door quickly slides up, from
          the floor to the ceiling. It separates Lilly from her family.
          
                                       LILLY
                    Mummy!
          
          Jackson and Kate turn but it's too late. They only catch a
          glimpse of Lilly before they are sealed in. The water level
          continues to rise.
          
          
          INT. ANTE-CHAMBER ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Panicked, Tamara turns and looks around. Down the corridor,
          in the distance, she sees Adrian, Laura and the rescue crew
          approaching.
          
          But between them she spots the next chamber door rising
          quickly.
          
                                       TAMARA
                    Lilly run!
          
          Lilly starts moving as Tamara turns and picks up Caesar.
          
          Moving quickly, Lilly is able to climb up and over the fast
          rising door. But as she dangles from the other side, she
          looks down and is too scared to jump.
          
                                       TAMARA (O.S) (CONT'D)
                    Lilly! Take him.
          
          Lilly looks up and sees two hands straining to hold Caesar
          above the quickly narrowing gap.
          
          In a courageous move, Lilly grabs the little dog before he
          gets crushed and together they fall to the ground.

          Back on the other side of the chamber door, Tamara looks
          around. She is trapped now as the water continues to rush in.

                                     ADRIAN
                    Is there any way to talk to them?
          
          Lilly is close to tears.

          In the debris-filled, murky waters we see that the fuselage

          launch towers.
          
          Slowly it begins to bend, finally giving way. The other
          launch towers follow like dominos.
          
          The ship is ripped from its anchorage and sent drifting
          sideways, rudderless.

                                                                   117.
          
          EXT. DARJEELING VALLEY/HIMALAYA - DAY
          
          The giant ship drifts upside down and rudderless - smashed
          around by the debris and raging waters.
          
          But then, as it hits another ridge, it rolls right side up
          and seems to steady itself.
          
          However, the strong currents continue to force it through the
          mountain ranges of the Himalayas.

                    sir.
          
          The Captain's face drops.
          
                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS
                    You must be kidding!
          
          
          INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          The water rises fast as Kate sees the severity of Lin's wound
          for the first time.
          
                                     KATE
                    We need something to stop the bleeding
                    or he'll die.
          
          A split second later Noah holds out his belt.
          
                                     NOAH
                    Mum, will this do?
          
          Suddenly Jackson hears a voice over a speaker.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                            (Over a speaker)
                    Mr. Curtis... I'm Adrian Helmsley. We
                    met once before. Your daughter is with
                    me.
          
          Kate screams with relief.

          Adrian is using an emergency wall intercom, with Laura next
          to him, holding Lilly.
          
                                       LILLY

          Tamara hears Caesar over the speaker in her compartment and
          smiles with relief. She is struggling to stay afloat though,
          and is running out of air.
          
          
          INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Jackson discovers the wall speaker. He moves closer to it.
          
                                     ADRIAN (O.S.)
                    We can't get to you. Whatever you did,
                    jammed the hydraulics. If you can't get

          All eyes are on Adrian as he speaks.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    You're our only hope.
          
          Adrian looks at Laura.

                                     JACKSON
                    I'll go back. I'll try my best.
          
                                     NOAH
                    I'll go with you.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    You stay with Mommy.
          
          Jackson looks at Kate.
          
          
                                                              (CONTINUED)

                    I'll be right back...
          
          The water is up to their chest now. Jackson takes a breath
          and disappears underwater.

          Back on the bridge, Anheuser regains consciousness and gets
          to his feet. His nose is bleeding. He looks around him.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    Captain, what's happening?
          
          The Captain looks at him annoyed.

                    face of Mount Everest, Mr. Anheuser.
          
          Anheuser looks at him dumbfounded as he stumbles to the
          window and sees the massive rock face of Mount Everest in the
          distance.

          Jackson swims down into the dark chamber and reaches the
          jammed power tool, pulling at it. But it doesn't budge.

          The water level in Tamara's compartment is at its height now
          and she goes under.
          
          She struggles below the surface for a moment, looking around
          desperately for a way out but there is none.
          
          Tamara drowns.

          Jackson manages to find an air pocket. He fills up his lungs
          with air and thinks hard.
          
          As he strips off his jacket, he seems to have a plan. He
          dives under again.
          
                                                                   120.

          Lin is being held up in the water by his brother and parents.
          
          Kate has wrapped the belt around his lower leg and now pulls
          it tight. Lin screams.
          
          Noah uses this as the moment to dive underwater, unnoticed,
          to go and help his father.
          
          
          INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Back under water, Jackson is using the extension cord of the
          power drill to pull himself down to the tool cabinet.
          
          Jackson opens it, retrieving a giant crowbar. He begins to
          use it to dislodge the tool but it's hard work.

          Anheuser and everybody on the bridge stares as the north face

          Kate and the Pangs are desperately close to running out of
          air now, but despite this, Kate still tends to Lin.
          
          After a moment she turns and is first confused then horrified
          to see that Noah is nowhere to be found.
          
                                       KATE

          Jackson pulls with all his might, but he can't quite shift
          the drill.
          
          To his surprise, a pair of young hands join his on the handle
          of the crowbar. Noah is alongside him now, helping.
          
          Working as father and son, they manage, little by little, to
          loosen it before finally the drill comes free.
          
          Adrian gives Noah the thumbs up and the boy heads back to the
          surface. Jackson goes to follow but in the last moment he
          spots the knapsack containing his laptop.
          
          He dives back down for it.
          
                                                                      121.

                    Mom, we did it!
          
          Kate pulls him to her, relieved he is safe. Noah smiles and
          calls out towards the nearly submerged speaker.
          
          
          INT. CONNECTING CORRIDOR/ZOOLOGICAL BAY - DAY
          
          Lilly and Laura wait nervously. They hear a muffled voice.

                    We got it free. Can you hear me? We did
                    it!
          
          Adrian leaps up when he hears this. He flicks a button on the
          intercom.
          
                                     ADRIAN

          Jackson reaches his knapsack, but when sees Noah's cell phone
          lying next to it, he makes a decision and reaches for that
          instead.
          
          He hears the muffled sound of the engines and smiles. But as
          he turns to swim back, his face freezes--
          
          He's looking into the lifeless eyes of Gordon, who floats
          inches from his face.
          
                                                                     122.

          The battle seems hopeless. Captain Michaels yells at the top
          of his lungs.

          Everyone on the bridge watches in awe as Mount Everest,
          earth's highest peak, drifts slowly past.
          
          After a long beat, they begin to holler and cheer.

          Kate hears the CHEERING coming from the speakers. The water
          level stops rising but she still looks around in panic.
          
                                     KATE
                    Noah! Where is he?
          
          Noah begins to cry.
          
                                     NOAH
                    He was just behind me...
          
          Finally! Jackson bursts out of the water and takes a lungfull
          of wonderful air.
          
          Kate and Noah are overjoyed. The Pangs smile to one another.
          
          Jackson looks Kate squarely in the eyes.

                    are   still sharing our memories, hopes
                    and   ideas.
          
          Opposite him, Laura sits listening to him read.
          
                                     ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    ... And funny, just today we found out
                    that the entire crew of the Atlantis,
                    somehow or another, has relatives in
                    Wisconsin.
                            (PAUSE)
                    The end.
          
          Adrian closes the book. There's a moment of silence.
          
                                     LAURA
                    How many copies did you say that sold?
          
                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                     ADRIAN
                    Less than 500.
                            (with a smile)
                    It's what you might call a cult
                    classic.
          
          Laura looks at him grinning.
          
                                     LAURA
                    It seems we have very different tastes
                    Mr. Helmsley?
          
                                     ADRIAN
                            (PLAYFUL)
                    Well that's healthy Dr. Wilson.
                    Something we could maybe explore...
                    unless you have other pressing
                    engagements.
          
                                     LAURA
                    Actually my diary's pretty open.
          
          The intimate moment is cut short.
          
                                     OFFICER (O.S.)
                            (over loudspeaker)
                    Mr. Helmsley to the bridge please.

          Adrian and Laura make their way to the bridge.
          
                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS (O.S.)
                    Ladies and gentlemen, this is Captain
                    Michaels speaking. In a few minutes, I
                    will be giving the orders to unseal the
                    decks.
          
          
          INT. FRONT DECK/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Jackson and his family stand amongst thousands of other
          people who are gathering in anticipation.
          
                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS (O.S.)
                    Please be careful when you step out and
                    of course... enjoy the fresh air.
          
          Jackson kneels down and zips up Lilly's jacket. She is
          holding Caesar, whose still wearing his diamond collar.
          
                                     LILLY
                    Daddy? When can we go back home?

                                     JACKSON
                    There's nothing we can go back to
                    Lil'bee. Whatever's out there, that's
                    our home now. Don't be scared.
          
                                     LILLY
                    I'm not Daddy. No more pull-ups.
          
                                     JACKSON
                            (PROUDLY)
                    That's my big girl.
          
          Jackson squeezes Lilly's shoulder.
          
                                      OLEG (O.S.)
                    Can we pet him?
          
          Lilly turns to see Yuri's boys standing next to her.
          
                                     LILLY
                    Of course you can. He's your doggie.
          
          The boys both smile at her.
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Adrian and Laura enter the bridge.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    You called for me, sir?
          
                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS
                    Prof. West has something to show you,
                    Mr. Helmsley.
          
          The Captain directs him to a monitor.
          
                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS (CONT'D)
                    Looks like your scientific projections
                    are way off again.
          
          The Captain grins at Prof. West.
          
                                     PROF. WEST
                    The water is receding much faster than
                    we projected, Adrian...
          
          A monitor reveals an image of the African continent, however
          its shape changed dramatically. The image of the southern tip
          is enlarged.
          
                                      LAURA
                    What's that?

                                     PROF. WEST
                    It's hard to believe, but the Himalayas
                    are no longer the roof of the world.
                    It's now the Drakensberg mountains of
                    Kwa-Zulu Natal. The whole African
                    continent has risen several thousand
                    feet and most likely, never even
                    flooded.
          
                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS
                    Our European colleagues have already
                    set course for it.
          
          Captain Michaels hands Adrian a short wave radio.
          
                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS (CONT'D)
                    Here, somebody wants to talk to you.
          
          Adrian curious, grabs the mic.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    This is Helmsley.
          
          We hear a muffled, raspy voice through the speakers.
          
          
          INT. COMMAND BRIDGE/FREEDOM OF THE SEAS - DAY
          
          Harry Helmsley stands beside the cruise ship's Captain.
          
                                     VOICE
                    No, this is Helmsley.
          
                                     ADRIAN (O.S.)
                    Dad!... Is that you?
          
          
          INT. COMMAND BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Adrian is ecstatic. Captain Michaels explains.
          
                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS
                    We should have a visual of the `Freedom
                    of the Seas' shortly.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Dad. We're coming to pick you guys up.
                    How's Tony?
          
          
          INT. COMMAND BRIDGE/FREEDOM OF THE SEAS - DAY
          
          Harry looks over at Tony who's listening, smiling.
          
                                     HARRY HELMSLEY
                    He's fine, son. We're all fine.

                                     ADRIAN (O.S.)
                    See you guys soon. Bye dad.
          
          Harry hangs up. He picks up Tony, embracing him wildly.
          
          
          INT. COMMAND BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Adrian, still excited from speaking with his dad, grabs Laura
          and kisses her on the lips. She squeals.
          
                                     ANHEUSER (O.S.)
                    Put that woman down Helmsley.
          
          Adrian looks at Anheuser, unsure of what he might say.
          
                                     ANHEUSER (CONT'D)
                    Young guys like you with your
                    idealistic dreams, you think you can
                    change the world...
          
          Adrian and Laura exchange a look.
          
                                     ANHEUSER (CONT'D)
                    I just pray to God, that you keep on
                    making the right calls... in this new
                    world of ours.
          
          Adrian nods and with a smile to Laura turns to leave.
          
                                     ANHEUSER (CONT'D)
                    Mr. Helmsley, one more thing.
          
          Adrian turns back.
          
                                     ANHEUSER (CONT'D)
                    There was no one.
          
                                       ADRIAN
                    Pardon me?
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    There was no white kid better than you.
                    I'm terribly sorry I said that.
          
          Anheuser puts out his hand. Adrian takes it.

                    This is your Captain speaking. Standby
                    to open Deck 1.

          Neng pushes his brother Lin in a wheelchair onto the deck
          next to his parents. Mrs. Pang turns to her husband.
          
                                     MRS. PANG
                            (in Chinese)
                    I wonder will the clouds look the same
                    and the stars?
          
                                     MR.PANG
                    Do not fear. Some things will never
                    change.
          
          The old Chinese man forces a little smile. Closer to the
          front of this crowd Jackson approaches Noah.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    I thought you might want this.
          
          He takes Noah's cell phone from his pocket and hands it to
          him.
          
                                     NOAH
                    Do you think I'll still get a signal
                    ... Dad?
          
          Jackson is touched to hear him use that word. He smiles and
          hugs him. Adrian, Laura and Anheuser arrive alongside them.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    I finally finished your book Jackson.
          
                                     KATE
                    Really? You may well be the first
                    person who ever got to the end.
          
          Jackson looks at her, smiling playfully.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Excuse me, I believe he's addressing
                    the author. Well, what did you think?
          
          Adrian smiles.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    I'd say... those astronauts of yours
                    would be shitting themselves, if they
                    knew all their relatives are now stuck
                    in the South Pole.
          
          Suddenly a horn sounds and the sealed deck doors let off a
          burst of pressurised air. A murmur goes through the crowd.
          
          Everyone is silent as the huge deck doors slowly begin to
          roll back and light streams in.

          The Pang family try to see over people's heads, even Anheuser
          looks hopeful. Jackson pulls his family close as the first
          rays of daylight hit their faces.

          Hatches unseal all around the ship. Sun streams through the
          clouds. Everywhere people emerge outside, into the light of

          EXT. FRONT DECK/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          They all stare in awe at the waters receding against the ice-
          covered mountain peaks. Caesar lets out a YELP of joy.

          HELICOPTERS take off, flying towards a stunning site--
          
          The `Freedom of the Seas' is perched on a mountain peak,
          surrounded by calm waters. Behind it, they see the most
          beautiful rainbow. This is the new world.
