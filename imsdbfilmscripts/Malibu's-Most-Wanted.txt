     A small crowd and the press are gathered around BILL
     GLUCKMAN, his wife BESS (40s, lots of plastic surgery)
     and daughter BRENDA (11) who are on the porch of their
     12,000-square-foot mansion.

                 ... And so if you elect me
                 governor, I promise to take care
                 of California the same way I take
                 care of my own family; with
                 compassion, caring, kindness, and
                 most of all, with an interest in
                 everyone. My friends...
                         (catch phrase)
                 'California is my family!'
    The crowd cheers and waves "Gluckman For Governor" signs.
                               BILL
                 Speaking of family, I'd like to
                 introduce my wife Bess...
    Bess smiles and waves.
                               BILL
                 ... and my daughter, little
                 Brenda.
    Brenda smiles and waves like a campaign-trail veteran.
                               BILL
                 Any questions?
    The press begins shouting questions.       Bill picks...

                 Deb?
                               REPORTER #1
                 Where's your son?

    Bill is instantly flustered and TOM GIBBONS, Bill's
    campaign manager (African-American, but the soul of
    William F. Buckley) steps in front of Bill.
                               TOM
                 Thank you for all your questions,
                 but we've run out of...
    Just then the ground shakes with a frightening RUMBLE.
    Everyone quiets down -- is it an earthquake?   As the
    RUMBLE HITS again, the surface of the water in the koi
    pond ripples, a la Jurassic Park.
    Reporters look around anxiously as another RUMBLE HITS;
    Bill's face falls as he sees...

    The Escalade rolls into the driveway, hopping up and down
    on its amped-up hydraulics like something from Crenshaw
    Boulevard on a Friday night.
    The rear doors pop open and MOCHA (a.k.a. CHADWICK VAN
    PELT), dressed head to toe in hip-hop gear, steps out of
    the passenger side.
                                MOCHA
                 Yo yo yoooo!   Listen up, y'all!
    He lays down a beat "human beat box"-style as MONSTER
    (a.k.a. MIRIAM SHAIDELBAUM) climbs out. She's big,
    wearing short shorts, a tight leather halter, huge hoop
    earrings and oversized designer sunglasses.

    Next out is HADJI (a.k.a. YUSEF AMIRASLANI), a skinny
    Persian kid with cornrows.

    The driver's door swings open, and a gleaming white      pair
    of four hundred dollar, untied Nike sneaks as they      step
    to the pavement; we CRANE UP, PAST Nike sweats, to      BRAD
    GLUCKMAN, wearing a do rag under his Nike baseball      cap.

    Four fine white girls in bikini tops, vinyl shorts and
    Timberlands come out and dance behind Brad, shaking
    everything they've got. Reporters move in like vultures.
                               BRAD
                 'Y'all gathered here on this

    Tom again steps in and blocks Brad from view.

                 That's it for today, guys, very

    Two staff members hustle Brad into the house.

    Bill Gluckman's election team (GARY, JEN, and BRETT) work
    the phones as Tom paces; Bill stares out the window,
    lost.

                 No, no. I love his enthusiasm...
                 It's just a little misguided.
                 There must be something he can do
                 for the campaign, where he can't
                 hurt us.

                   Yes.  So from here on out I'm
                   going to be a better mother. I
                   want to get closer to you... be
                   there for you. If ever you
                   need --
      Just then, her CELL PHONE RINGS.         She pulls it out from
      her hip and answers.
                                 BESS
                   Hello? Celeste! When did you get
                   back?! What?! Oh my God! I've
                   been waiting for that bag for six
                   months!
                           (to Brad, covering
                            phone)
                   It's my personal shopper.
                           (back to phone)
                   Stay right there. I'm on my way!
      She stands.
                                 BESS
                   So... where we... Oh yes. I'm
                   always here for you, Bradley. Do
                   you have my cell number?
      She hands Brad a piece of paper and exits. Brad pulls
      down his shades and takes a long sip from his forty.

               only feel comfortable around folks
               who are the same as them. When

     A PAGER GOES OFF. Brad searches his pockets, pulls out a
     pager -- that's not it; pulls out another pager -- that's
     not it either; pulls out a two-way -- that's the one.

                  Great news. If he sees Brad five
                  days a week, he says we'll see
                  improvement in three to four

                  We've been brainstorming on some
                  different approaches, and I think
                  we may have something solid here.

                  Brad might act 'ghetto,' but let's
                  face it, he's never been east of

                  facts. Unless we do something
                  soon, Brad's gonna cost us this
                  election.

                  from, or what crew you're rolling
                  with, why can't you both be

                  there's no telling how high we can
                  go.

     Bill flies by, obviously from an O.S. trampoline, and
     soars over the gangbangers for a monster dunk.
     Freeze on:     the two awestruck "gangbangers."

     PJ pulls Brad's CD from the envelope.

     It is Brad, throwing the Malibu sign, surrounded by women
     in thongs with gigantic asses. The title, in graffiti

                  So we hold him for ransom?

                  Right.   But when you see   him
                  acting ghetto and all, it    pisses
                  you off  so much, you tour   him
                  around the 'hood to show    him what
                  things are really like.

     validation from guys.

     Brad swerves across three lanes of the freeway to take
     the exit, and suddenly finds himself actually in South
     Central. He's awestruck -- he notices a homeless guy
     with a shopping cart loaded with bags of stuff.

                  Yo. He really should use
                  delivery.
     Suddenly Sean pops his head into the car and stares
     directly at Brad. He puts a prop Tec 9 in Brad's chest
     and yanks him out of the car.

       Sean and PJ push Brad in. Bars are on the windows.     Sean
       pats Brad down, and pulls out his pager.
                                  SEAN

     Brad pulls out another pager, a phone, another phone.
     Sean and PJ both pull several more out of his other
     pockets, as well as his wallet.
                                PJ
                  All that James Bond electronic
                  crap can't save you now, fool.

     Brad does, and PJ duct-tapes his hands behind his back.

     Brad walks in, very nervous.       He looks back -- his car is
     parked so that PJ can see him      through the door. PJ
     smiles and shows him the gun      again. Brad swallows and
     approaches the counter. The       KOREAN GUY behind it watches
     him closely.

     Brad hurries to the back of the store, and spots a door
     by the beer cooler. He tries to open it. It's locked.
     Brad looks up to the security mirror and sees that the
     Korean Guy is watching him. He moves to the beer cooler
     and tries to calm down.

     English 40s and heads for the front. The         Korean Guy
     watches him as he walks past the counter        toward the door.
                                KOREAN GUY
                  Can I help you?
                                BRAD
                  Naaw, but I'ma help myself to all
                  this O.E., and whatever else I
                  want!
                               KOREAN GUY
                  No, stop.
     Brad drops the beer. It CRASHES to the floor in SLOW
     MOTION. Brad makes a crazy, threatening face as he pulls
     back a fist, but the Korean Guy throws a fast right hand,
     landing squarely on Brad's chin. Brad goes down like a
     sack of hammers; then we FLASHBACK TO:
     Moments earlier: We realize we've just been in a fantasy,
     as Brad again approaches the counter with his beer.
                                KOREAN GUY
                  Can I help you?

                          (nervous)
                  Let me axe you something.   Ever
                  been robbed?
                                KOREAN GUY
                  Oh sure. Last week was my fifty-
                  fourth time. But they were cool,
                  no gun to head, never scream; you
                  know, good people.
                               BRAD
                  Cool.
     He sets the 40s on the counter, then reaches into his
     waistband for his gun, and we...

                I thought you set it up.

                              SEAN

      Brad finishes reaching into his waistband for the Glock,
      but feels something else. He pulls out a small wallet
      that was Velcroed to his belt.
                              BRAD
                My emergency stash.    Thank you
                God.
      He pulls out a hundred and kisses it.

      He whips a .44 from under the counter and aims it at
      Brad.

                ... and wid dis.
      The Korean Guy's wife has an AK-47 on Brad, the red dot
      of its laser sight trained steadily in the middle of his
      forehead.
                                 KOREAN GUY
                   ... And wid dat.
      The Korean Guy's six-year-old boy has a sawed-off shotgun
      pointed at Brad's knees. The gun is bigger than the boy.
      The Koreans laugh at Brad. Brad drops the hundred on the
      counter.
                                 BRAD
                   Keep the change.

                   Thank you very much. Come again.
      As Brad looks out to make sure PJ and Sean haven't seen
      anything, the Korean Guy sticks the receipt in between
      two of the 40s. Unaware, Brad gathers his stuff and
      heads to the door.
                                 BRAD
                   Uh, I know this is gonna sound
                   wack, but what I'm about to do is
                   just a joke, so don't shoot me,

                   If you jacked this, how come you

                  Cube, Snoop, they all came up
                  through here.

                  You want to prove yourself, this
                  the place to do it.
     They shove Brad into the club, then turn to each other
     and giggle like school girls.

                                SEAN
                  This is definitely gonna do it.
                               PJ
                  Pay day!
     They pound and follow Brad into the club.

       Brad enters and takes in the club. Think 8 Mile.
       Hardcore GANGSTER TYPES and some tough HOME GIRLS check
       out rapper, DROP, whose ferocious, gravel-voiced raps
       show you exactly what kind of place you're in.
                                  SEAN
                    How you feelin' now, Malibu?

                                  BRAD
                    Finally, a place where I feel at
                    home.

                    Get yo' ass in there.
       Brad boldly fist-shakes jaw-dropped patrons as he wades
       through the crowd, AD LIBBING "Whassup?" and "Pardon me,
       homey."

       ON STAGE
       DROP finishes and the MC brings up STEEL and YOUNG DRE,
       announcing the Battle Rap Competition. Steel and Young
       Dre battle -- both are top-notch. At every insult, the
       crowd ROARS.

       Shondra is    talking to a HOME GIRL, checking out the crowd
       below. She     suddenly sees Brad. She's eyes-wide
       horrified.     Steel finishes, the crowd CHEERS, and Young
       Dre starts    in on the mic.

       SAME SCENE - MEANWHILE
       Sean and PJ leave Brad and fight through to the DJ table,
       where the MC is standing, timing Young Dre.
       Brad looks around, then up.     He sees Shondra and starts
       for the stairs.

                                   TEC (O.S.)
                   Hey, girl.    Where you been?
      She turns and faces TEC, her ex-boyfriend, a no-nonsense
      roughneck gangbanger. He's very soft-spoken, almost
      expressionless.
                                 SHONDRA
                   None of your damn bizness, Tec.
                   Now let go.
      She yanks her arm away from him.

                                 TEC
                   Y'all been busy, huh?
                                 SHONDRA

                   Come on, girl, I'm cool.    Just
                   tell me who it is.
                                 SHONDRA
                   All you need to know is that it
                   ain't you, okay?

                                 TEC
                   You know, you ain't shit, Shondra.
                   You're just a chickenhead, and
                   that's all you'll ever be.
      Just then, Brad walks up, grinning like a fool.
                                 BRAD
                   What up, girl?!
      He gives her a sloppy kiss on the cheek.

                   that?
      She tries to pull away, but Tec holds on tight.

                                BRAD
                   Damn, man. Don't you know how to
                   treat a lady? That's not nice.
                                 SHONDRA

                   It's cool, Shondra.      The brutha's
                   right.
      Tec releases Shondra's arm and immediately grabs Brad by
      the throat and hangs him over the balcony.
                                 TEC
                   Didn't yo mama teach you to mind

      Tec feels everyone looking at him. Now is not the time.
      He releases Brad and composes himself.
                                 TEC
                   Y'all both gonna be sorry.
      Tec stalks off.

                   Yo!
      Sean bumps the DJ table. A vicious look from the DJ, as
      Sean tries to play it off. The MC just looks at him
      disdainfully.
                                 PJ
                   Uh... My boy want Young Dre next.

                              MC
                A-ight y'all. Up next, to
                challenge Young Dre, we got... B-
                rad from Malibu.
      Looks of confusion, as the Crowd searches for "B-rad."
                              SHONDRA
                Wait a second. Brad, don't do it.
      Brad turns to Shondra, looks at the keys, and shakes his
      head.

                              BRAD
                Shondra, I gots to do 'dis. this
                is my shot. I gotta prove myself.
      Shondra can't argue. Brad starts to the stage. A WAVE
      OF SHOCK, as the crowd realizes who B-rad actually is.
                              SHONDRA
                This is gonna be like an episode
                of 'Oz.'
      Brad gets his game face on and walks the gauntlet on his
      way to the stage -- an imposing path of intimidating
      looks.

      He is then dragged up onto the stage. He misinterprets
      the ANTAGONIZING CHANTS as encouragement and tries to
      high-five the crowd -- no takers. The MC and Young Dre
      laugh at him.
                                 YOUNG DRE
                   Nah, nah, nah... I ain't gonna

                   Turner?

      Brad LAUGHS, turning to the crowd to appreciate his lame
      burn... Nothing. Young Dre looks furious.
      Young Dre grabs the mic and the DJ spins. Young Dre
      proceeds to incinerate Brad. With every line, the crowd
      goes insane. (NOTE: Actual Young Dre Rap to Come.)
      As Young Dre flows, Brad is visibly shaken, but tries to
      play it off -- not so discreetly scribbling notes on his
      hand and up his arm.
      Young Dre finishes with devastating blow, dropping the
      mic on the stage. The crowd goes wild...

      The DJ kicks the beat and the MC throws Brad the mic. He
      misses it and it drills him in the forehead. The crowd
      LAUGHS. Brad tries to regain his composure...

      TAUNTS and LAUGHS as the beat plays again. Brad wags his
      head, ready to come in strong. He looks down at his
      notes... He's sweating so badly his arm is a mess of
      runny ink.
      He freezes again... The crowd is really on him now --
      collectively making the "choke" sign.

                   I'm sorry...
      The crowd erupts with outrage and rushes the stage.

      WAILS with terror as he's passed hand-over-hand above the
      CURSING CLUB PATRONS, (crowd surfing-style) toward the
      exit.
      Four THUGS run Brad out of the back door, into the...

      ... where they launch him into the dumpster with a
      resounding THUD.

      Brad's landing causes the lid to SLAM violently shut, and
      forces Sean and PJ, who've been hiding behind it, to pop
      up.
                              SEAN
                What was that?
      A RUMBLE comes from the dumpster and they pull back the
      lid.
      ANGLE ON: Inside the dumpster where Brad lies in the
      bottom -- his fall was broken by several loaves of old
      Wonder Bread.
      PJ and Sean fall into hysterics, as Shondra emerges from
      the club. She finds PJ and Sean apoplectic with
      laughter, shakes her head and begins to help Brad out of
      the dumpster.

      Tec watches it all going down.
      SNUFFY, 20, skinny but tough-looking chollo, and not a
      member of Tec's crew, is standing next to Tec.

     Tec starts to laugh, then suddenly his fist explodes into
     Snuffy's face. Snuffy drops, and Tec starts to stomp him
     until his boys, 8-BALL and DEUCE, pull him off.

     between them, devastated. Shondra's behind, looking
     bummed out as they head for the car.

     They burst out laughing. Brad just stares ahead,
     pouting, sick to his stomach.

                                SHONDRA
                  Thank you.
     Brad leans in and kisses her tenderly. She kisses him
     back. Encouraged, Brad opens his mouth wide and tries to
     stick his tongue down her throat. She pushes him back.
                                SHONDRA
                  I said kiss, fool. Damn.

     She gets up and heads for the door.
                                SHONDRA
                  I offered you a snack, not the
                  whole kitchen.
                                 BRAD
                  I'm sorry.   I'm sorry.   I'm chill.
     She rolls her eyes and leaves. Brad falls back on the
     bed, a dreamy smile on his face.
                                BRAD
                  Totally chill.

     Shondra exits the room and faces Sean and PJ.
                             SHONDRA
               A'ight, that's it, this game is
               lame. I want my money, and then
               y'all can get out.
                             PJ
               But we're not done yet...
                             SHONDRA
               You ain't never gonna be done.
               Did it ever occur to you two
               jackasses that this is the way he
               really is?
                               SEAN
               No way.
                               PJ
               Not possible.
                             SHONDRA
               Whatever. Look, I did what you
               asked, and I want my money.
                             SEAN
               Okay, I'll get it, you know, but
               settin' everything up was
               expensive, and I don't exactly
               have it right now.
                              SHONDRA
               Excuse me?   You playin' me?
     Shondra hands Sean the phone.
                             SHONDRA
               Y'all get me my money now, or I'ma
               go in there and tell him what's
               up.
                             SEAN
               Alright, okay, just relax...

      Sean reads from the checklist Tom gave him.
                                 SEAN
                   Your suggestions were really
                   helpful. He totally bought the
                   car jack and kidnapping...

      Brad listens intently as Sean continues.
                                 SEAN (O.S.)
                   ... we staged a fabulous liquor
                   store robbery. Mr. Gluckman's
                   going to be very happy...
      Brad's eyes widen.
                                 SEAN (O.S.)
                   But, he's still posing, so we
                   wanted to put him in a drive-by
                   shooting next... but, it's a
                   little more money then our
                   original projections...
      Brad slumps back.     He can't believe it.

                                 SEAN
                   So I was wondering if I could get
                   an advance.
                                 TOM (V.O.)
                   No deal. You get the rest when
                   Richie Cunningham steps through

      Brad crawls out from the vent and goes to the mirror.

                Damn... they been playin' me all
                along. How could dey do dat? How

                        (getting angry)
                What-ever. If them fools wanna
                play, then let's play.
      He heads for the door, bad-ass and hardcore.

      Suddenly, Brad's boot comes through the door. WOOD
      SHATTERS everywhere. Brad steps through with a furious
      look on his face. Shondra, Sean and PJ stare in shock.
                              SHONDRA
                What the hell do you think you're
                doing?

                Do something.

                You must be out yo mind. Get back

      Sean backs down.

                Anyone else wanna step?

     Shondra, PJ and Sean watch, stunned, as Brad grabs a prop
     gun, his car keys and heads out.

                  Come on, girl. Let's go!

                  Uhn uhn. You created that

     Suddenly, Tec jumps up, yanks Brad's door open and shoves
     a Nine in his side.

     A crew member yanks out some duct tape and tapes over
     Brad's mouth, then they throw him in Tec's trunk and slam
     it shut. Tec steps up to Sean and PJ.

                  What should we do with this

                   It's brought.
                                BRAD
                   Man up! Put this wannabe out of

      Tec is stunned -- the white boy isn't showing any fear.
      Brad steps forward, puts the gun to his own heart, and
      places his thumb on the trigger.
                                 BRAD
                   That gat's real, right?    Then do

                   Brotha straight-up crazy, and I
                   cannot deal with that shit.
      Suddenly GUNFIRE erupts as Tech's car is HIT with a
      BARRAGE of BULLETS. Brad, the crew, Sean and PJ drop to
      the street and roll under the car. Tec has to dive
      behind a nearby dumpster.

      ACROSS STREET
      Snuffy and three Rollin' G's are crouched behind their
      low rider, FIRING away.

      UNDER CAR
      The I-9s RETURN FIRE. PJ and Sean are in the fetal
      position, freaking out. Brad, thinking it's all fake, is
      laughing, having a great time.
                                 TEC
                   Lay down some cover, fool!
      Tec's pinned down behind the dumpster. He's without
      a weapon, and Rollin' G's are FOCUSING their FIRE on
      him.
                                 8-BALL

      Brad grabs the Uzis and rolls out from under the
      car.

      He jumps up on the hood of Tec's car and OPENS FIRE with
      both Uzis, laying down a withering rain of lead.
                                 BRAD

                   Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!
      The Rollin' G's try to respond, but Brad's fire is too
      intense.

      They all hop in their convertible and tear-ass out of
      there as Brad jumps off the cars and follows on foot,
      FIRING after them as they turn the corner and SQUEAL
      away.

                                 BRAD
                   It's safe now, y'all.
      Tec emerges from behind the dumpster. The crew rolls out
      from under the car, followed by Sean and PJ. They look
      at Brad in awe. They're impressed.
                                   TEC
                   That was ill!    Y'all definitely
                   got juice.
      He offers his fist to Brad.        They pound.
                                 TEC
                   Where'd you learn that shit?

     Tec hauls Brad in, followed by Shondra. The I-9s draw
     weapons; the room fills with tension. Sean and PJ look
     on, getting caught up in the action.
                                BRAD

                  Please, don't be hatin'.
     Shondra steps in front of Brad.
                                SHONDRA
                  I won't let you do it, Tec.
                                TEC
                  No problem, then.   I'll just do
                  the both of you.
     Tec levels the barrel at Shondra and Brad. He starts to
     squeeze the trigger when suddenly Bill's HUMMER CRASHES
     through the wall. I-9's scatter and duck as the Hummer's
     front grill skids to a stop inches from Tec. The
     driver's door pops open and Bill jumps out.

                                 TEC
                  Damn fool!   You just hit my house!

     Bill turns:     six I-9s are aiming guns at he and Brad.

                  violence is tearing Californians
                  apart... You see, guys, California
                  is my family, and hey, here's a
                  thought. Instead of thinking of
                  ourselves as what set we're from,
                  or what crew we're rolling with,
                  why can't we just be brothers?

                  say, 'brothers'?
     The I-9's smile, cock their weapons, aim them, and just
     as they're about to start blasting, the side WALL
     EXPLODES and Hadji's dad's MERCEDES CRASHES through.

     Gangsters fall back as Hadji, Mocha, and Monster jump out

                  and you never cared to find out.
                  And now that your election's on
                  the line, that's when you take a
                  stand? That's bullshit, Pops.

                  A'ight, cool, but all these gats
                  got to go!
     As Brad grabs the missile launcher from Hadji...
                                MOCHA
                          (moved, earnest)
                  Word up, B. All this hatin' is
                  wack!
     Mocha slams the butt of the musket down, and the
     flintlock slams forward. Everyone cringes. Nothing
     happens. Everyone looks at the MUSKET, then suddenly it
     EXPLODES and a rusty musket ball FIRES OUT, slamming
     Monster in the middle of her Kevlar breastplate. She
     flies back and slams into the wall, causing her spear gun
     to fire -- a SPEAR SHOOTS OUT and lands directly into
     Brad's left ass cheek. Brad howls and drops the MISSILE
     LAUNCHER...
     SLOW MOTION:     everyone watches it fall to the ground...
     REAL TIME:     it hits the floor and the MISSILE FIRES.

     the missile flies past gang members, through the kitchen
     door, and slams into the side of the gas oven. We hear a
