          1.
                         
          EXT. DEVON, ENGLAND. A SUMMER'S DAY, 1912.
                         
          The bucolic magnificence of the Devon countryside. We fly
          low over the high, thick hedges untouched for hundreds of
          years. The thick verdant countryside in all its splendor,
          ancient woodlands, fields of corn, and finally a paddock in a
          typical Devonshire dale.
                         
          We come to rest beside three farmers standing over a pregnant
          mare. The mare is in distress - she is about to give birth.
          The farmers calm the mare and tend to her gently with
          assurance and authority.
                         
          We pull back to see, ALBERT, a fifteen-year-old farm boy,
          watching the whole drama with delight from the paddock gate.
                         
                          FARMER
           Come on, easy, girl. Easy, girl.
           Easy.
                         
          The men hold the mare firmly, but clearly this is a difficult
          birth.
                         
                          FARMER 2
           This is a stubborn one, huh?
                         
                          FARMER 3
           There we go. Who's a clever girl?
                         
          Moments later - the summer's sun glints off the wet, sticky
          hide of the foal (JOEY) - red hide, four white socks and a
          distinctive white cross on its forehead.
                         
          Soon the creature is attempting its first clumsy steps. It is
          both awesome and comical to see the new born creature
          struggle to his feet, but eventually, he succeeds.
          Title: WAR HORSE
                         
          EXT. PADDOCK/FIELD, DEVON. VARIOUS.
                         
          We follow Joey's progress over the course of his first year.
          His initial fearfulness, his connection with his mother, the
          intimacy of their relationship.
                         
          As Joey gets strong they run together, frolicking gayly in
          the last dregs of summer. Albert looking on. Joey notices him
          at the fence and they share a moment of connection.
                         
          Spring: flowers are beginning to sprout by the hedgerows. Our
          boy Albert runs into the field. He takes an apple from his
          pocket - he holds it out tentatively. Joey approaches Albert
          with suspicion. Albert gently encourages him.
           2.
                         
          His mother paws the ground and neighs at Joey. He turns and
          runs over the field at her beck and call.
                         
          Albert tosses the apple to himself, ruefully - watches in awe
          as Joey races away with his mother.
                         
          He is a magnificent one year old. His distinctive red coat
          gleaming, now it is clear that he is half thoroughbred. He
          runs quickly around the field enjoying his own power and
          strength.
                         
          Later - the three farmers open the gate and come into the
          field. Both Joey and his mother instinctively canter over to
          the two men, expecting food. The three men gently greet the
          horses and pet them, then we see one man has a noose made of
          a rope. He slips it round Mum's neck. She pulls back, Joey is
          shaken and bewildered but before he knows what's happening
          the second farmer is trying to get a similar rope around his
          neck. Joey balks and pushes the farmer aside, distressed to
          see his mother tethered. The farmer grabs Joey again and
          struggles with him, enlisting the help of the second farmer.
          With some effort they get the rope around his neck and calm
          him down.
                         
                          FARMER 2
           Easy does it. Easy does it. Come on,
           steady does it.
                         
          Unused to being tethered Joey pulls at the rope but the
          farmers are solid and firm. They gently lead Joey and his
          mother across the field to the gate and out into the road.
                         
          The whole road becomes overtaken by a flock of sheep on their
          way to the market. In the distance we hear the bustle of
          Market Day.
                         
          EXT. THE MARKET. THE SAME.
          The farmers lead Joey and his mother through the chaos of the
          market and into an auction pen. They find themselves amongst
          a hoard of pigs, sheep and cows. Joey is agog at all of these
          creatures and all this life he had no idea existed.
                         
          The farmers lead the horses into a stall to await the
          auction. Joey is bewildered by all the noise - buttressed
          against a couple of mules and a cow. He is uncomfortable in
          this tight space.
                         
          An AUCTION WORKER holds a clipboard out for the lead farmer.
                         
                          AUCTION MAN 1
           Mornin', pop. Put your mark here.
           Good luck.
           3.
                         
          EXT. JOEY'S PEN. THE SAME.
                         
          Two men approach the pen.
                         
                          AUCTION MAN 2
           Get the colt...
                         
          One man grabs Joey and pulls him out of the pen. Suddenly
          there is a look of horror on his face. His terrified mother
          realises they are being separated. Joey panics and
          desperately tries to get back to his mother, he rises up
          throwing the man who is leading him aside. Joey is out of
          control. The man regains control of Joey.
                         
                          AUCTION MAN 3
           Whoa! Whoa!
                         
          He pulls Joey away from his mother, who lets out a heart-
          rending cry, paws the ground, and crashes her foreleg against
          the fence. Joey remains disoriented in the midst of the
          market day chaos.
                         
           AUCTION MAN 3 (CONT'D)
           Easy...
                         
          INT. MAIN AUCTION RING. THE SAME.
                         
          The auction ring is full of people of all shapes and sizes.
          There is a sense of celebration and busyness about market
          day.
                         
          We concentrate on two men - Ted Narracott (DAD), in his
          forties, clearly both the cares of the world and alcohol have
          worn him down before his time, and SI EASTON, his more solid
          friend, both working farmers. Just behind Si is his 15 year
          old son, ANDREW. Ted has a drink in his hand. They all look
          at Joey bridling against the men who are trying to hold him.
                          DAD
           Now that's a beauty.
                         
                          SI EASTON
           Forget it, Ted. He's half
           thoroughbred and not got a day's
           work in him.
           (points to a plow horse next to
                          JOEY)
           Now, there... There's your ticket.
                         
          In contrast to Joey, the solid and bulky plow horse stands
          like a rock. But Dad remains fixated on Joey.
                         
                          DAD
           But look at him, Si. Look at that creature.
           4.
                         
          Indeed, Joey is magnificent, his power clearly emerging
          because of his upset.
                         
                          SI EASTON
           Don't be daft. You need something
           solid to plow a field.
                         
                          DAD
           (fixed on Joey)
           Yeah, but he's something else, that one.

          FRED shouts his reply from the crowd.

           much as a pork scratching.
                         
          The crowd are loving all this.
          Dad notices a figure across the ring, LYONS, clearly a man of
          money. You can see something light up in Dad's eyes - a
          combination of dislike and alcohol.
                         
          Joey is led into the auction pen.

          Joey is still trying to get back to his mother. A voice from
          the crowd pipes up:
                         
                          LYONS

          Lyons whispers to his son, DAVID, 15, next to him. David eyes

          Total silence. He stares hard at Lyons. Who simply smiles,
          raises an eyebrow, tips his hat and walks away. It dawns on
          Dad that he's won the auction. He breaks into a sweat.

          Dad doesn't acknowledge Si.
                         
          Moments later - Ted stands staring at Joey, who looks back.
          Ted holds his reins numbly, accepts his receipt from the
          auction man in a kind of daze.
                         
          Suddenly, Lyons appears at Dad's shoulder.

           Quite a beast, there. But what you gonna do
           with him - on a working farm? I hope you
           got the rent, Ted. I'll be around for it
           when it comes due.
                         
          Dad does not acknowledge Lyons. Lyons smiles and walks away
          with son David, and his cronies. Si shakes his head at Dad.

          MRS. NARRACOTT kneels in her garden, digging up some carrots,
          when she sees Ted returning.
                         
          Dad walks down the hedged lane as the sun sets pulling Joey
          with him, his bad leg always moving slightly to the side.
           8.
                         
          Mrs. Narracott looks in horror and bewilderment at Joey and
          then at Dad. She is a good-looking, intelligent woman, but
          clearly her life is always hard.

          Dad stands shamefaced as Albert - the boy we have already met
          - runs out of the house to join them.

           MRS. NARRACOTT (CONT'D)
           He's not worth ten! Are you out of your

           How the hell are we gonna pull anything with
           that? Ted - you have to take him back. You
           have to take him back right now now.

           for our money back.
                         
          Joey bridles at the raised voices but Albert takes the rope
          and tries to calm him.
                         
                          ALBERT
           No. No, please don't take him back.
                         
          Suddenly we see Dad's dejection. He is a man lost.
                         
                          DAD
           We can't take him back till he's broken in.

           And how are you gonna train a horse with
           that leg?
                          ALBERT
           I'll train him.
                         
           MRS. NARRACOTT
           No, you stay out of this, Albie. You don't
           know nothing about horses.

           We have to keep him. We've no choice.
                         
           MRS. NARRACOTT
           Right. Well... you've got one month to
           break him in or I'm taking him back myself.

          Mrs. Narracott turns back towards the house, then stops,
          dazed, speaking almost to herself.
                         
           MRS. NARRACOTT
           We're gonna lose everything. After all we've

          She turns back to the others - the weight of the mistake
          heavy on their shoulders - but Albert quickly steps forward.

           Well, you better. Go on - get started. See
           if a child can undo what your fool of a
           father's done to this family of ours.
                         
          Mrs. Narracott storms into the house. Albert immediately
          goes to stroke Joey but the nervous horse draws back
          uncomfortably. Dad leads him off, drunk and bewildered,
          across the yard to the barn.
                         
          EXT. STABLES. LATER.
                         
          Albert loads some oats into a bucket and approaches Joey in
          the field.
                          ALBERT
           Right. Let's make a start then.
                         
          As Albert approaches, Joey nervously runs in circles, then
          stops on a dime, looking at Albert suspiciously.
                         
                          ALBERT (CONT'D)
           It's oats. Very tasty, that is. It's
           beef and gravy to us!
                         
          Albert squats down. He shows the food. Joey catches the
          scent on the air, but still hesitates and shies away.
                         
                          ALBERT (CONT'D)
           Come on...
                         
          This time, Albert takes a new tact, almost turning his body
          fully away from Joey, but keeping the bucket extended.
          Albert slowly backs towards Joey, speaking gently all the
          while.
                         
                          ALBERT (CONT'D)
           I bet you're missing your mother.

           your mum. First time away from home.
           But you're not alone, are you. In
           fact. Cos I'm `ere...
                         
          Feeling safer, Joey moves toward the bucket of oats and
          starts to eat.
                         
                          ALBERT (CONT'D)

           11.
                         
          Albert reaches out his hand and touches Joey. And with a
          slight start, the horse relaxes into Albert's hand, feeling
          safe with the boy.
                         
          Albert stares at the distinctive white cross on Joey's
          forehead. Joey calms.
                         
                          ALBERT (CONT'D)

          Albert strokes Joey's forehead. Joey lifts his head and the
          two stare at each other in close proximity.

          The training episode: Albert walks Joey around the yard on
          the rope. It all seems to be going well. Mum looks on. Albert
          is clearly proud of his progress.
                         
          EXT. PADDOCK. ANOTHER DAY.
                         
          Albert's friend, Andrew Easton, sits on a rock with an apple
          in hand to watch the training.
                         
          Albert sets Joey in a spot and tells him to wait.

          Of course when Albert walks away, Joey follows.
                         
          A game of "Grandma's footsteps" ensues as Albert patiently

          Joey. Joey panics and bolts. The plow spins to its side,
          pulls Albert off his feet. Joey drags them all the way to

          Mrs. Narracott moves away from the window, takes a seat, and

          Joey strains as Albert pushes with all his might. We sense
          the strain on the horse and the inappropriateness of the
          task. But Joey perseveres. The plow limps along.

          goes to his knees. Albert rushes to his side.

          Rosie stalks over to a pile of broken equipment in a corner
          of the stables. She rummages until she finds a waterstained
          brown paper parcel tied with yarn. She brushes away some

          her as she gently opens the paper.

           won't tell me either. But the first
           day he got home he just... tossed

          Ted tends to.
                         
          The sun is breaking through and Joey starts to run across the
          field and up a small incline. As both Joey and Albert gain
          confidence they pick up speed. Albert pushes Joey on, they
          are going faster and faster, Albert yells with the
          exhilaration of it all. Joey races flat out across the
          countryside. Albert hanging on for dear life.

          beside the car, racing it. David Lyons looks to see Albert
          and Joey running alongside his car. He feigns disinterest.
          Albert glances at David, but he's much more interested in the
          very pretty young woman seated next to David, her hands
          trying to control her hair, flying in the wind. Forgetting
          himself momentarily, Albert stares at her, dazzled. The woman
          turns to David:

          But not for long. The sound of the acceleration and Albert's
          eagerness to impress the young woman make Joey go faster, and
          again he moves out ahead of the car. The young woman grins
          at Albert.
                         
          Up ahead Albert sees that the wall alongside of which he's
          been racing turns the corner, presenting him and Joey with an
          obstacle. Albert encourages Joey to go faster.

          Joey balks and comes to a dead standstill, sending Albert
          sailing over the wall.
                         
          Back in the car, the girl gasps and covers her mouth,

          smile.

          The market square is full of military men. The Union Jack is
          flying up the flagpole. A group of girls has gathered to
          check out the army boys. Eager young men crowd a table

          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS is in the square inspecting Joey,
          knowledgably. He is a handsome, attractive, modest, upper
          class man. Dad stands beside him. He checks Joey's teeth, his
          feet and finally, looks him straight in the eye.

          Captain Nicholls has immediately connected with Joey and puts
          him at his ease. SAM PERKINS, a tough sergeant, is physically

          Albert races towards Joey. Ted grabs him. Albert fights to
          get free. He looks at his father in anger and betrayal.

          song they all know, which means a lot to them - full of soul -
          a song of harvest or a Celtic hymn, something relating
          specifically to the lives they have led together. Everyone of

           Waterloo to Omdurman, from Pickett's Charge
           to the Battle of Mars La Tours - the first
           attack can and should be the decisive one.

                          SAM PERKINS
           Yes, sir!
                         
                          MAJOR STEWART
           No excuses, no mistakes - every
           horse groomed and fit for
           presentation! I want a full practice
           charge tomorrow.
                         
                          SAM PERKINS
           Sir.
                         
          They leave.
                         
          EXT. SALISBURY PLAIN. DAY.
                         
          The whole regiment is gathered. Everybody is in their
          ceremonial uniform. It all has the feeling of the Changing of
          the Guard rather than anything related to a real battle. The
          day is hot, the plains are quiet and beautiful, the gathering
          is huge, there is a real sense of pride and anticipation.
                         
          Captain Nicholls, resplendent in full uniform rides Joey out
          over the vast expanse of the plain. Both Nicholls and Joey
          are dressed up like something from the last century, out of
          the Boer War, even the Charge of the Light Brigade. Nicholls
          is proud and confident. They gather before hundreds of men
          and horses all lined up to be inspected. Charlie joins them,
          looking pretty good on Blenheim.
          Finally, Nicholls and Charlie reach Stewart and Topthorn
          waiting in position.
                         
                          MAJOR STEWART
           Thought you two had bottled out.
                         
                          CHARLIE WAVERLY
           As if.
                         
          Nicholls looks at his friend tolerantly.
                         
                          MAJOR STEWART
           All right, then, let's see what you
           two jokers are made of, shall we?
           40.
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           This is what quiet confidence looks like.
                         
                          CHARLIE WAVERLY
           I'll wait for you two at the Duke of York.
                         
          Nicholls and Stewart and Charlie prepare themselves for the
          charge. Joey and Topthorn size up to one another.
                         
                          MAJOR STEWART
           Over to you, Captain Nicholls.
                         
          Topthorn bristles at Joey. Everyone is highly charged. The
          competition between Stewart and Nicholls seems to have been
          absorbed between the horses. Topthorn and Joey square up for
          the practice charge like two athletes before a race.
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           Draw...swords!
                         
          Nicholls raises his sword. It glints in the summer air. It
          seems to hang there forever. Every man follows suit.
                         
          Topthorn and Joey glance at each other, ready to charge.
                         
           CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D)
           Give...point!
                         
          Every sword is pointed directly ahead at arm's length.
                         
           CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D)
           Charge!!!!
                         
          A roar goes up from the men and a deafening pounding of
          hooves breaks the silence. The huge line of horses start
          running straight ahead of them. Joey and Topthorn run off at
          top speed. Dust and earth rise up behind them.
          Bugles, the deafening thunder of hooves. It is exhilarating.
          We see the scale of the operation, we enjoy the speed and the
          splendor of the mass of men and horses. The soldiers shout in
          glee and excitement. Each man pushes his horse to out-run
          those around him, Nicholls and Stewart seem locked in mortal
          combat.
                         
          Nicholls smiles at Stewart, confidently.
                         
          Topthorn starts to pull away, ahead of all the other horses
          in the line. Nicholls pushes Joey on. Topthorn seems too
          strong, Joey will never catch them. Nicholls is determined
          not to be beaten.
           41.
                         
           CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D)
           Come on, Joey. I know you've got
           it. Come on, boy! Come on!
                         
          He pushes Joey on. Joey digs in and finds hidden strength and
          speed. He starts to catch up with Topthorn and draws along
          side. Nicholls and Stewart exchange tense looks.
                         
           CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D)
           Come on, boy!
                         
          Stewart is amazed and pushes Topthorn harder.
                         
          Now both riders are going at their top speed. They are neck
          and neck - they fight for every inch of advantage, every
          fibre of their being invested in the race. Nicholls pushes
          Joey on and Joey pulls away. Joey inches forward till he is
          almost a length ahead of Topthorn. The effort is enormous.
          Nicholls looks back at Stewart, very happy. Stewart's
          frustration shows. He knows he is beaten.
                         
          Then suddenly they race over the line. Nicholls spears a ring
          decorated with a blue ribbon and pulls Joey to a halt. They
          have crossed the enemy line. Nicholls is ecstatic. Topthorn
          comes to Joey's side.
                         
                          MAJOR STEWART
           Whoa. Whoa.
                         
          Nicholls laughs, grinning.
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           Nice of you to turn up.
                         
          The horses are nose to nose, snorting, we sense the heat, the
          exertion. Topthorn and Joey are brought together by the
          effort. We sense Topthorn's newly minted respect for Joey.
          And Joey is no soft touch - he slightly holds his head up in
          victory, letting Topthorn know that he knows he won.
                         
          The other horses come charging in. There is a real sense of
          achievement and congratulation amongst the regiment.
                         
                          MAJOR STEWART
           He's got speed...I'll give him that. But
           has he got stamina?
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           He has everything.
                         
          The two men enjoy the moment of rivalry and the exhilaration
          of it all. The two horses, face to face rub against each
          other for the first time. A bond has been formed...
           42.
                         
          INT. OFFICERS' STUDY. DAY.
                         
          Stewart enters. A phonograph plays "Roses of Picardy." The
          walls are decorated with etchings of famous battles, and a
          large map of Western Europe that depicts how the English
          troops are crossing the channel to confront the Germans near
          Belgium. Nicholls is writing a letter - though actually at
          this moment, he is making a little pencil drawing of Joey to
          enclose with it.
                         
                          MAJOR STEWART
           What are you up to?
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           I'm writing a letter.
                         
                          MAJOR STEWART
           With a picture in it?
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           It's to the boy who owned Joey. I want to
           show him how wonderful he's looking.
                         
                          MAJOR STEWART
           Before we take him away across the Channel
           to face a million Germans guns.
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           Yes. Before that...
                         
                          MAJOR STEWART
           4 a.m. start tomorrow - travelling with the
           Dragoon Guards and the Royals. Transport
           detachment - they'll need to be at the docks
           at 5 am. Check all kit. Battle orders: no
           polishing - buttons, helmet buckles, stirrup
           irons - let `em all go dull. I want nothing
           to flash in the sun and give us away.
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           Of course.
                         
          As Stewart leaves, he passes Charlie. He casually
          acknowledges him.
                         
                          MAJOR STEWART
           Charlie...

           Charlie.
           43.
                         
          Charlie checks his new cap in the mirror.
                         
                          CHARLIE WAVERLY
           What do you think of the cap?
                         
          He shows the bright red lining to Nicholls.
                         
           CHARLIE WAVERLY (CONT'D)
           Silk lining. I quite like it.
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           I'm not sure it's going to make a lot of
           difference to the Germans.
                         
                          CHARLIE WAVERLY
           Oh, I don't know about that. Think about it -
           you're a Boche, just working out which of
           two chaps to shoot - and you thought - "Good
           Lord - one of them really is wearing a very
           stylish cap indeed!" You might shoot the
           other one instead.
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           Or, alternatively, think - "I fancy that
           cap" and kill you first of all.
                         
          Pause. Charlie removes the cap.
                         
                          CHARLIE WAVERLY
           Hadn't thought of that.
                         
          Nicholls returns to his sketch.
                         
          EXT. DIRT ROAD. FRANCE.
                         
          Three hundred horses and their charges in a slow march in the

          EXT. ROAD. DAY.
                         
          Nicholls and Stewart and Charlie ride on a smooth road past a
          series of posts screened with cloth. They're silhouetted
          against the setting sun.
                         
          EXT. ROAD. DAY.
                         
          The regiment are tense and nervous as they gingerly make
          their way along the country road. Topthorn and Joey sense
          the grim change of atmosphere.
           44.
                         
          EXT. WOODLAND ABOVE A PLAIN. DAY.
                         
          They are in woodland above a plain stretching for miles. A
          small table has been taken out for Stewart and his officers.
          SERGEANT MAJOR SINGH - a turbaned Indian with a magnificent
          moustache dressed in ceremonial garb - explains the lines of
          battle on a map.
                         
           SGT. MAJOR SINGH
           That is our target - the German 11th
           Division - at the moment bivouacked three
           miles to the east of the Menin Road. We have
           been watching them and they have pitched
           tents for the night and lit cooking fires.
           Knock them out - and we could slide in
           behind the German lines and come at them
           from the South at Geluveld.
                          MAJOR STEWART
           Excellent.

           In regiments of horse and men, the
           advantage is ours.
                         
           SGT. MAJOR SINGH
           And we have surprise on our side.
           But the sooner we move, the better -
           we have no assurance they'll still
           be there tomorrow morning.
                         
          Our officers just have a second to take in the news. The day
          has suddenly arrived. The day they have worked for, for so
          long.
                         
                          MAJOR STEWART
           Right. Good. So - today it is.

           SGT. MAJOR SINGH
           The grass to the left is taller than

           Excellent work, Sergeant Major.

           everything. But if it must be done,
           let's do it quickly.
                         
          Nicholls notices Charlie nervously attending his horse.

          As the cry is echoed throughout the regiment, Nicholls
          accepts Joey from an attending soldier.
           46.

          Nicholls takes the red campaign pennant from his pocket and
          threads it through Joey's reins.
                         
          Minutes later - Stewart addresses the men.

          EXT. OVER GROWN CORN FIELD. DAY.
                         
          Cut to an elegant field of tall grass, waving in the gentle
          breeze. Then suddenly three hundred men seem to rise out of
          it. They are in fact our soldiers, mounting their horses -
          but the horses are invisible in the height of the grass.
                         
          Stewart gives a signal. We see the intense anticipation on
          his face. He takes out his sabre.
                         
                          MAJOR STEWART
           Draw swords!
          The men draw their sabres in silence. The birds chirping,
          oblivious.
                         
          Then Nicholls just turns to his two friends and almost
          whispers...
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           Good luck, my friends.
                         
          He pats Joey's side. And then...
                         
                          MAJOR STEWART
           Forward, to walk! Walk...march!
                         
          The regiment begins moving through the field.
           47.
                         
           MAJOR STEWART (CONT'D)
           Forward to canter! Canter...march!
                         
          The men start to float over the grass - swept along by their
          invisible horses, until...
                         
          Suddenly they emerge from the tall grass - the immense power
          of the galloping horses - silence explodes into a violent
          crashing of hooves. The noise is immense, swords are flying
          in the air. Hundreds of horses racing towards the German
          encampment.
                         
          On the German side, TWO SOLDIERS wake to the sound of
          hoofbeats. They pull their tent flap aside to find the
          invincible charge coming towards them. The Germans are
          totally unprepared. We see them scramble back towards tents,
          rush towards their guns - one man pulling up his trousers
          rushes for cover. One German drops some dirty dishes into a
          wash pot, screaming:
                         
                          GERMAN SOLDIER
           Kavallerie!
                         
          Topthorn and Joey race each other like a rerun of their
          practice on Salisbury Plain. The swords and uniforms glint in
          the sun, the German troops look terrified - some run in
          panic, others prepare to stand their ground.
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           CHARGE!
                         
          The British head in for the kill, the men scream battle cries
          with sheer exhilaration.
                         
          We see the horses at close quarters running with all their
          might. Nicholls and Stewart yell as they approach the enemy.
          The surprise attack is a huge success. The first row of
          unprepared Germans are falling...
                         
          The regiment sweeps through the encampment, cutting down
          soldiers and driving the rest in a panicked retreat to the
          tree line.
                         
          But then we see, in the shadows of the forest behind the
                         CAMP --
                         
          A machine gun. No, a line of machine guns - at least twenty
          guns, sandbagged apart - the logical, new, modern defence of
          a garrison. In an instant, the fleeing Germans have manned
          the guns. All now firing.
           48.
                         
          The noise of the blast of bullets drowns out everything else.
          A score of men and horses are suddenly on the ground, it
          happens almost so quickly Joey and Topthorn don't realize
          anything's wrong and find themselves racing straight towards
          the guns. The bullets keep coming, now suddenly half of the
          regiment are on the ground.
                         
          Horse after horse races past the guns into the woods...all of
          them now riderless.
                         
          Nicholls watches helplessly as one of the barrels swings
          towards him. His face goes slack as he realizes he is about
          to die.
                         
          A moment later, Joey runs on - we pan up to see he is running
          on riderless - he has not realized that Nicholls is gone. The
          bullets whizz around his head, but he still runs directly
          ahead. We would always know him by the red pennant Nicholls
          tied on his saddle.
                         
          Joey is now running through the German lines. No one bothers
          to attack him as the German's concentrate their efforts on
          the cavalry behind him. The line of machine guns fire as one,
          decimating the horses and their riders.
                         
          Joey leaps and dances nimbly through the German ranks, but
          suddenly rears up in the confusion, surrounded by Germans.
                         
          Near him, surviving English officers are hauled from their
          horses.
                         
          Stewart wheels back around on Topthorn, sabre in hand. But
          he, too, is quickly surrounded by several Germans with their
          rifles trained on him. A furious GERMAN OFFICER storms over,
          speaks perfect English:
                         
                          GERMAN OFFICER
                          (OUTRAGED)
           What? Did you think that a garrison
           on open ground would go undefended?
           Look at yourself! Who do you think
           you are?!!
                         
          Stewart looks at the Officer - at the guns that surround him -
          and throws down his sabre, stabbing it into the ground. The
          Germans take Stewart from Topthorn.
                         
          Around them, the fields are littered with dead soldiers and
          horses.
           49.
                         
          EXT. BATTLEFIELD. DAY.
                         
          Topthorn appears disoriented and frightened. Suddenly, he
          rears up and bolts from his new German handler, galloping
          over to Joey. The horses briefly nuzzle, but both rear up
          again as they are separated and led past a young German
          soldier, GUNTHER.
                         
          He zeroes in on them, the finest horses.
                         
          A slightly more JUNIOR OFFICER approaches the outraged senior
          officer.

           The others you round up and take to
           base camp - they will pull guns.

           Then shoot them also.
                         
          Gunther, the young private, now standing behind them,
          interjects.
                         
                          GUNTHER
           Sir - perhaps we could use some of
           them with the ambulances - to get
           the injured men off the field.

           I'd like to try, sir.
                         
          The officers move away - that's enough talk about horses...
                         
          CUT ON - Gunther is now with Joey and Topthorn. Near a wooden
          ambulance - which is like a giant wagon to carry humans. He
          is with MICHAEL, a very young soldier, his brother - possibly
          as young as 14.
           50.
                         
          Gunther lifts a heavy pulling harness - and tries to get
          Topthorn into it.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           It won't work - they're cavalry

           Come on, Michael.
                         
          Topthorn balks violently.

           Gunther! It's hopeless - we can't
           help them.
                         
          And suddenly Joey moves up and presents himself, with his
          strange self assurance and self sacrifice. And instinct for
          survival.
                         
          He sniffs the harness and places his head through it, which
          helps to calm Topthorn enough that Gunther can slip the
          collar onto the big black horse. Gunther turns to Joey,
          impressed.
                         
                          GUNTHER
           Well, well, look at you. Whoever
           taught you this has just saved your
           life.
                         
          Gunther spots the red ribbon in Joey's saddle, removes it,
          folds it, and places it in his pocket.
                         
          Later - Gunther and Michael are returning from the
          battlefield with Topthorn and Joey, pulling an ambulance with
          British and German wounded. Amongst the wounded, we see a
          hand gripping a battered, silk lined hat. It is Waverly,
          wounded but alive.

           left you this. Yours, Sergeant Sam
           Perkins.
                         
          Si Easton drops his head guiltily. Rosie catches this.
                         
                          ROSIE
           You weren't to know it was bad news.
                         
                          ALBERT
           He was riding Joey when he died.
                         
                          ROSIE
           You don't know that he was riding
           him...
                         
                          ALBERT
           "In action," it says.
                         
          Everybody falls silent. Albert goes to the fence and looks
          down at the sketches of Joey. Rosie looks at her son, her
          heart breaking for him. Dad returns to the harvest without a
          word. Albert looks off to the horizon and - over there.
                         
          EXT. GERMAN BASE CAMP. EVENING.
                         
          CLOSE -- A step stool.
                         
          Michael mounts the stool next to Joey and Topthorn, removes
          their harnesses and carries them across the road.
                         
          Michael slips and falls into the mud. Gunther dashes over
          and pulls him up just before a military convoy pulls into the
          camp, running over the tack.
                         
          The BASE CAMP OFFICER appears on a motorbike.
           BASE CAMP OFFICER.
           Gentlemen! We move forward to the
           frontline tonight. Full marching
           orders. Get moving!
                         
          As the soldiers hop to their orders, the officer turns to -
                         
           BASE CAMP OFFICER
           Schroeder! Schroeder!
                         
          Both Michael and Gunther turn to him. But it's Gunther the
          Officer wants to talk to.
                         
           BASE CAMP OFFICER (CONT'D)
           No, not you - you. Come.
           53.
                         
          Gunther picks up the dropped harnesses as he approaches.
                         
           BASE CAMP OFFICER (CONT'D)
           I'm keeping you here. You are best
           with the horses and we need to move
           the camp quickly if the enemy
           continue to push through from the
           west.
                         
                          GUNTHER
           They're pushing through?
                         
           BASE CAMP OFFICER
           I'm told. We will move later when we
           find where the horses are needed
           most.
                         
                          GUNTHER
           Yes, sir. Perhaps I can keep my
           brother here with me, he's also very
           good with horses.
                         
           BASE CAMP OFFICER
           Oh no no. Not necessary.
                          (TO MICHAEL)
           Get moving. We leave tonight.
                         
          He walks away. Gunther is stricken by the news, but Michael
          is excited. As he leads Joey past his brother:
                         
                          MICHAEL
           It's all right, Gunther.
                         
          Gunther can't really speak. Michael is just a boy.
                         
          EXT. GERMAN CAMP / VARIOUS. EVENING.
          Soldiers are lifting up their equipment - gathering - moving
          in the same direction.
                         
          In a quiet tent, a few last soldiers are packing. And there
          are Gunther and Michael, packing together.
                         
                          GUNTHER
           You are not going. I'll tell them
           you are only fourteen, that you're a
           boy.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           Father signed me in. He knew my age
           -and so do they.
           54.
                         
          The process of packing is their way of coping with the shock.
          Gunther is folding one of Michael's shirts. Michael takes it
          back...
                         
                          MICHAEL (CONT'D)
           Mother obviously never taught you
           how to fold a shirt.
                         
                          GUNTHER
           Of course she did. I just wasn't
           listening. But you need to listen
           now! I promised her, I made her a
           solemn promise, that you would be
           safe with me. With me, Michael!!
                         
          He leans close to Michael, talking in almost a whisper.
                         
                          GUNTHER (CONT'D)
           They'll never make a head count.
           There are too many of us. You can
           stay here - slip underneath the bed -
           until they move out.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           Then what?
                         
          Michael carries on with his packing.
                         
                          MICHAEL (CONT'D)
           Gunther, it will be fine. And when
           all the machines break down and they
           call up the horses, I'll see you at
           the front. We'll be together again.
                         
          And now the case is packed. Gunther heads to the tent
          opening.
                          MICHAEL (CONT'D)
           Gunther...
                         
          Looking round, the tent is now empty. The moment to leave has
          come. Gunther pulls the red pennant from his pocket and
          follows Michael out of the tent to where the soldiers are
          lining up in the road.
                         
                          GUNTHER
           I'm giving this to you. For luck.
                         
          Gunther ties the pennant to the back of Michael's pack as he
          forms up.
                         
                          GUNTHER (CONT'D)
           To keep you safe.
           55.
                         
          Michael smiles at him and begins to march. Marching towards
          Ypres, on the Western Front.
                         
           BASE CAMP OFFICER
           Im schnellschritt! Marsch...links!
           Zwei, drei, vier!
                         
          We settle on young Michael - in line - he passes Gunther. He
          remains eager. But it is goodbye. These soldiers moving into
          the darkness and towards death. Gunther looks on - tears in
          his eyes. The two horses are uneasy - sensing tension.
                         
          A few minutes later - Gunther grabs a saddle and throws it
          onto Joey's back.
                         
          Back to the soldiers.
                         
          Suddenly we see the galloping legs of two horses. They whip
          past the back of the line of marching soldiers. It's clear
          what is happening - Gunther is on Topthorn - and has hold of
          Joey, on a loose rope, galloping beside him.
                         
          Gunther, galloping along the line of soldiers, spots what he
          is looking for, a red pennant unfurled and flapping in the
          wind, tied onto Michael's pack. Gunther speeds toward him.
          This was his plan all along. And in an instant he is beside
          him and without Michael ever realizing, he suddenly finds his
          arms and legs akimbo, as he is yanked out of the line and
          dragged along the ground, desperately close to Joey's
          pounding hooves.
                         
          Michael looks at the soldiers beside him - he looks at the
          skyline of violence ahead...but before he can decide, he
          feels his brother's arm - pulling him upwards. And now, the
          two of them are fully on Topthorn.
                         
          They leave a jumble of soldiers in their wake as the officers
          try to restore order.
                         
                          GERMAN OFFICER
           Get back in line! Line!
                         
          EXT. WOODS. LATER.
                         
          Michael now rides Joey, following Gunther on Topthorn. The
          brothers look at each other - can't believe what they have
          done - Michael is following his brother, swept along, doesn't
          know if it is right.
                         
          And Michael and Joey and Gunther and Topthorn charge on to
          freedom.
                         
          They spot a lonely house and burst past a line with some
          drying clothes.
           56.
                         
          As they ride, they grab civilian shirts and jackets and
          trousers, the clothes pegs pinging off and falling to the
          ground.
                         
          And on they ride - though all too soon day starts to break in
          the far distance. They see a very dilapidated windmill. They
          aim for it as the sun begins to seriously break over the
          horizon.
                         
          INT. / EXT. WINDMILL. DAWN.
                         
          They reach the windmill. It feels very unused. The machinery
          of the windmill creaks in the dawn. The brothers untether the
          horses, careful now that it is light outside.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           I'm hungry. Did you bring food?
                          GUNTHER
           I'm sorry.
                         
          Michael fingers the pennant on Joey's reins. Then...
                         
                          MICHAEL
           Will Father be ashamed?
                         
                          GUNTHER
           He will pretend to be. Maybe at
           first he will be. But in the end, he
           will be glad.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           And us? What about us?
                         
          Gunther looks at him - but doesn't reply. As Michael removes
                         JOEY'S SADDLE:
                          MICHAEL (CONT'D)
           I was ready to go. I was proud to
           go.

                          SMALL VOICE)
           I wanted to go.
                         
          Later - They sit in silence, waiting for sleep.
                         
                          MICHAEL (CONT'D)
           The food in Italy is good.
                         
                          GUNTHER
           Yes.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           What about the women?
           57.
                         
                          GUNTHER
           Not as good as the food.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           Because...they've eaten too much of
           the food?
                         
                          GUNTHER
           You are too young for war. And
           you're too young for women!
                         
          Gunther laughingly pushes him over.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           I don't feel so young. Not anymore.
                         
                          MICHAEL (CONT'D)
           Michael.
                          MICHAEL (CONT'D)
           What?
                         
                          GUNTHER
           Go to sleep - we have a big night of
           riding ahead. Goodnight, Michael.
                         
          He jokingly strokes Michael's cheek. Michael swats him away,
          but as he settles in the hay:
                         
                          MICHAEL
           Night night, Gunther.
                         
          EXT. WINDMILL. DUSK.
                         
          Gunther and Michael sleep. Suddenly something awakens Joey.
          He stirs and then rises. Hear the sound of engines and see
          lights through the slats sweeping across Joey's face.
          Michael and Gunther are stirring in their sleep as we hear a
          car and several motorcycles approaching. Head-lamps filter
          through the cracks in the windmill walls stabbing the
          brothers awake.
                         
                          GERMAN SOLDIER
           Hei! In die windmühle!
                         
          The boys spring up, speaking in terrified whispers.
                         
                          GUNTHER

                          MICHAEL
           Okay.
           58.
                         
          They race up a nearby ladder, but Michael stumbles against a
          table, upsetting some gear. It clatters loudly. They cower
          as they hear boots tromping up the steps outside. Then the
          windmill doors are thrown open, pinning them in the bright
          headlights of the vehicles.
                         
          As they're marched out, we see what they see: A German car -
          two motorcycles. Six Germans, including the officer who was
          in charge of them.

          Through the turning arms of the windmill, we glimpse the
          double execution. Four rifles fire - flashes of the soldiers
          shooting - the bodies on the ground.

          There are Joey and Topthorn, still waiting.
                         
          And then suddenly - the doors of the windmill creak. The two
          horses turn, immensely aware of the break in the silence. The
          door opens a little - and we see, reflected in Joey's eye, a
          very delicate, beautiful, thirteen-year-old country girl
          (EMILIE).
                         
          She stares at the horses. They stare straight back at her.
          And she walks straight out again, closing the big door behind
          her. Joey and Topthorn settle for a moment.
           59.
                         
          Time transition - Joey and Topthorn are in a slightly
          different place - and the door opens again. It is the same
          little girl - but this time she comes in carrying two buckets
          full of water.

          A small humble farmhouse - and round it, small fields,
          planted with different fruit crops. We see an old man
          (GRANDFATHER), burdened with a basket of berries heading back
          towards the farmhouse.

          He enters the kitchen - which is rough, but full of the
          paraphernalia of jam-making - jars, sieves, pectin, sugar.

          Outside, Emilie has fashioned two jumps. The big one for Joey
          and a little demonstration obstacle for herself. She leads
          Joey to a starting point about 30 yards in front of some
          crates supporting a stick about four feet off the ground.
          The red pennant hangs from the stick. Joey stands quietly as
          Emilie hobbles to the big jump, making a jumping gesture with
          her hand.

          the big jump. From behind her back she produces three big

          quickly but at the last moment veers right and passes between

           Everyone must give their share.
                         
          And suddenly we see what is going to happen - the 20 peasants
          spread out and move through the field - with either bags, or
          using the aprons they wear - picking all the fruits - at just
          the moment all the work has brought forth fruit - and the new
          year's crop is ready.
           65.
                         
          Raspberries, black-currants, gooseberries. In a few minutes,
          everything he lives by will be gone.
                         
          Watching from his car and calmly smoking a cigar is BRANDT,
          the officer in charge of the unit.
                         
          Cut to the fields - the aprons and baskets are getting full.
          They move through the rows of fruit like a plague of locusts.
                         
          Back to the Grandfather - and out of the house comes Emilie.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           They are taking everything. Where
           are the horses?
                         
          Pause.
                         
                          EMILIE
           What horses?
                         
          The sound of jars breaking draws Grandfather and Emilie into
          the kitchen, where the Germans continue to raid their other
          supplies.
                         
          One German picks up waterbath canner -- inspecting it.
                         
                          GERMAN SOLDIER
           What is it?
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           Leave it if you don't know what it's
           for.
                         
                          GERMAN SOLDIER
           A pot is a pot. We'll find some use
           for it. Sir, where's the livestock?
          Brandt sits quietly, casually using his finger to scoop jam
          from an open jar.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           I make jam. We have no animals.
                         
                          GERMAN SOLDIER
           But there's fresh hay in your barn.
                         
          Emilie enters, overhearing.
                         
                          EMILIE
           We use it to replace the mattress
           stuffings.
                         
                          GERMAN SOLDIER
           Her grandfather?
           66.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           Yes.
                         
                          GERMAN SOLDIER
           Where are her parents?
                         
                          EMILIE
                          (BREAKING IN)
           They're dead. They died.
                         
          The German nods and is about to take his leave, putting the
          pot back where he found it, when a clumping noise from
          somewhere in the house begins.
                         
                          GERMAN SOLDIER
           What is that?
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           The wind. It plays tricks in the
           attic.
                         
          Brandt licks his finger and tests:
                         
                          BRANDT
           There is no wind.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           An old house creaks.
                          (TO EMILIE)
           Go - close the shutters.
                         
          Emilie runs out of the room. The soldier picks up the
          medicine bottle.
                         
                          GERMAN SOLDIER
           She's sickly, no?
                          GRANDFATHER
           If you or any of your friends harm
           her, as old as I am, I will kill
           you.
                         
          The soldier looks shocked and then begins to laugh. He slaps
          the medicine flask into Grandfather's chest.
                         
                          GERMAN SOLDIER
           You know, I was going to give you
           back your pot. But now I'm going to
           keep it. For soup.
                         
          He slings the huge pot he had put back up on his shoulder and
          leaves the house with the other soldiers.
           67.
                         
                          BRANDT
           We will be back in the new season.
                         
          As the Germans leave, we cut to the upstairs bedroom where
          Emilie lies curled up on the bed - and there, standing on
          either side of the bed - are the two horses. They look huge
          in the tiny room.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN. LATE THAT NIGHT.
                         
          The sound of shells exploding. A huge bombardment somewhere
          in the deep distance. But much closer than before. The
          distant, malicious giants of war growl.
                         
          It is like a lightning storm on the horizon.
                         
          The kitchen has been emptied. The war has finally come to
          them - and we can see it on Emilie's face.
                          EMILIE
           Tell me what happened to them. To my
           mother and father.
                         
          Grandfather doesn't respond.
                         
                          EMILIE (CONT'D)
           You said you would tell me how they
           died. On my birthday. And tomorrow's
           my birthday! They died fighting,
           didn't they? But when the soldiers
                          COME -
                         
          She finally turns to face him.
                         
                          EMILIE (CONT'D)
           - you do nothing. You are a coward,
           aren't you?
                          GRANDFATHER
           Yes. Yes. It was your parents who
           were brave. I make jams.
                         
                          EMILIE
           And you've never done a brave thing
           in your life?
                         
          He eases himself into a chair and shrugs.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           Maybe there are different ways to be
           brave. Did you know the French have
           the best carrier pigeons? And this
           could be the difference in the war -
           our messages getting through.
           68.
                         
                          EMILIE
           I don't want to hear about the
           birds.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           They are released at the front and
           told to go home - this is all they
           know. But to get there they must
           fly over a war. Can you imagine
           such a thing? Here you are flying
           over so much pain and terror - and
           you know you can never look down.
           You have to look forward or you'll
           never get home. I ask you - what
           could be braver than that?
                         
          Emilie sheds a single tear.
          INT. THE BARN. DAWN.
                         
          Grandfather enters the barn, strokes Topthorn's nose as he
          passes. He sweeps aside a rug from the barn floor, to reveal
          a trap door. Then, he opens it.
                         
          Now from out of the trap door, he lifts a big ungainly
          object, covered in another rug.
                         
          INT. FARMHOUSE KITCHEN. MORNING.
                         
          Emilie comes down the stairs as Grandfather waits proudly by
          the stove. She stops when she sees the OBJECT COVERED BY THE
          RUG.
                         
                          EMILIE
           What is that?
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           A present.
                         
          Emilie moves toward the object that is covered.
                         
                          EMILIE
           I hope you have not bought me a
           disgusting dress that I then have to
           wear like last year.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
                          (LAUGHING)
           It was disgusting?
                         
                          EMILIE
           Yes. I looked like an ugly nun.
           69.
                         
          Then she stops herself and turns to Grandfather with a
          parental rebuke.
                         
                          EMILIE (CONT'D)
           Give me your hand.
           (she takes it in hers)
           Grandpére, we have no money. When
           the war is over, then you can buy me
           jewels and carriages.
                         
          The grandfather smiles and gives Emily a hug.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           Anything you say, my sweet one.
           Anything-you-say! You are, of
           course, the boss. It's just an old
           thing I found - don't worry yourself
           - leave it, I'll put it back.
          He leaves the room. Now Emilie is alone and she can't help it
          when she brings her eyes back to the object covered by the
          rug. She looks back over her shoulder to make sure she's not
          being watched and then lifts one corner of the rug. Her face
          explodes with a gorgeous smile. She pulls off the rug that
          is covering the big thing and...it is a gorgeous old saddle.
          She runs her hand along the saddle -- can hardly believe it.
                         
          INT. A HILL. JUST BEYOND THE FARMHOUSE. NEAR THE WINDMILL.
          DAY.
                         
          Grandfather helps to swing Emilie up and into the saddle.
          All at once, the Grandfather's charity evaporates.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           It was your mother's. I hid it, so
           as not to encourage you. Emilie, I
           want you to ride very slowly, very
           carefully. And promise me you won't
           go far --
                         
                          EMILIE
           Of course. Okay, I promise.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           To the top of the hill and straight
           back again.
                         
                          EMILIE
           I promise.
                         
          Emilie unties her hair and tosses the red pennant to
          Grandfather, releasing her hair to spill down her back and
          shoulder.
           70.

           My hero.
                         
          She sets off on Joey - and quickly spurs him to a gallop.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           Slowly...slowly...
                         
          She rides - past the windmill - and then over the top of a
          nearby hill - she speeds over it and out of sight.
                         
          Back to the hill - a sudden change of mood. An empty shot. No
          movement, no returning girl.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER (CONT'D)
           Emilie!
                         
          Cut again to the top of the hill, then back to the
          Grandfather, very worried.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER (CONT'D)
           Emilie!
                         
          Topthorn suddenly rears up - and charges off following,
          sensing danger. Grandfather starts to run in the direction of
          the hill.
                         
          Topthorn charging over the brow of the hill.
                         
          The Grandfather running - out of breath.
                         
          He hears an indistinct scream from Emilie!
                         
          He reaches the top of the hill - comes over the brow - and
          there is not the fallen body of Emilie, which he has been
          fearing, but a brutal line of German soldiers - and
          motorbikes. It is like a line of Indians in a Western -
          total, alien fear.
                         
          And there amongst them is Emilie, astride a panicked Joey,
          surrounded by soldiers. Another one holds Topthorn, who bucks
          and rears, but to no avail. Grandfather starts down the hill
          towards his granddaughter.
                         
          EXT. GERMAN COLUMN NEAR THE WINDMILL. THE SAME
                         
          The Germans are moving through the horses they have gathered.
          Emilie, unhorsed, tries to get to Joey, who is being roughly
          led away by a German soldier.
                         
                          EMILIE
           No! Let go of me! No!
           71.
                         
          Grandfather grabs her. She is screaming. He tries to calm her
          down. Joey is tied up as is Topthorn. Emilie is kicking and
          screaming - but also desperately short of breath.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           She is my granddaughter! Emilie,

           They look strong - should last a

          FRIEDRICH is an unprepossessing, chubby man. He marvels at
          Topthorn.
                         
                          FRIEDRICH

          But then he looks to the other horses penned nearby, haggard
          and weak. He turns to Joey.
                         
                          FRIEDRICH (CONT'D)

           Such a pity...
                         
          In a strange way, there are many humans Joey meets, but also
          just one, the spirit of goodness and consideration for
          animals, joined by little echoes throughout the film.
                         
          And then they go over a ridge - and we suddenly see the
          explanation of Friedrich's comment. The road they can see
          below them is the main through road of the area - and it is a
          scene of horse horror - huge, massive guns and cannons and
          artillery being dragged by teams of horses that are in a
          terrible condition.
                         
          For Joey and Topthorn, this is a moment like when soldiers
          arrived to liberate the prisoners who had been kept in Changi
          prison by the Japanese during World War 2. They have never
          seen horses in this condition. You can see in their eyes the
          confusion. This is a whole different world, where horses can
          turn into creatures that look like this.
           73.
                         
          And it is also a vision of their future. This may be the
          moment the mighty Topthorn begins to lose hope. For Joey it
          is another level of knowledge - another mighty thing he will
          fight through - because he always fights through.

          Joey rears up and escapes his groom. He gallops up the hill

          The convoy struggles up the hill. Joey feels the dead weight
          of the gun. These are several tons of cast iron - almost
          dwarfing the horses. Friedrich notices. Together, this grim
          circus struggles along the pot-holed country road in the
          rain.
           75.
                         
          Joey leads the team up the incline. Each step is an immense
          effort. The going, over rough scree, is very tough indeed. It
          is very difficult for Joey to get a foothold on the loose
          ground, but his experience in Dartmoor comes into play and
          although he almost loses his balance several times he stays
          upright and hauls the cannon - Fitzcarraldo-like - over the
          hill.
                         
          We follow his progress step by step. Friedrich watches
          anxiously. Soldiers strain at the sides of the gun. One
          throws boards under the wheels to aid in traction. As they
          reach the top of the hill it almost seems the effort is too
          much, the cannon always in danger of rolling back. Joey
          finally staggers over the top - it feels as though the
          tethers are going to snap with the strain - but at last the
          cannon reaches the peak, the crest of the hill.

          With the barrage lifted, the British soldiers that are
          huddled in a low sub-trench, are ordered back on the line.

                          (TO ANDREW)
           Stay here.
                         
          Albert follows David down the trench.
                         
                          ALBERT (CONT'D)
           Remember that day me and Joey raced
           you in your car?
                         
                          DAVID
           I remember you somersaulting through
           the air.
                         
                          ALBERT
           Who was that girl you were with?
                         
                          DAVID
           There was a girl?
                         
          Albert nods.
                         
                          ALBERT
           There was. Don't you remember?
           78.
                         
                          DAVID
           It was just some girl, I suppose. I
           don't recall which one. I do
           remember you falling on your bum in
           a ditch.
                         
          Andrew laughs amiably. David points to him, smirking.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           You see? Always entertaining,
           Narracott, I'll give you that.
                         
          As David walks on, Andrew smiles at Albert.
                         
                          ANDREW
           You did that? You fell on your bum?
                         
          Albert leaves without answering. Andrew keeps smiling until
          a large shell explodes nearby. Troops surge towards their
          ladders as officers scream indistinct orders.
                         
          Now David leads his troop through the trenches to the front
          line where they stop, lean against the enemy-side wall
          nervously and wait - each man in private contemplation.
                         
          Sergeant Martin moves along the lines, pushing men forward.
                         
                          SERGEANT MARTIN
           Be ready! Be ready! Let's go, men,
           get ready to go! Get ready to move
           out! Stay in position!
                         
          David calls out from atop a trench ladder.
                         
                          DAVID
           Hold your nerve, boys. Remember,
           it's not far to go. There's a way
           through.

           Run fast, keep your wits about you,
           keep your eyes open and God and the

           Company will fix bayonets! Fix
           bayonets!
                         
          The echo of `fix bayonets' goes down the line - and every man
          fixes the brutal shining bayonet to the end of his gun.
                         
          Then Albert turns to Andrew.
                         
                          ALBERT
           You know what it reminds me of out
           there?

                          ANDREW
           What?
                         
                          ALBERT
           That bloody impossible lower field
           the day me and Joey plowed it. Best
           day of my life that was and you were
           there.
                         
                          ANDREW
           And this here is the worst day of my
           life, about to begin, and you're
           here cheering me on. Us two, always.
           And him.
                         
          He nods at David Lyons, who gives instructions to another
          soldier.
                          DAVID
           Once you're in no man's land, go to
           the flanks. Stay on the flanks.
                         
                          SOLDIER
           Yes, sir.
                         
          David turns to Albert and Andrew.
                         
                          DAVID
           Come on, boys, come on. To the
           ladder!
                         
                          ALBERT
                          (TO ANDREW)
           Stick close to the gentry, that's
           our ticket, yeah? We have the pluck
           but they have the luck.
          They both smile. And then the fear takes over again. Andrew
          particularly feels as though he is on the very edge now.
          David urges them forward.
                         
                          DAVID
           You, too, Narracott.
                          (TO ANDREW)
           And you, too.
                         
          Andrew and Albert pass by the bucket. They throw some
          valuables in. But a moment later, Albert goes back to the
          bucket and pulls something out - a worn piece of paper - he
          unfolds it - it is the little sketch that Captain Nicholls
          drew of Joey the night before they left for France. He slips
          it inside his shirt, next to his heart.
           80.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           Come on, on your ladders, boy. On
           your ladders. In you go, in you go.
           That's it.
                         
          Andrew turns towards a ladder. As fate and placement would
          have it - he is first in line. He puts his foot on the
          ladder, when suddenly the Sergeant stops him.
                         
                          SERGEANT MARTIN
           Listen to your sergeant!
                         
          He pulls Andrew aside, speaking so that everyone can hear.
                         
           SERGEANT MARTIN (CONT'D)
           If anybody turns back, if any one of
           our boys come running towards you -
           you take this rifle and you shoot
           them dead. Do you understand?
                         
                          SOLDIERS
           Yes, sir!
                         
          The sergeant pushes in on Andrew, private and intense.
                         
                          SERGEANT
           Do you understand me? Do you
           understand what I'm telling you,
           son? You take this rifle and you
           shoot them dead. Understand?
                         
          Andrew looks ready to cry, but manages to nod. Albert turns
          to him, only to be pushed back by the sergeant.
                         
                          SERGEANT (CONT'D)
           Up there, son. Up your ladder. Up
           your ladder to your work!
          Albert looks nervously back at Albert, comforting.
                         
                          ALBERT
           It's good. Andrew, it's good.
           Andrew! Nobody's retreating today.
           Andrew! Andrew! Nobody. Is
           retreating. Today.
                         
          The COMMANDER arrives, checks the time on his AIDE's watch,
          mounts his ladder and blows a whistle to signal the charge.
          A BAGPIPER plays as the men go over the top.
                         
          David now heads up the ladder first. Gun fire overhead,
          Albert steels himself, then hauls himself over the top,
          followed by the next man and the next.
           81.
                         
          Immediately machine gun fire whistles past, we hear the
          screams of the first men who are shot. We follow Albert.
                         
          We are him. His vision. His experience. The ground is
          blasted, there are bodies all around him. He tries to run but
          his feet sink into the mud. Bullets fly past him. Felled men
          are screaming at his feet in fear and agony. Albert staggers
          forward. David is now right by him. They run together. Albert
          looks round and suddenly, David is hit. He falls to the
          ground, screaming.
                         
                          DAVID
           I'm shot! No!
                         
          Albert instinctively goes to help. Bullets shower all around
          him.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           Just leave me. Leave me!
                         
          Albert grabs him and drags him onwards with him - David
          screaming at the pain - Albert grimly determined. Shells
          explode around them as they stumble on. Other men are
          running and falling. Albert sees cover in a huge shell-hole
          so dives into it for a moment's reprieve from the gun fire.
          He sits in still terror for a moment.
                         
                          ALBERT
           You'll be all right here. You'll be
           safe. Someone'll come for ya.
                         
                          DAVID
           Albert. Albert, listen...
                         
                          ALBERT
           It's all right. It's all right.
           We're Devon boys, yeah?
          David looks at Albert as though seeing him for the first
          time.
                         
                          DAVID
           Yeah...
                         
          Albert races onward.
                         
          Back at the trench, Andrew waits - terrified - and then, back
          out of the mist step two men - heading back towards him. Then
          a third. They suddenly catch sight of Andrew waiting there
          with his gun pointed towards them. They slow down - in the
          terror of the assault, they had forgotten that death was
          waiting for them if they turned back.
           82.
                         
          Time seems to slow down - Andrew shifts his gun from pointing
          at one - to the other - we see their individual faces. They
          are all just boys really.
                         
          And suddenly, instinct hits Andrew - he charges up the
          ladder, and forward, firing - past the three men, towards the
          enemy. He chooses his death instead of theirs. A sudden
          barrage of machine gun fire all around him.
                         
          Cut back to Albert, who makes his way to the edge of the
          shell hole. Bullets whizz inches from his head. He looks over
          to see a German machine gun position to his right. Bullets
          whizz past forcing him to duck.
                         
          Andrew charges past other soldiers, ignoring their warnings.
                         
                          RANDOM SOLDIER
           Get down!
          Albert continues forward to dive into another shell hole,
          nearer to the German line. He scrambles from shell hole to
          shell hole. Now he's very close to the machine gun position.
                         
          Albert takes a grenade, fumbles with the pin as his hands
          tremble. He finally gets the pin out and he hurls the
          grenade at the machine gunner. We see the explosion and the
          machine gun stop. Albert sprints over the top again and makes
          it all the way into the German trench.
                         
          Albert runs through the trench, which seems curiously empty.
          Albert swings round as he sees the startling face of a gas-
          masked German holding a rifle on him.
                         
          Albert readies his bayonet but the man is dead, slumped
          backwards against the side of the trench still upright.
          Albert spins round, his bayonetted rifle in front of him,
          ready for action, but there is only the ghostly sight of dead
          German soldiers.
                         
          Albert is alone, everyone else is dead. All the dead wear
          gas masks.
                         
          More British soldiers drop into the trench, among them
          Andrew. He stumbles in the mud, drops his rifle, recovers
          it, and races through the trench.
                         
          He glimpses Albert ahead of him, stalking through the mist.
          Andrew breaks into a smile and rushes forward, prompting
          Albert to whirl with his rifle raised.
                         
                          ANDREW
           NO!
           83.
                         
          Albert pauses just in time. Then he collapses against the
          side of the trench, overwhelmed.
                         
                          ANDREW (CONT'D)
           Albie.
                         
          Andrew grabs Albert and holds him up, embracing him. Albert
          can barely whisper:
                         
                          ALBERT
           We made it. We made it.
                         
          A moment later, the pair of them hurry through the trenches.
          Albert spots more comrades around a corner and calls ahead to
          Andrew.
                         
                          ALBERT (CONT'D)
           Andrew, this way out!
          Suddenly ANOTHER SOLDIER leaps from a trench branch between
          them, shouting in panic.
                         
                          SOLDIER
           Gas! Gas! Gas!
                         
          An instant later, a gas cloud blasts through the trench.
          Andrew and Albert look in horror. It spreads towards them,
          too powerful to avoid. Andrew is closest, turns to Albert
          with a helpless -

          Topthorn is limping.
                         
          Something is wrong - Topthorn seems to be failing - he coughs
          badly, breathes strangely. Friedrich stops to check on him.
          An officer notices.

           Sir, there's something wrong. This
           one needs to rest.
                         
                          GERMAN OFFICER
           There's no rest for them. Move them
           along. Move them along!
                         
          Instead, Friedrich leads the horses under the cover of a low
          bridge for a brief respite. A moment later, Topthorn
          collapses.
                         
                          FRIEDRICH
           Please, please, please. Stay on
           your feet. No, please. No no no...
                         
          Friedrich tries to help Topthorn valiantly struggling to get
          up but finally sinks to the ground again. This time he lies
          semi-conscious. He is dying.
                         
                          FRIEDRICH (CONT'D)
           Please please... Stay on your feet.
                         
          Joey deeply upset nuzzles his nose into Topthorn but the life
          drains out him. Friedrich is in panic at Topthorn's quick
                         DECLINE:
                         
                          FRIEDRICH (CONT'D)
           Come on. Please please...
                         
          Friedrich continues to stroke Topthorn's head. Joey pushes
          Topthorn as if to stop him falling into unconsciousness. For
          a moment we think Topthorn will come round but he slips away
          and all life leaves his body. Friedrich solemnly strokes the
          horse, knowing all is lost.
                         
          Joey does not understand. He pulls at Topthorn's reins, as if
          trying to pull him upright. Topthorn's body is inert, his
          head falls to the earth. Joey will not give up, he pulls at
          him desperately not understanding that Topthorn has died.
                         
          Suddenly, Friedrich looks around. Chaos - all the German
          soldiers stream back past their position, scrambling to get
          their guns and helmets. An officer charges down the bank next
          to the bridge, screaming orders at Friedrich.
                         
                          GERMAN OFFICER
           They're coming! Leave it, private!
                         
          Friedrich tries to pull Joey away to safety but Joey will not
          leave Topthorn's body. Friedrich pulls at Joey, but Joey is
          too lost in his grief to care about or even notice the
          danger.
           85.
                         
           GERMAN OFFICER (CONT'D)
           Leave it! Come with me!
                         
                          FRIEDRICH
           Go to hell!
                         
          The officer nods to two other soldiers who pull Friedrich to
          safety. As he's dragged away, he screams at Joey:
                         
                          FRIEDRICH (CONT'D)
           Run. Run! Run! Run!
                         
          But this is all background noise to Joey's profound refusal
          to accept Topthorn is dead. He paws at the ground next to
          Topthorn, a horse standing over his best friend in a field,
          and he will never leave him.
                         
          And then suddenly - from around a blind turn in the
          streambed, a huge, remorseless tank turns, heading right for
          Joey. He bolts, galloping down the streambed, until he
          reaches a barbed wire barrier - a dead end. He attempts to
          run up the banks, but they're blocked, as well. He rears up,
          but the tank keeps advancing.
                         
          The tank is about to crush Joey. He has left it too late. He
          is about to die.
                         
          But then, counter-intuitively, he runs straight towards the
          tank and...leaps over it - a leap he learnt from Emilie. Then
          scrambles up and over it and leaps down behind.
                         
          Joey keeps on running. He is wild, frightened.
                         
          EXT. COUNTRYSIDE / VILLAGE / TRENCH. THE SAME.
                         
          Joey is free - in countryside - but there is blood pouring
          from his leg, clearly torn by his encounter with the tank. He
          runs on - it is becoming night - suddenly there are
          explosions to the left of him - this fast, elegant creature
          simply runs through the gaps between explosions.
                         
          But as he charges on - the sky lights up in the direction he
          is heading. He is suddenly in the thick of battle. A shell
          explodes next to him, and he leaps entirely over a trench.
          Another explosion sends him leaping, but not far enough - he
          finds himself crashing downwards, and into a trench - and he
          races through it - and finds himself charging towards a
          German company. Both sides are equally startled - Joey
          charging through a thin trench lined with German soldiers -
          the soldiers, finding a live horse careering through them.
                         
          In desperation, Joey scrambles out of the trench - and once
          again, rushes away from the fighting...
           86.
                         
          But now it is very dark indeed - he is stumbling as he runs -
          there is blood mixed with the mud on his legs.
                         
          Now it is total night - fog - confusion - he jumps again. And
          now everywhere there are potholes - the land is massively
          uneven - shells are exploding all around. And suddenly sees
          in front of him barbed wire. He crashes through it - more -
          he bursts through again - now dragging barriers behind him -
          the barriers tangle, pulling him up short - he flips and
          lands amongst even more barbed wire.
                         
          He pulls and turns to release himself but it is impossible.
          The more he pulls, the more firmly he is trapped. He rises
          up, wild, magnificent, a beast fighting for his life.
                         
          He is completely trapped. He cannot move. He cannot see. He
          is in pain. He falls. It feels like an end.

          A young soldier, a Geordie, is on look-out duty. He looks
          through a periscope. He alerts his colleague in his thick,
          northern, Newcastle accent.

          There's no fire from the German trenches. Muttering to

           The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not

          The Geordie walks very slowly across the mud - there are
          bodies - the ground squelches beneath his feet. He waves his
          handkerchief as he walks. He crosses a narrow bridge that
          spans a flooded bomb crater.
                         
          Joey, lying on his side, wrapped head to toe in barbed wire,
          covered in mud, watches Geordie approach. When Geordie gets
          too close, Joey freaks out and begins thrashing about. Joey
          whinnies a high scream of pain, because wire is cutting into
          his hide in several places, and as he thrashes it cuts him
          deeper. Particularly worrisome is a strand that's wrapped
          around his head, crossing right over his eye, threatening to
          slash it. The Geordie calls out in a soothing voice:

          He reaches Joey and surveys the formidable tangle of wire in
          which Joey's bundled. The Geordie soothes and at the same
          time gingerly tests other strands, trying to figure out where
          to begin.

           OW! DAMN! OW!!
                         
          There's a noise behind him, and the Geordie turns around to
          see the Peter (the German from the trench) standing several
          feet away, holding some wire cutters.
                         
                          PETER
           I thought perhaps you might need
           these.
          He holds out the wire cutters. The Geordie, still
          frightened, stares stupidly at them.
                         
                          PETER (CONT'D)
           For the barbed wire?
                         
                          GEORDIE
           Yeah, yeah I... Ummm, thanks.
           Cheers. Cheers...
                         
          He reaches out and takes the proffered cutters.
                         
                          GEORDIE (CONT'D)
           Thanks.
                         
          He returns to Joey, nervous about turning his back. He tries
          to figure out where to begin cutting. He lifts a long strand
          of wire that wraps around Joey's neck, stretches across his
          shoulder and torso and around one of his front legs. He puts
          the wire in the crux of the cutters and is preparing to snip
          when Peter steps closer to him.
                         
                          PETER
           That...That's a very long strand.
           When you cut it, it's going to
           release this -
                         
          He points to a wire wrapped around the wire the Geordie's
          lifting. Then he points to two other wires, similarly
                         ENTANGLED:
                         
                          PETER (CONT'D)
           - and this, and this, and they'll
           coil back rather violently, which
           I'm afraid will only wound the poor
           fellow further.
           91.
                         
          The Geordie nods.
                         
                          GEORDIE
           You speak good English.

           I speak English well.
           (re: the cutters)
           May I?
                         
          The Geordie hands them over and Peter surveys the wires.
                         
                          PETER (CONT'D)
           What if we cut his head free first?
           So he won't try to stand up and
           blind himself? And then -
                         
                          GEORDIE
           Pity you didn't bring a second pair.
           Then I could cut the wire here -
                         
          He points to one of the wires entangled with the strand he'd
          been prepared to cut.
                         
          Peter stands and shouts in the direction of his trench.
                         
                          PETER
           WE NEED MORE WIRE CUTTERS!
                         
          All at once one, two, three, six pairs of cutters come
          soaring through the air and splash into the watery crater.
                         
          Moments later - Peter and the Geordie kneel beside Joey, each
          with a pair of cutters.
                         
          Joey is calming down again.
          The Geordie positions himself across Joey's body so that when
          he's cut the wire, it won't coil back and cut Joey. Peter
          positions himself to be able to cut the two wires in quick
          succession, holding the first wire to stop it from springing
          back.
                         
          Joey's completely still now.
                         
          Peter points between Joey's eyes.
                         
                          PETER (CONT'D)
           His blind spot. The cutters won't
           frighten him. If you could cut
           here, holding this wire -
                         
          He points to wires that intersect the wire that crosses
          Joey's eye. Then he points to the wire across Joey's eye.
           92.
                         
                          PETER (CONT'D)
           I could -

           Say no more, I'm right behind you.
                         
          As they reposition themselves, the Geordie says to Joey:
                         
                          GEORDIE (CONT'D)
           And you understand what's happening,
           do you not, O Best Beloved? That you
           must lay so very nice and still.
           There's a lad, you're a remarkable
           horse, you are, helping us help you.
           There's a lad. There's a remarkable
           lad.
                         
          The Geordie looks into Joey's huge eye as he and Peter get to
          work on their cutting. Joey returns his gaze.
                         
                          GEORDIE (CONT'D)
           So how's things in yonder trench?
                         
                          PETER
           Delightful. We read, we knit
           sweaters, and we train our rats to
           perform circus tricks.
                         
                          GEORDIE
           Well, if ever you need any more
           rats, we can always send ours over.
           `Cause we've more than we need,
           strictly speaking. Besides, they
           scare off all the pretty girls.
                         
                          PETER
           Our girls aren't afraid of rats.
                          GEORDIE
           Big strapping German girls, eh? Kind
           what gives robust massages?
                         
          They laugh.
                         
                          PETER
           Every Thursday! And they bring rum
           cake on your birthday.
                         
          Both men smile at this while Joey is completely still; they
          work quickly, in concert, cutting the horse's head free of
          the wire.
           93.
                         
          Joey raises his head, gives it a shake, neighs and then stirs
          a little. The two soldiers smile at one another. Then they
          set about cutting the rest of the wire; it's much easier now.
                         
          The Geordie cuts through the last wire binding Joey's legs.
          The two soldiers help as the horse staggers upright.
                         
                          GEORDIE
           Look at that horse! Look at the
           muscles he's got, them long legs.
           They're made for running, horses.
           Runnin' away from danger.
                         
                          PETER

           What a strange beast you've become.
                         
          The Geordie grabs hold of Joey's halter, though Joey shows no
          sign of running.
                         
          Joey is finally free.

          is led past the broken and wounded soldiers who look at him

          draws breath - before he steps forward to take aim. Joey is
          totally still, sensing the atmosphere.
          The sergeant cocks his pistol.

          INT. STABLES, DAY.
                         
          Albert puts on a brave face as he collects Joey and leads him
          out of the stables in silence.
                         
          EXT. THE STABLES, THE SAME.
                         
          As Albert comes out the men have gathered. There's a strange
          sense of optimism, for such a gloomy moment. The Geordie
          comes up to Albert and hands him a sheaf of pound notes.
                         
                          GEORDIE
           We've all clubbed together. It's everything
           we have. There's twenty-nine pounds there.

           The Major put in ten.
                         
          The Geordie flashes a sly wink.

          He turns to indicate David Lyons, who nods at Albert
          solemnly.
                         
                          GEORDIE (CONT'D)
           - even asked the Major to say that
           Joey was his, an officer's horse, so
           that he could go back with the
           others.
                         
          Albert is amazed. He is about to show his gratitude when the
          sergeant major shouts:
                         
                          SERGEANT FRY
           Come on, Narracott! Get a move on. We don't
           want to miss the show.
                         
          Albert snaps to attention and begins to lead Joey out of the
          parade ground with the other horses.
                         
          As they walk off, the sergeant silently adds some of his own
          money to the notes in Albert's hand.

          is led into the pen.

           You're alright. Nobody's gonna bid more than
           fifteen for a thoroughbred. They want work
           horses.
                         
          The auctioneer starts the bidding on Joey.

           Four pounds.
                         
          The farmers seem disinterested, shaking of heads. The bidding
          starts. Five pounds, six, seven, now it goes slowly, eight,
          nine, ten. Albert looks pleased at how it's going. He feels
          the cash in his hand. It seems to stick on ten, then a new
          hand comes up at the back of the auction - it is a nasty
          looking moustached man.

          Everyone looks at Albert who is devastated. Albert is
          reeling. He hears the auctioneer repeat the final amount and
          brings down his gavel.

          The Grandfather leads Joey away. Joey pulls, firmly but not
          wildly, on the rein the grandfather's holding. The
          grandfather lets go.
           107.
                         
          He watches as Joey walks to Albert and nuzzles him. They have
          a moment together. The Grandfather watches carefully.
                         
          Albert puts his face right near Joey - speaks gently.

           been. Lucky since the day I met you.
                         
          He quietly hands over the reins.

          Suddenly, we are back in the village in Devon, in the fold of
          the valley. Dusk light. A figure approaches, silhouetted
          against the setting sun.
                         
          Mrs. Naracott gathers the harvest, then notices as the figure
          makes its way up the road to the farm.
                         
          A man in uniform. On a magnificent horse. Mrs. Narracott
          meets them at the gate and we can finally see them clearly -
          Albert and Joey.
          Albert dismounts and removes his cap. An instant later, Mrs.

          Ted opens the gate to stand before his son. Albert slips
          something from his pocket and lets it unfurl in his hand -
