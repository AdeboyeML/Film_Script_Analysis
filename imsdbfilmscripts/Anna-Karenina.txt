          Anna's smile is her acting out a mock-mysteriousness.
                         
                          ANNA
           I know everything.
                         
          She has moved alphabet letters around to spell out VRONSKY. She laughs
          at Kitty's tearful, joyful nodding, genuinely happy for Kitty.
                         
                          ANNA (CONT'D)

           got married . . .
                         
          A quiet note of regret hangs in the air between them for a moment before
          Anna dispels it.
                         
                         
          INT. RECEPTION ROOM, OBLONSKY HOUSE--NIGHT
                         
          With only a lamp or two lit, and the door open, Anna sits alone at the
          card table, with a neglected book, one hand playing idly with the alpha-
          bet bricks. Their pleasant clicks are the only sound as she remains lost in
          thought. She closes her book, marking the place. She is going to go up to bed.
          She hears the sound of the doorbell.

           there a message?
                         
          Vronsky glances up and sees Anna looking down. Their eyes meet. A second
          passes. Vronsky is about to speak. Anna turns away and moves out of his
          view, towards further stairs, with her book.

          Levin is coming home in a sleigh, driven by his one-eyed coachman, Ignat.
          He is huddled under a bearskin blanket. The house is in sight.
                         
          The sleigh overtakes a Peasant Woman, Serafina, walking to the house car-
          rying a big bundle of willow wands strapped to her back: a strong young
          woman with a handsome face. She stops and bows her head. Levin looks at
          her. She then looks him in the face.
                         
          Laska, barking joyfully, races from the house.

          The bathhouse has a stove which heats water. There is a brazier to create
          instant steam, but not now. Levin, almost naked, lies on a plank deck,
          thoughtful, staring at something . . . no, at someone: Serafina, who is put-
          ting on her clothes. Postcoitum. She has no angst. Dressed, she crosses herself.
                         
                          LEVIN
           Will you go to confession?
                         
          Serafina nods indifferently.
                         
                          LEVIN (CONT'D)

                          LEVIN
           "Not according to my deserts, O Lord,
           but according to thy mercy"--that's a fine
           prayer. But I'm full of doubt. Sometimes I
           even doubt that God exists.
                         
                          SERAFINA

          This is a gilded affair, conducted by a Master of Ceremonies. The Host
          and Hostess are positioned to welcome each guest. Dancing has started-- a
          waltz.
                         
          Kitty and her parents enter the ballroom and are received by their hosts.
          Everything has come together for Kitty--her dress, her hair, her skin, her
          moment. She radiates happiness. An Officer stands aside to let them pass,
          openly admiring Kitty, smoothing his moustache. A Youth having trouble
          with his white tie hurries past but turns back to Kitty.

          Just as Vronsky is about to bow, she takes Oblonsky's arm and he whirls
          her away. Kitty smiles for Vronsky but his eyes have followed Anna, know-
          ing she cut him. He remembers himself after an awkward hiatus. Kitty's
          mother and father are watching from afar. Vronsky obliges. He invites her
          into the waltz.

          At the end of the waltz, Vronsky leaves Kitty with her mother, bows and

          Boris the Youth pops up to claim his dance. Dancing, Kitty sees Vronsky
          talking to a couple of Officers. She is anxious but not disillusioned.
                         
          Grumpy Prince Shcherbatsky is dancing with Countess Nordston.

          Anna watches the dancing. She rejects an offer with a smile. She sees Vron-

          She turns away at once, and notices that ladies are curtseying and men are
          bowing as the Host and Hostess escort an overweight but glittering young
          couple towards a decorative buffet in an adjoining salon: the Austrian
          royal honeymooners . . . attended by the Guards Officer from the station.
          Anna stands and curtseys as they pass by into the salon . . . where Oblonsky
          is roaring with laughter, champagne in hand.

          enthusiastic, inexpert Boris.
                         
          Suddenly, Vronsky is at Anna's side.

          Kitty looks for Vronsky, can't see him, then is taken aback to see him with
          Anna. Kitty watches Anna dancing. Anna says something which makes
          Vronsky laugh. Anna laughs. Anna blossoms in front of Kitty's eyes. Vron-
          sky twirls Anna around and she comes smiling into his arms.
                         
          It goes on like that. Kitty watches them from within the arms of young men,
          old men, from the wall. Anna and Vronsky dance slow, they dance fast,

          Anna has a reading lamp hooked over her armrest, and a novel. She cuts
          a page with a paper-knife. But the book cannot hold her. She is reading
          without taking it in. She turns back a page and tries again, but almost at
          once she turns to the window where the dark reflection of her face looks back
          at her. Kitty's face staring as she stared at Anna, betrayed.

          snowflakes through the station but the roof keeps off the snow. She is glad of

          Discreet Footmen move chairs to accommodate the guests who move to join
          one of the conversation circles that make a buzz in the room. Betsy sits by
          the samovar with her little court, including Tuskevich. The Guests include

          The Karenin coach arrives. It's Anna arriving at Betsy's. She enters the
          house in almost unseemly haste. Several coaches are waiting.

          Anna enters. Faces turn to her. She glances around. She knows at once
          that Vronsky isn't there. Betsy beckons to her across the room. Anna, self-
          possessed, smiling, nodding to friends, pressing a hand held out to her,
          offering the other hand to be kissed, glides through a crowd of Betsy's guests.

          There is a series of minor explosions outside and the darkness out there turns
          into an illuminated garden lit by fountains of fire, sprays of light. The

          acknowledges the congratulations and sycophancy which are her due. Foot-
          men come through the room with trays of ices.
                         
          Anna is still at the window, unaware that there is only darkness outside.

          Karenin remains at apparent ease, as though unaware of people's glances

          The stands and spectators are distant, the first fence coming at him, horses
          on either side. His neighbour falls at the fence but Frou-Frou is clear, with
          Gladiator half a length in front. The next fence is coming up. Gladiator
          and Frou-Frou jump cleanly but a following horse falls badly.

          KARENIN SEES THAT:
                         
          Anna reacts not at all. Her gaze through her glasses stays unwavering
          on Vronsky. Karenin notes this, and from then on his attention is fixed on
          Anna. When the horses come opposite the stand, she lowers her glasses and
          follows Frou-Frou taking the lead from Gladiator.

          Frou-Frou rises, Gladiator rises. Frou-Frou disappears. Gladiator clears
          the fence in Anna's foreground. Simultaneously, there are shrieks and
          exclamations all around her-- OFF CAMERA-- and the view through
          the glasses zigzags in search of Frou-Frou, impeded by horses jumping the
          fence.

           I would. But not for my neighbour's wife.
                         
          Levin is nettled to find that he seems to have made a joke, for the Countess
          especially. Kitty remains serious, watching Levin, loving him.
                         
                          LEVIN (CONT'D)
           An impure love is not love, to me. To admire
           another man's wife is a pleasant thing, but
           sensual desire indulged for its own sake is
           greed, a kind of gluttony, and a misuse of
           something sacred which is given to us so
           that we may choose the one person with
           whom to fulfill our humanness. Otherwise
           we might as well be cattle.

           Ah, an idealist!
                         
          Reconciliatory laughter eases the atmosphere. Levin feels abashed at coming
          out of his shell. He steals a glance at Kitty and finds her looking at him.
          She smiles at him and drops her eyes.

                          KARENIN
           I do not wish to forgive. I am not a cruel
           man. I have never hated anyone. But I hate
           her with all my soul for all the wrong she

          The curtains are drawn closed. The room is dim. Anna sees Serozha sitting
          up, yawning, his eyes closed, and falling back on the pillow. She comes to
          the bed and whispers his name. Serozha raises himself on his elbow, opens
          his eyes and smiles dreamily and falls forward into her arms.

          Serozha rubs his face on her neck, falls back on the pillow, only half awake
          and going back to sleep. Anna looks at him avidly, touching his forearms,
          his shoulders, the hair over his ears. She can't stop her own tears. He comes
          awake.

          Anna, with some dainty shopping by her, is taking tea in a genteel cafe. Her
          eye is caught by a mother and son at another table. The boy is a "Serozha."
          Anna misses her son acutely in that moment.
                         
          Then Dolly enters the tea shop. Anna's heart lifts for a moment and she
          is about to greet her, but then realises that Dolly is one of a trio of "society
          ladies," and Anna lowers her head. When she sneaks a look, she catches
          one of the ladies whispering to the others. Anna realises that she has been
          recognised by a stranger, and is notorious. She "hides" in her purse, finding
          money to leave on the table so that she can escape. A sound makes her look
          up and she sees that Dolly has sat down opposite her.

          She looks at the windows of the other train "going by" . . . seeing the pas-

          brief and is borne away, as her own train goes by, accelerating. The win-

          And then she has the same illusion again-- a "Vronsky" and a "Sorokina"
          glimpsed in the other train and snatched away in the instant.
                         
          Now she stands up and goes to the opposite window, where the windows
          of the other train are flashing by in the (anachronistic) manner of pro-
          jected film-frames, and she sees "Vronskys" and "Sorokinas" flashing by at
          gathering speed. And then the train has gone and there's nothing going by
          but the view.

          Anna steps down from the train. The platform is well populated by people
          waiting to board the train or to meet the arriving passengers. There is an
          energy about the people-- shouting, laughter, movement. Porters shout for
          custom. A couple of Young Men seem to be laughing rudely directly at her,
          but they pass by, ignoring her.
                         
          Anna pauses, bewildered, lost, not knowing what to do next.
                         
          She sees the Sorokina Coachman on the platform, recognising his distinctive

          is a Footman carrying three hatboxes and a large box from a dress shop.
                         
          Anna walks away, along the platform, impeded by people going by her,
          aware that some are staring at her as she passes. A Boy selling drinks grins
          at her. A little group of Ladies and Children meeting a bespectacled man
          off the train are laughing and chattering but fall silent and look at her. She
          increases her pace. She hurries away towards the far end of the platform.
          Beyond her, a goods train is slowly approaching. Between her and the train,
          two Maidservants are walking towards her. They turn their heads to look
          at her, remarking on her dress.

          There is a rough bench near the end of the platform. Anna reaches it and
          sits down. The two girls turn again to look back at her, and are struck
          by the sight of Anna sitting alone in profile. The goods train reaches her
          and the first wagon goes past her. The two girls stop and watch, vaguely
          puzzled by her.
                         
          As they watch, the beautiful woman on the bench gets up and walks the
          few steps to the edge of the wooden platform and into the path of the train,
          disappearing from view between the wheels of one of the wagons.

           chose a wife?

           You're a great one for reasoning, Konstantin
           Dmitrich, but what's rightly is outside your
           mathematic--that's what's rightly about it!
                         
          This stops Levin's scythe. He is illumined.
                         
          Theodore swings the scythe again. Levin walks away, gives his scythe to a
          Labourer by the cart, and keeps walking. He quickens his pace.

          Cries of alarm and laughter burst from a Mushrooming Party approaching
          the house. Children run ahead, the adults walk faster, then run, helping
          with baby carriages and picking up small children and baskets of mush-
          rooms . . . urged on from the porch by Agafia.
                         
          Levin, coming from the hay field, joins the rout.

          and Princess Shcherbatsky.
                         
          The children are: Tanya, Grisha, Masha, Lili and Vasili. Dolly carries
          her youngest. The children are eighteen months older than when we first
          saw them.

           It's all right, the mistress is giving Mitya
           his bath.
                         
          It is evident from her tone that Kitty and Agafia have made it up long ago.

          Rain on the window and on the roof. The rain is so loud that it is the
          foreground sound in the scene; and the dialogue, while we can pick it out
          without difficulty, is the background sound.
                         
          Levin enters, wet.
                         
          Dmitri (Mitya), two months old, is lying on his back in a basin, supported
          by Kitty's palm under his head. Kitty squeezes a sponge over his body,
          which he likes.

          Kitty lifts Mitya onto a towel on her lap, wraps him and gives him to
          Levin, who is enchanted by him.

          Oblonsky comes from inside and lights a cigar. Indistinctly seen and heard
          through the window, the Mushrooming Party occupies the dining room.
          Oblonsky smokes thoughtfully, melancholy.

          Baby Anya, old enough to stagger on her feet, wavers through wild flowers
          half her height. She falls over, almost disappearing.
                         
          This is being watched, with a mixture more pleasure than pain, by Kar-
          enin. He is in early retirement, sitting with a book in a garden seat, dressed
          comfortably under a straw hat. There is the SOUND OVER of people
          playing croquet.
                         
          Serozha, aged ten, enters his view, going to Anya to haul her upright, and
          keeping hold of her hand as she staggers on. Karenin's pleasure increases
          slightly.
                         
          OVER this, the growing SOUND of a battlefield.

          Vronsky, in an unfamiliar uniform, sabre pointing forward, is mounted at
          full gallop with the SOUND of the charge all around him in the smoke and
          noise of guns. Something heavy and invisible with its own SOUND--like
          the flap of an awning--takes him from his horse into the air and gone,
          leaving spouts of blood poised for an instant in the smoke.
