          TITLE SEQUENCE OVER MUSIC
          A series of tight CLOSE-UP shots of dancers moving in high
          energy fast paced sexy choreography. Very provocative. Legs.
          Arms. Butts. Boas. Sequins. Costumes. High heels. A
          kaleidoscope of images and colors.

          END TITLES ON A BLACK SCREEN
          FADE IN sounds of PEOPLE TALKING -- GLASSES CLINKING -- all
          the BACKGROUND SOUNDS of a BUSY, HIP NIGHTCLUB. SUDDENLY.. .a
          loud DRUM ROLL.
          CAMERA is low, moving through BACKSTAGE, passing CURTAINS and
          the WINGS, flying out onto a shiny black STAGE awash in
          light. PUSH IN on FOOTLIGHTS which are now blinding us,
          blasting into camera as they form the word...

                         BURLESQUE
          DRUM ROLL ends with a CYMBAL CRASH. The SCREEN goes BLACK.
          Then we hear an opening MUSIC "INTRO", a bawdy QUARTET.
          EXTREME CLOSE UP: RED LUSCIOUS LIPS... speaking directly into
          CAMERA in a smoky, sultry voice.

                         TESS
          Once upon a time ...a long, looong
          time ago... there was a good little
          girl...and they called her...
          REVEAL ...TESS. A stunner with impossibly long lashes,
          theatrical make-up and a sequined, skin-tight band-aid of a
          dress. She works the tight stage of the club, toying with
          the AUDIENCE.

                         TESS (CONT'D)
          Burlesque.
          MUSIC BLARES from a HOT YOUNG BUMPER BAND -- sax, drums, bass
          -- wearing bowler hats, suspenders and lots of ink. The
          crowd HOOTS. Lame streamers EXPLODE from the stage.

                         TESS (CONT'D)
          Some say she up and died-of

          .old age.
          The club's red booths are about half-full with a hip crowd.
          Walls cluttered with photos. Celebrities tucked in shadows.

          try, you can't keep a good girl
          down. And I've got a bevy of 'em.

          INT. BACKSTAGE DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          A DOZEN gorgeous, leggy GIRLS fight for the mirror. Miles of
          skin. Heavy make-up. Lashes. Boobs. Butts. Fishnets.
          Boas. And SEQUINS. Oceans of them. It's definitely
          decadent. Completely cabaret.

          TESS (O.S.)
          Come to think of it, none of them
          are all that good, which isn't all
          that bad...
          SEAN (31), a cute gay guy with an armful of accessories
          pushes his way through the girls and in a blur, tightens a
          corset, tosses a boa, adjusts a garter just so.

          TESS (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Eight shows a week. Sixteen
          gorgeous girls. Thirty-two towers
          of luscious legs...

          BACK ON TESS --
          Behind her, our GIRLS slink onto the stage one by one.

          Say hello to Scarlett. Jesse.
          Anna. Coco-puff. And Georgie-Girl.
          The girls gather at the edge of the stage, lit by footlights,
          moving in place to the beat of the INTRO MUSIC. Hips sway.
          Fingers snap. Tess weaves playfully between them.

                         TESS (CONT'D)
          All of them the creme-de la creme.

                         (CYMBAL CRASH)
          De la creme.
          The girls strike nasty, (but funny) provocative poses, etc...

          Each one a bastion of bodacious...

          I meant TEASE...
          FOOTLIGHTS FLARE, UPLIGHTING THE GIRLS. They shift their
          weight, hitting the beats with risque moves and hip-thrusts
          as they MOVE DOWNSTAGE suggestively toward the audience to
          the MUSIC...

          EXT. MAIN STREET, GRUNDY, IOWA - NIGHT

          A small, grime-streaked steel town, hanging on by the skin of
          its teeth. Boarded-up storefronts, a run-down A&P. CAMERA
          MOVES past an old sign: WELCOME TO GRUNDY!!! and lands on
          a broken neon sign that reads "DWIG 'S BAR" It flickers so
          you can read the name: DWIGHT'S. Then goes back to DWIG.

          INT. DWIGHT'S BAR - SAME

          Chipped paint. Old beer posters. A few pathetic customers.
          Beer on tap. Pinball standing lonely in the corner.
          A REGULAR drains his beer, tosses down a quarter and starts
          to leave. Someone stops short at the table.

                         ALI
          Uh, excuse me? You forgot
          something.
          He turns. Sees:
          ALI ROSE. One hand holding a bar rag, the other planted on
          her hip. Ali has a look that's all her own: short shorts,
          white platform sandals, hair piled up high, more make-up than
          the rest of Grundy's women combined. She's young -- 22 --
          but has a confidence that's got nothing to do with age.

                         REGULAR
          No, that's your tip.

                         ALI
          Huh. See, now that's interesting --
          you and I must do math completely
          differently, cause me? I start with
          the six beers I brought you, add
          the four spills I cleaned up, the
          five times I refilled your peanuts,
          plus the three times you
          "accidentally" touched my ass, then
          I tack on lying to your wife when
          she called looking for you, twice,
          and I come up with a sum that's a
          hell of a lot more than twenty-five
          cents.
          Before the Regular can respond, Ali is joined by LORETTA --
          30's wearing every one of those years hard.

                         LORETTA
          She's just teasing, Ike. You go on
          home now, and tell Kay I said hi.
          The Regular leaves. Loretta picks up the quarter.

                         LORETTA (CONT'D)
          It's better than nothing.

                         ALI
          Nothin's cheap. A quarter's an
          insult.

                         LORETTA
          It'll cover half a load down at the
          Spanky Clean.

                         ALI
          There's only one thing a quarter is
          good for.
          Ali takes the quarter and heads to the back of the room,
          passing a GEEZER who's sitting by himself, drinking alone.

                         LORETTA
          Oh no, hon, now you know how Dwight
          feels about that.

                         ALI
          Dwight isn't here.
          Ali stops in front of the rinky-dink karaoke machine.

                         LORETTA
          He could come back any minute.

          Tough. I'm not working here for the
          tips Loretta.
          She pops the quarter into the machine and chooses a song.
          She picks up the microphone and, after a few opening beats,
          starts singing ETTA JAMES'S "SOMETHING'S GOT A HOLD ON ME".

                         ALI (CONT'D)

          OOOOOOOOOH, SOMETIMES I GET A GOOD

          FEELING, Y-E-A-H
          And now we see where the confidence comes from. She's got a
          voice that's way too big for this town-- the kind that
          reaches way down inside you and rattles things loose.
          WE HEAR the same song continue as we INTERCUT with:

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - ON STAGE - NIGHT

          The Girls undulate at the footlights as they sing the chorus:

                         WE INTERCUT:
          IN DWIGHT'S BAR, Ali is belting now. Loretta is torn between
          enjoying listening and watching the door for Dwight.

          I GET A FEELING THAT I NEVER,

          People around here wouldn't know
          talent if it bit 'em in the
          Danglies. Where you gotta go is Des
          Moines. They got karaoke bars

          Loretta-- when I get out of this
          butt-hole of a town, I sure as shit
          won't be heading for Des Moines.
          She hops up onto the bar, spins around on her butt, one leg
          up in the air like a Varga girl, then hops down on the other
          side then gets back to work.

          The audience is still applauding as the Performers crowd into

          Weave, wax, paws and claws.
          She drops her bag, quickly peels her clothes off, holds out
          her arms as Sean slips her corset onto her--
          Tess eyes Nikki's body--

          Ali winds her way through the trailers, carrying a bag of
          take-out, with a swing in her step -- moving to music playing

                         ALI
          They were out of steak fries, so I
          got you some of those...
          Then she stops in her tracks. Nanna -- 80's, housecoat,
          oxygen tank -- is slumped in her chair. The TV remote is on
          the floor. "ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT" is blaring.

           Loretta and Ali, at the grave with a MINISTER who looks to be
          about 17. A CEMETERY WORKER is nearby, picking his teeth
          with a toothpick.

                         YOUNG MINISTER
          Dear Lord, we gather here today not
          to mourn, but to celebrate the life
          of Alison Rose.

                         ALI
          Arlene.

          What?

                         ALI
          She's Arlene. I'm Alison.

          Oh, shit.

          Can I start over?
          Ali rolls her eyes.

          LATER,
          The Minister and the Cemetery worker walk away, leaving Ali
          and Loretta alone.

          You were real good to her, Ali.

                         ALI
          No, she was good to me.
          She rearranges the flowers resting on the plot, fixing it up.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          And she wasn't even my real Nanna.

          What...?

                         ALI
          Foster care. She took me in for the
          checks. When I turned eighteen, the
          money stopped coming. She could've
          kicked me out, but she didn't.

          could tell.

          Well, then I guess this is a

          to fit them into the suitcase, but it won't close. She picks

          exciting city. She SPOTS a SHITTY HOTEL with a sign: "$49.00

          pointing out the features of the room, speaking fast in an
          impossibly thick Kurdish accent. Ali nods along, not

          She digs out her cash, sticks it under the mattress. Then

          She removes the money, takes a Ziploc bag full of make-up
          from her purse, dumps the make-up onto the bed, seals the
          money up in the Ziploc, and takes it into:
          THE BATHROOM. She lifts the lid of the back toilet tank and
          slips the Ziploc of cash under it, catching the bag in the
          lid as she sets it back down, so it won't fall in.
          She goes back into the main room to find a CALICO CAT sitting
          on the window sill. It MEOWS, hops into the room.

          A LONG LINE OF 165 GORGEOUS, IMPECCABLY GROOMED GIRLS.
          Ali stops in her tracks. Tougher competition than she was
          expecting. She heads for the back of the line, passing girls
          doing vocal warm-ups. One girl is belting out a riveting
          "SOMEWHERE OVER THE RAINBOW". Just as Ali gets in line, the
          door opens and a SKINNY GUY sticks his head out.

          EXT. SUNSET STRIP - NIGHT

          Ali wanders down the sidewalk chugging an iced latte. The
          Strip hums with SLICK NIGHT LIFE. Expensive cars pull up to
          valets. Hipsters swish past velvet ropes. Ali moves through
          the throngs, alone, anonymous, invisible.
          She passes a CONSTRUCTION SITE for a 15-STORY-TALL BUILDING,
          all lit up, guys working at night. A BUS pulls out, spewing
          exhaust. As the smoke clears, Ali sees, across the street:
          A BEAUTIFUL, STATUESQUE GIRL standing on the landing of a
          fire escape under a street lamp beside a NONDESCRIPT CLUB.
          Ali catches glimpses of her as the Sunset traffic whizzes by:
          full make-up, spangled burlesque costume, impossibly high
          heels, awesome. This is Coco. Coco makes the dirty
          streetlight look like a movie-quality Kleig. Everything about
          her shimmers.
          Intrigued, Ali looks for a break in the traffic and crosses
          the street. As she nears the club, she hears a MAN'S VOICE:

                         ALEXIS
          Like I said, LOOK BUT DON'T TOUCH!
          ALEXIS, drag queen/door whore, also in full costume and make-
          up, TOSSES a GUY out the front door onto the street, then
          heads back inside--
          Ali smiles to herself. Then turns back to look at COCO who
          disappears inside a BACK DOOR as...NIKKI walks out. Lights a
          ciggie. She has on full make-up. Lacquered lips. Lashes like
          peacock feathers. She sees Ali staring.

                         NIKKI
          Didn't your Mama tell you it's not
          polite to stare?

          Nikki strikes a pose, campy, showing Ali her best side. They
          both laugh.

          That you're a dude.
          Nikki's face turns to stone. Her eyes widen in horror. Ali
          sees the mistake she made. She's mortified.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          Oh, shit.

          Sean grabs her and drags her inside. As he does, a STRAND OF
          CRYSTAL BEADS comes off her costume, falls to the ground.

                         ALI
          I'm really sor--
          The stage door slams shut. Ali picks up the strand of beads.
          Holds them up in the light, watching them shimmer.
          She goes to the front of club, where a smattering of L.A.
          HIPSTERS enter. There's a GLASS DISPLAY CASE full of photos
          of the acts. Ali looks at the pictures of the Girls in their
          elaborate costumes and provocative poses.
          She's unintentionally made her way to the front door. Black
          curtains obscure her view inside. She peers in. HEARS cool
          music emanating. The sounds of a nightclub. Intriguing. She
          ventures inside...

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT

          Ali MOVES down a DIMLY LIT HALLWAY. More beautiful photos of
          women in elaborate costumes, drawings, sketches, paintings
          clutter the walls. Ali follows the photos down the hallway.
          MUFFLED SOUNDS penetrate the darkness: people talking over
          each other, glasses clinking. 1930's Berlin style music.

          is Natasha the shot girl.

          Twenty bucks.
          Ali looks in her wallet. Sees one lone twenty inside. She
          hands it to Alexis. He nods for her to go ahead. Ali
          descends a staircase INTO THE CLUB...
          .and is BOMBARDED by: colors, chaos, laughter, scandal --
          all shimmering, as if someone dunked the place in glitter.
          And over it all, an incredible mash-up of old music with a
          contemporary beat tying it all together.
          Ali ENTERS, rounds a pillar, staring out into the room as a
          SPOTLIGHT finds the stage where half a dozen OSTRICH FANS

          MUSIC KICKS IN AS LIGHTS FLARE from the back of the stage,
          where Three Girls stand, backs to the audience, Fosse-style.
          Coco, Georgia, and Nikki strut downstage. Behind them, Girls
          MOVE AND DANCE on cabaret chairs. Totally raunchy, completely
          timeless.

          chairs, arched backs, legs reaching upward, bending over,
          asses to the audience, bodies writhing in air-tight
          choreography: thrusting hips, whipping heads, stomping feet.
          Ali watches, exhilarated, as the music builds and SWELLS to a
          full on performance with the entire ensemble--

          I thought you looked familiar.
          He smiles. As Ali sips her free beer, Jack stacks drinks on a
          tray for a DITSY WAITRESS. He slides the tray to her. She
          doesn't notice. He barks at her:

          She switches to mascara. Sean, arms heavy with corsets,
          catches eyes with Ali, nods toward Tess: "that's her." Ali
          steps closer to Tess.

          The Bumper Band plays as Ali makes her way back toward the
          bar, dejected. Across the room, the Ditzy Waitress, holding
          an empty tray, flirts with a table of YOUNG HIPSTER GUYS.
          Ali sees ANOTHER TABLE OF CHIC CLUBSTERS trying to get the
          waitress's attention. The Waitress ignores them.
          Ali sees the trays on the end of the bar. She grabs one, goes
          to the TABLE OF CLUBSTERS, clears their empties, takes their
          order. She finds Jack at the bar, unloads the empties.

          She heads back to the bar with empties, eyes glued to the
          stage, where Coco and the GIRLS are dancing to "Wagon Wheel
          Watusi." As Ali hits the bar, Coco nails a stunning kick.

          cabaret chair, on pointe.
          ON THE FLOOR, Ali delivers a tray of drinks to a table of

          flurry of fierce ballet moves, finishing to APPLAUSE as...

          Backstage mayhem. Girls scurry, Sean fusses, Tess sits at the
          mirror, applying a fake eyelash as WE HEAR a surprisingly
          good woman's voice BELTING a SONG! It's Nikki. Late again.

                         TESS
          Nikki, do you even own a watch? Or
          do you measure time in Patron
          shots?
          Ali enters with a tray of drinks. Nikki swipes one.

          Nikki opens a bottle, pops 3 pills in her mouth, washes them
          down with the drink, and sets the empty glass on Ali's tray.

          You, I guess.
           Nikki turns to the mirror and starts getting to work. As Ali
          hands out the other drinks:

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          Tess? Do you have a second?
          Tess doesn't answer. But a slight glance at Ali in the

          The Girls trade looks, knowing Ali's overstepping here. Ali
          doesn't feel the vibe-shift, surges ahead.

          I've been reading up on it, and
          back when burlesque started, that's
          what they did.
          Silence. Nobody moves. All eyes on Tess.

          Oh, no she didn't?
          Tess slowly spins around in her chair to face Ali. Peers at
          her with a supercilious gaze.

          Vaudeville -- is the word you're
          looking for. Derived from the 15th-
          century French expression "voix de
          ville" -- "voice of the city".
          Popular songs of the time that were
          strung together into stage shows.
          Which, over time, gave birth to
          another kind of show in which
          talented girls showing a bit more
          skin danced, did skits, and, _ yes,
          sang. In addition to being
          raunchier, these shows were
          funnier, hence the new name.
          "Burlesque": "comical" in French.
          Ali sees the Girls enjoying this dressing-down immensely.
          Tess stands, peers down her nose at Ali.

          She sashays out leaving Ali standing there with what's left
          of her dignity and an empty cocktail tray. The Girls launch
          back into prepping for the show.

          Ali pushes in, pissed off, and hears the sound of PUKING.
          She sees Georgia's BOOTS sticking out from under the stall.

          Georgia? You okay in there?
          A FLUSH. The stall door opens. Georgia comes out shakily

          They tear past her. She shakes her head, reaches her
          landing, heads down the hall toward her room, then sees:

          independent.
          She opens the window. The cat scurries back in, leaps onto

          dancers in L.A?

          (to the waiting dancers)
          Last group, please.
          HALF A DOZEN DANCERS move to the stage. Ali watches from
          behind the bar, thinking. Then, on her face, we see: an idea
          forming.
          ON THE FLOOR, Tess and Sean check their clipboards,
          organizing for this next set. They look up and start in:

          All right, ladies, and five, six,
          seven -- whoa.

          Sean's eyebrows reach for the ceiling as Nikki enters, SEES
          Ali on stage.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          I may not have been to a
          professional dance school, but I
          have a lot of talent and I came to
          this town to do something with it.
          And the only reason I've been
          putting up with all the bullshit
          "attitude" I get from you is cause
          I want to do it here.

          you're gonna give me MY shot. Right
          here. Right now.
          Everyone in the club just stands there. Jaws dropped. Tess
          just looks at her, blinks, incredulous.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          One song. You don't like it, I'll

          Tough Lover!
          Tess plops down in a booth-- crosses her arms indignantly.
          ON STAGE, the music starts. Ali readies herself, starts to
          dance. Behind a beat to two. She's got the steps right, but
          it isn't clicking. She's thinking too hard. No personality.
          After a few measures, Tess has seen enough.

                         TESS (CONT'D)
          Okay then, next?

          Start it again, please?
          As Dave resets the music. Ali regroups: takes her hair down
          and shakes it loose.

          Shhhh.
          On stage, Ali takes a beat; inhales, breathing in attitude.
          Then she looks up at the booth again.

                         ALI
          Anytime.
          The MUSIC starts in again. And this time, Ali comes alive.
          She may not have perfect technique or the best extension, but
          she exudes an ambition and sexuality no one has seen from her
          before. It's like she becomes a woman before our eyes. She
          misses a step or two, but who the hell cares?
          On the floor, Sean gapes, eyes popping. Tess is poker-faced.
          Coco and Georgia's expressions turn from dubious to
          respectful. Nikki's eyes narrow.
          At the bar, Jack freezes, a huge rack of glasses in his arms -
          - unable to tear his eyes away.

          her ass, then lands in a sexy layout on a chair, owning the
          stage. The music ends. A stunned silence. The only sound
          is Ali's heavy breathing.
          Then Georgia jumps up, APPLAUDING EFFUSIVELY.

                         NIKKI
          What are so you happy about, that's
          your replacement.

          Yeah, but she's really good.
          Tess and Ali are in a stare down.

                         TESS
          I want so badly to say something
          bitchy, but nothing's coming.

                         SEAN
          There's a first.
          Tess sighs, not wanting to give Ali any props.

                         TESS
          You were off the whole second half.

                         ALI
          So, I was spot on the first half?
          Tess narrows her eyes at Ali. Then looks over at Nikki, Coco
          and Georgia. Georgia gives an effusive THUMBS UP-- then
          suddenly becomes overcome by nausea, covers her mouth and
          RUNS to the bathroom to puke--
          Tess rolls her eyes, looks back at Ali.

                         TESS
          Oh, you're gonna be such a pain in

          Sean jumps up on the stage.

          The last face to turn is ALI'S. In FULL STAGE MAKE-UP, she
          looks like a gorgeous classic burlesque dancer. The girls,
          in 20's revealing bathing suits and stilettos, kick and dance
          downstage in a line. Ali struggles a little to keep up

          She NAILS a final layout on a chair, it's flawless.
          Tess and Sean are watching from the wings. They notice the

          washes off her make-up, humming "Rich Man's Frug" to herself.
          She heads back out to the dressing room to find:
          EVERYONE IS GONE. She looks around. Feels like an fool.

          Ali scoops the cat up.

          Awwww. Poor guy, you must have been
          desperate.

          His cell phone rings. As he checks who's calling:

          Natalie.

          Ali, in pajamas, is at the table, combing the classified

          Truth is, you should get a car

          jumps in, seamless, as the guys on Bass and Drums join in.
          Ali picks up the choreography. The girls fall in with her.

          TOUGH LOVER. YEAH-YEAH. TOUGH

          LOVER. UH-HA...
          Coco and Scarlett chime in on back-up. Hearing them, Jessie
          and Anna join in as well. Ali takes off, holding nothing
          back. The girls feed off her confidence, and soon all of
          them are hitting the backs of their cabaret chairs, stomping
          their feet to the music. The girls singing back-up.
          In his seat, Marcus sits up a little straighter -- suddenly
          paying more attention. Unable to take his eyes off Ali.
          The BAND plays along. The BARTENDERS accompany them with
          hand-claps. All except Jack, who's too spellbound to move.

          ON THE FLOOR, Nikki watches, aghast, as the crowd engages
          like we've never seen them.

          The room ERUPTS IN APPLAUSE, knowing they caught a once-in-a-
          lifetime performance. Marcus stands, clapping, whistling.
          Ali basks in it, jubilant, rapturous. She glances to the
          wings and sees Sean, clapping and jumping in place. Then she
          sees Tess beside him, stone-faced.

          The Girls exit the stage in a flurry, everyone congratulating
          Ali -- a whirlwind of hugs, kisses. Ali reaches Tess.

          Tess, when the music stopped--

          Good.
          The Girls file into the dressing room. Tess heads out, past

          She leaves. Nikki scowls. Sean grabs Ali.

          Bitch, you SANG that damn song!
          He heads off to the dressing room, too, leaving Nikki and Ali
          alone together. Their eyes meet.

           Ali trots out from backstage, spots Jack behind the bar. She

          Where'd you learn to sing like
          that?

          I just got into the show and

          Shrugs, "but, you are" then--

          How about a drink?

          Sure. Jack's at the bar. Tell him I

                         MARCUS
          But I hate lines.
          AT THE BAR - Jack looks up, SEES Ali and Marcus talking.
          BACK ON MARCUS who looks Ali up and down.

                         MARCUS (CONT'D)
          Seriously. You sound even better

          Talk about a "line."
          She smiles, amused, and heads away from him, toward the bar.
          He watches her go. Tess intercepts Ali.

          What did he want?

                         ALI

          After hours. The club is closed. Jack, Ali, Coco, Sean and
          Georgia are sitting around the bar as Jack closes up.

          something starts to move inside me.

          and it just builds and builds

          Trust me, I know what that feels

          She hops off the stool and scurries to the back. Coco
          stands, to leave. Looks at Ali.

          Wanna grab something to eat?

          Yeah. Lemme get my bag.
          Ali moves off. Coco goes to get her coat. Sean sees Jack
          still watching Ali as she walks across the room.

          All I'm saying is, this one's
          beautiful on the inside too. And
          she won't be on the shelf forever.
          Ali comes back, ready to go. Feels them stop talking and
          look at her.

          I was just explaining to Jack that
          even opportunity has a shelf life.
          Jack grabs a trash bag and takes it out back. Sean looks at
          Ali more closely. He brushes her hair out of her face. Then
          he holds it off her shoulders and raises that gay eyebrow.
          - INT. SALON - DAY - Ali sits in front of a mirror while Sean
          gives the HAIRDRESSER very specific instructions.
          - INT. JACK'S APARTMENT, AT HIS KEYBOARD, Jack plays a high-
          energy style piano which runs over a QUICK SEQUENCE: It's the

          - INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - The Burlesque Girls dance on stage,
          performing a high-energy tap dance, coupled with a European
          slap-dance, with the slapping of each other's bodies and
          faces integrated with tapping and music. It's very cabaret,
          but modernized with contemporary STEPPING. CARRY MUSIC:
          - INT. SALON - LATER - The HAIRDRESSER spins the chair
          around. Ali's her hair is platinum blonde, with bangs and a
          Louise Brooks bob that frames her face beautifully. Her
          smoky eyes pop like never before. Ali studies herself:

          Vince, if I were going to sell, I'd
          have sold to those idiots building
          that monstrosity across the street.
          I said no.

          Which made Marcus bump his offer up
          again. It's obscene, what he wants
          to give us. At least hear him out.

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - TESS'S CLUTTERED OFFICE - NIGHT

          Tess, at her desk, reads a contract. Marcus and Vince sit
          across from her, watching.

                         MARCUS
          It's very simple. I buy you out
          and pay you a million off the top.
          (motions to Vince)
          Five hundred grand each.
          Tess looks up from the contract, squints at Marcus.

                         TESS
          Why do you want this club so badly?

                         MARCUS
          Best view on the Sunset Strip.

                         VINCE
          Do you know what you could do with
          that money, Tess?

                         TESS
          Do you know what you can do with
          that money, Vince?

                         VINCE
          Be reasonable. We're rolling
          vendors ninety days out.

                         MARCUS
          The club's not even worth what you
          paid for it. You've got a second
          mortgage, you can't get a third.
          Tess looks at Vince, betrayed.

                         TESS
          Did you also tell him about the
          tattoo on my ass?

                         VINCE
          It's business, Tess. Not personal.

          My business. Which I built from
          the ground up.

                         MARCUS
          You're not gonna get another
          opportunity like this.

                         TESS
          Exactly.
          She looks at a photo on her wall: the Burlesque Girls, in all
          their glory.

                         TESS (CONT'D)
          Which is why I'll never let it go.
          She gets up, opens the door, ushering them out. Marcus
          shoots Vince an angry look as they head downstairs.
          IN THE STAIRWELL, Vince reassures Marcus:

                         VINCE
          Don't worry. The balloon payment's
          due on the first. She doesn't have
          the money. She has to sell.
          IN TESS'S OFFICE, Tess stands in the doorway, having heard.
          Then she walks back to her desk and sits, dejected. Head in
          her hands. For the first time ever, looking worried and
          defeated. Something she'd never show anyone. A beat. Then:

                         SEAN
          Well. We've had a pretty good run.
          She looks up. Sean is in the doorway.

                         SEAN (CONT'D)
          Maybe it's time to just.. .hang it
          up. Let it go. Call it a day.
          Tess's eyes go steely with determination.

                         TESS
          No. You cannot say that to me. I
          can eat these "sky is falling"
          dipshits for breakfast, lunch, and
          dinner, but not YOU. You cannot be
          that person. I've scoured dirty
          flea markets for costumes, stayed
          up all night sewing till my fingers
          bled, painted and repainted every
          goddamn wall of this place myself.

          I choreographed every step of every
          number. I've played nursemaid,
          sister, mother and shrink to every
          girl who's ever danced here. I've
          hocked every keepsake I've ever
          owned to keep this place afloat.
          Because this club is the last of
          it's kind, and if it goes away, one
          day there won't be anything like it-
          - and THAT would be a tragedy. So
          you cannot say that to me. Because
          now someone's gotta believe in me,
          Goddamnit. And I need that person
          to be you. So don't you ever let me
          hear you say that again. I will
          never let this club go. Never.
          Sean looks at her...a wry smile.

                         SEAN
          There she is. Thought I'd lost you
          for a minute.
          Tess just looks at him, and smiles. He grabs a boa, throws it
          around his neck and exits. When he's gone, Tess's smile
          fades.
          IN THE CLUB, the place is empty. Jack is wiping down the bar
          cleaning up. He starts stacking some chairs in the house
          as..SEAN CROSSES the floor.

                         SEAN (CONT'D)
          Night, Jack.

                         JACK
          Night.
          Sean EXITS as Jack carries a stack of chairs to the side of
          the room, sets them down near the piano. STOPS, grabs a chair
          for himself and sits down. Begins to play an original song.
          ACROSS THE ROOM, Ali ENTERS from backstage. Her dance bag
          over her shoulder. She HEARS the piano, peers around a
          column, SEES Jack playing. She stays in the shadows and
          watches as he sings and plays a beautiful song. (TBD)
          The song ends. Ali applauds slowly. Impressed. Jack looks up,
          surprised that she is there.

                         ALI
          Beautiful. You write that?

                         JACK

          She smiles at his modesty. Nods. He crosses to her. Grabs her
          dance bag and they EXIT together.

          INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON

          Jack enters, unloading his keyboard from his back. He hears
          Ali in the bedroom. He quietly moves over to the ajar
          bedroom door -- peeks in and sees:
          ALI, in bra and undies. She hums the song he played the night
          before in the mirror as she gets dressed.
          ON JACK, watching, mesmerized. His eyes travel her body.
          She moves out of view. He leans against the wall to try to
          keep seeing her -- and steps on the CAT. It MEOWS. He
          flattens against the wall. Ali looks up.

                         ALI
          Jack?
          Jack zips back to the door, opens it quietly, then SLAMS it.

                         JACK
          Hey! Just got home!
          Ali grabs a dress from her bed, slips into it.

                         ALI
          In here! Can you zip me up?
          In a nanosecond-- Jack enters the bedroom.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          Hey. Where you been?

                         JACK
          Rehearsing. I'm playing a late
          show tonight.
          As he zips up the back of her dress, he sees the PHOTO
          propped against the lamp on the bedside table.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Who is that?
          She picks up the picture. Looks at it.

                         ALI
          Me and my mom on my 7th birthday.
          She died just a few weeks later.

          She was so young.

                         ALI
          24. There was so much she never
          got to do. Sometimes I feel like,
          if I make the most of my life, part
          of her will get to live a little
          more, too.

                         JACK
          Wow. You must miss her.
          She puts the photo down. Turns back to him. They're close.

                         ALI
          Every single day, something happens
          I want to tell her about.

                         JACK
          What was today's?
          A beat. Their eyes connect.

                         ALI
          Don't know. Hasn't happened yet.
          They stand there, close to each other. Jack sees a strand of
          hair caught in the earring. He pulls it away, freeing it.
          His fingers move through her hair. She closes her eyes,
          feeling his fingers against her neck.
          Then she opens her eyes, looks at him. He looks back, unable
          to look away. Until:
          His CELL PHONE RINGS. Breaking the mood. He pulls it from
          his pocket. Checks who's calling. Looks back at Ali.

                         JACK
          I should... it's... Natalie.
          Ali steps away from him, disappointed. He answers the phone.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Hey, babe, how are you?
          Ali watches him walk away from her, falling into the
          conversation with Natalie.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Yes, she's still here-What do you
          want me to do, it's not like you're

          FULL CLOSE UP: ALI steps into frame, starts singing.

          THE SONG CONTINUES OVER:
          - INT. JACK'S LIVING ROOM - Ali lies on her stomach on the
          floor perusing a Fashion Magazine. Across the room, Jack sits
          on the couch, PLAYING HIS KEYBOARD--UNDERSCORING THE SONG. He
          looks at Ali. Watching her. Without looking up, she takes a
          pencil, gathers her hair, and puts it up expertly. A few
          strands fall back onto her neck. Sexy. Ali feels his stare.
          Looks up at him. Smiles. He smiles back. She goes back to her
          magazine. ON JACK. Loving that she's there.
          - INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - DRESSING ROOM - Ali, the Girls and
           Sean getting ready. Georgia bursts into the room, showing off
           an ENGAGEMENT RING. Everyone jumps up, congratulates her.

          - EXT. STREET. AFTERNOON - Ali on the back of Jack's
          motorcycle, puts her arms around his waist. Jack revs the
          engine. Weaving through traffic on the Strip. The wind in
          their hair. Her scarf tears away, lifting into the air...

          enter with a birthday cake. They set it in front of Ali.
          Ali looks around at her friends, drinking it in. She locks

          Marcus pulls Ali in the opposite direction, avoiding another

          He starts up some steps to an outdoor gazebo. Ali follows.
          They pass AN INCREDIBLY WELL-DRESSED COUPLE coming down.

          They exchange hellos. Ali notices:

          Ali stares at Marcus. He smiles, takes her hand, keeps
          leading her up the stairs.

                         AL I

          You'd like those guys. Greg's the
          entertainment editor at the Times,
          and Marla's a designer.
          Ali glances back at Marla again, locks in on her shoes.

          He laughs as they reach the top of the stairs and a
          BREATHTAKING PANORAMIC VIEW OF THE ENTIRE CITY is revealed.
          Ali pauses, taking in the glittering, massive view of L.A.

                          ALI (CONT'D)
          Whoa. L.A. looks one hell of a lot
          prettier from up here.

          It should. That view cost me three
          times what the house did.

          Air rights. The guy who owns the
          strip mall was having money issues
          and almost had to sell. Whoever he
          sold to would have put in a huge
          tower. So I bought the air rights.
          Now no one can ever build above one
          story.

          Because you're talented enough to
          get whatever you want. And I'm
          smart enough to help make it
          happen. So? What do you want?
          A beat. She thinks about it. Looks him in the eye.

                         ALI
          I want to be the best singer I can
          be. I want to give as much joy as I
          get when I perform. And I want to
          die knowing I made the most of

          empty house, passes a COUPLE making out on a couch, a GUY who
          holds out a joint. She motions "no thanks", heads into the:
          LIVING ROOM, where Marcus is asleep on a Bertolli chair,
          drink in hand. An OLDER GUY is playing the piano quietly.
          Ali takes the drink from Marcus's hand, sets it on the table.
          She hears the pianist start a new song: (TBD). She smiles.
          Goes over to him.

          Ooh, I love this song.
          The Piano Player scoots to make room. She sits beside him. He
          starts humming along. She does too. Then he sings a line.
          She sings one back. And they fall in together. Not vamping,
          not performing. Just feeling the beauty of the music in the
          middle of the night.

          pauses, noticing:
          Mark, looking up at Sean's apartment, hesitating. Then he
          opens his car to get in. Sean stands there, realizing he's
          doing the same thing. He steps onto the stairwell. Calls out:

          a bottle of wine. Crosses and sits next to her on the chaise.
          Marcus refills their wine glasses. An empty bottle already
          there. She sips as she leans back and relaxes.

          Jack, alone now, collects the clothes Ali left behind. He
          reaches under the couch and sees the PHOTO of Ali and her
          mother. He picks it up, smooths out the cracks. Traces 7-
          year-old Ali's face with his fingertips.

          INT. MARCUS'S HOUSE - GUEST HOUSE - DAY

          Ali lies in a tangle of 1000-thread-count sheets. Her eyes
          blink open. She sits up alone, getting her bearings.

                         ALI
          Where am I?
          She sees a Warhol-esque PRINT OF MARCUS on the wall. She
          raises her brows then sees her disheveled reflection in a
          huge mirror: smeared mascara, hair askew.

          Ali, freshly showered, enters, a stranger in a strange land.
          STAFF is milling around. She HEARS a SPLASH. Looks out the
          glass windows, sees Marcus swimming laps. The HOUSEKEEPER
          passes her, nods "morning". Ali smiles.
          Then she notices a long table full of miniature MODELS of
          BUILDINGS. She takes them in, pausing at a tall, sleek MODEL
          of a glass HIGH-RISE, towering over the other models.
           She runs her finger lightly over it, intrigued. Then she
          sees the address marker: 7800 Sunset Blvd.
          Ali stares, stunned. Marcus enters, toweling himself dry.

          grows up, it'll be a mixed-use
          space: retail and residential.

          This is the address of the

          As Eva performs and the Bartenders and Jack sing, SEAN looks
          up at Dave, and MOTIONS for the SPOTLIGHT on Jack. Dave nods,
          and SWINGS the SPOTLIGHT hitting JACK. The Bartenders push
          Jack up onto the bar as he TAKES THE LEAD--

          A PLUMP WOMAN in front of him looks at Ali. Ali points to
          Jack. The woman taps Jack and points. He looks to see:
           ALI, on the other side of Security. Jack takes his earphones
           off and smiles. He crosses over to her, carrying his bag.
          They are separated by several feet of security ropes.

          flies open and Ali and Tess stride in, an overwrought
          assistant on their heels.

          Assistant scurries out. Businessman turns to Tess.

          Back with more noise complaints?

                         TESS
          You offered to buy my club a few
          years back. I said no.

          Not exactly.
          Tess smiles at him. Looks at Ali, who's not smiling. She
          elbows her. Ali starts smiling. Tess walks up to the desk and
          sits herself down. Ali does the same.

          mutual respect.
          All the other girls begin to pour into the dressing room.
          Chatting, gossiping, changing their clothes. The legs, boobs,

          they'll always be.
          ON ALI. She looks at herself in the mirror. Picks up the make-

          amazing operatic voice that totally blows us away. Then ...a
