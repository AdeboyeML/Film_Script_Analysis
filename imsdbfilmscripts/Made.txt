                                             "Made" -- by Jon Favreau                                                            MADE               INT. SPORTSMAN'S LODGE - SAN FERNANDO VALLEY - DAY               A large crowd has gathered to watch two WHITE BOXERS square               off in a temporary ring in the center of a converted banquet               hall. One is BOBBY, the other is RICKY. They are drawn               together to start the bout by a bell and a hand gesture as               the REFEREE backs away. Immediately the two fighters unload               a relentless barrage of POWER PUNCHES. Neither man is               holding back, and the punches all find purchase in the               swelling faces of their opponent. The crowd rises to its               feet in appreciation of this rare level of competition in               the lower strata of the heavyweight division.                                                                    CUT TO:               EXT. BOBBY'S CAR - COLDWATER CANYON - LOS ANGELES - SUNSET               Bobby drives Ricky home through the winding twists of LA's               landmark canyon. Both their faces are swollen, verging on               the grotesque. Bobby drives a black Special Edition 1979               Trans Am with the gold Firebird stenciled across the hood.               The car is not in great shape, but in its day ruled the               road. A Hawaiian mini warrior mask hangs from the rear view.               The T-top is out, and Ricky struggles to light his               cigarette in the wind. He finally ignites the whole book of               matches in frustration, lights up, then tosses it out.               It lands, still flaming, at the base of a 'No Smoking in               the Canyon' sign. They drive down the palm tree lined               stretch of road bordering Beverly Hills. They turn East on               Sunset Boulevard. The Strip lights are first flickering to               life.               EXT. RICKY'S APARTMENT - YUCCA CORRIDOR - NIGHT               The opening SCORE dies away as Ricky sits beside Bobby. The               neighborhood is awful. The light of the corner liquor store               and a menthol cigarette billboard make up for the broken               street lamps. Ricky smooths out his running suit and steals               an instinctive cautionary look, scanning all the blind spots               for predators. The swelling has now truly set in. He's a               mess.                                     RICKY                         Did Max mention anything about any                         jobs?                                     BOBBY                         What about boxing?                                     RICKY                         What about it?                                     BOBBY                         What are you saying?                                     RICKY                         You said if you didn't have a                         winning record after eleven fights,                         you'd talk to Max.                                     BOBBY                         So?                                     RICKY                         So, it was a draw.                                     BOBBY                         Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1.                                     RICKY                         So, it's not a winning record.                                     BOBBY                         It's not losing record.                                     RICKY                         That's not what you said. You said                         if you didn't have a winning record-                                     BOBBY                         Don't be shitty.                                     RICKY                         How am I being shitty?                                     BOBBY                         Don't be shitty.                                     RICKY                         I wouldn't keep bugging you, but                         you said he said he would have a job                         for us.                                     BOBBY                         I'm not gonna bring it up to him.                                     RICKY                         Of course I don't want you to bring                         it up to him... But if it comes up...                                     BOBBY                         I'll page you.                                     RICKY                         Yeah. Page me. You know the number?

RICKY                         Cause if you don't know the number,                         I can page you with the number so                         you'll have the number.                                     BOBBY                         I know the number.                                     RICKY                         I'll page you with the number. I'll                         see you later. What time you done?                                     BOBBY                         I got no idea.                                     RICKY                         Ask if he said anything to her.                                     BOBBY                         I will.                                     RICKY                         I'll page you with the number.                                     BOBBY                         Bye.               He drives off. Ricky checks his pager, still furtively               scanning the street.               EXT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - BLACKBURN - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT               Bobby pulls up in front of the quaint Spanish Colonial               two-flat. He bounds up the stairs to the upper unit.               INT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS               He lets himself in, searching for his girlfriend. The               apartment is Z-Gallery, with a few accents of Bobby's               HAWAIIANA.                                     BOBBY                         Honey?                                     JESS (O.S.) (O.S.)                         Where were you?               He finds her in the bedroom. JESSICA is a knockout. Too               pretty. The pretty that makes a woman a full-time job.               What's worse is she's decked out like a whore. She's wearing               slutty lingerie covered by a bland terry cloth bathrobe. Her               ridiculously long legs are garnished with candy-apple porn               star sky high heels.  Bobby watches with cultivated patience               as she applies tasteless amounts of make-up from a Mac case               the size of a tackle box. She's in a hurry.                                     BOBBY                              (swallowing utter                              contempt)                         So, what kind of gig is this?

BOBBY                         No. What kind of bachelor party?                                     JESS                         The easy kind. They're young and                         rich and well mannered.               She turns to look at him and reacts to his horrifying               appearance.                                     JESS (continues) (CONT'D)                         Oh my god. What happened?                                     BOBBY                         A draw. What makes you think                         they're well mannered?                                     JESS                         Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a                         bunch of young agents and it's at a                         restaurant. It's gonna be easy and                         we'll make a lot of money.                                     BOBBY                         I don't like you working with                         Wendy. Why are you working with                         Wendy?                                     JESS                         They requested her. It was her gig.                         Max put me on as a favor.                                     BOBBY                         Some favor. I hope they know you're                         not like Wendy.                                     JESS                         Oh, please.                                     BOBBY                         If they asked for her, they're                         probably expecting blowjobs all                         around.                                     JESS                         Will you cut it out! Get ready,                         we're already late.

These are classy                         customers. You can't show up all                         fucked up with a Fila running suit                         on.                                     BOBBY                         They're not too classy to have tits                         rubbed in their face.               She rises and swaps her robe for a floor length overcoat.               God, is she hot.                                     JESS                         Stop. I love you.               She leans in for a kiss. He lets his anger melt. He leans               in to kiss her. She gives him last minute cheek to save the               perfection of her sparkling twenty minute lips.                                     JESS (continues) (CONT'D)                         Let's go.               He follows, slightly slighted.               EXT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - BLACKBURN - LOS ANGELES               As the couple hurries down the stairs, The face of a SMALL               GIRL peeks out the first floor window. This is CHLOE, Jess'               daughter. Her age is somewhere between Paper Moon and Jerry               Maguire. She watches without expression as her mom leaves               for work.               EXT. HAVANA ROOM - BEVERLY HILLS - NIGHT               They valet the car and approach the members only cigar               lounge. Bobby opens the door for her.               INT.

Jess               adjusts her bosom. Bobby continues to percolate. His pager               goes off. He recognizes the number.                                     BOBBY                         You talk to Max today?                                     JESS                         I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.

The elevator door opens, and a room full of horny young               AGENTS and EXECUTIVES see Jessica and cheer. She smiles and               drops her coat. The crowd can't believe their luck when they               see how hot she is. Bobby's heart sinks. He picks up her               coat and walks to the bar as the men wave bills at the love               of his life.               INT. BAR - HAVANA ROOM - UPSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS               Bobby settles into a bar stool, watching the action from a               distance. WENDY, a slutty Pam Anderson pre-tit-removal               wannabe, is already bouncing her ass ghetto-style in a young               agent's face. The crowd gravitates to the new meat like a               pack of ravenous dingoes. A beautiful young BARTENDER with               her hair tied back drops a cocktail napkin in front of               Bobby. She sees his bruises.                                     BARTENDER                         Did you get the license plate of                         the truck?                                     BOBBY                              (unamused and                              preoccupied)                         Johnny Red rocks.               A BLACK MAN in his late twenties slithers up beside him.               His name is HORRACE and he seems to like gold. He puts down               his empty highball glass.                                     HORRACE                         Martel's and coke. One ice cube.

You ain't got no                         snifters in this motherfucker?                                     BARTENDER                         We have snifters                                     HORRACE                         Then put my Martel's in a snifter.               She walks away to get him his snifter.                                     HORRACE (continues) (CONT'D)                         Like I'm gonna break her goddamn                         snifter.               Bobby downs his drink as he watches Jess give a HORNY GUY               in a suit a lap dance. He gets a little frisky, grabbing her               ass cheeks. Bobby begins to RISE. Jess circumvents any               confrontation by smiling and twisting away his wrists. She               throws Bobby the 'Don't worry, I got it' look. He sits.               Horrace pokes his nugget encrusted fingers into his sock,               counting a stack of bills.                                     HORRACE (continues) (CONT'D)                         It's already been a hell of a                         night. Where you been?                                     BOBBY                         I had a fight up at Sportsman's.                                     HORRACE                         Well, you look it. You win?

BOBBY                         Yeah, sure.                                     HORRACE                         I'm serious. Humping sheetrock and                         driving on weekends got to get to                         you after a while. Might be nice to                         buy your lady something. All it                         takes is one fight.               Wendy is now being dry humped by two guys. Jessica looks               over at her, and is concerned. Lines of protocol are               definitely being crossed. Jess' horny guy makes a bold move,               jamming his face in her cleavage.  In a split second, Bobby               has crossed the room and has him by a wrist. The guy is               surprised by Bobby's presence and grotesque appearance.                                     HORNY GUY                         Whu-                                     BOBBY                         There's no touching.                                     HORNY GUY                         But what about them?                                     BOBBY                         I don't give a shit. I work for                         her. No touching.               She hands Bobby a stack of sweaty bills. He walks away,               zipping the roll into his pocket. When he arrives at the               bar, a drunk EXECUTIVE is having a quiet conversation with               Horrace. Horrace looks around, answers, and the executive               picks quite a few hundreds out of his wallet. Horrace walks               him back to Wendy. Bobby grinds his teeth and points to his               empty glass. The bartender pours and watches the interaction               as Wendy walks off with the executive. The party howls as               they leave the room for some privacy.                                     BARTENDER                              (sarcastic)                         That's not allowed.               Bobby downs another drink. Things are now heating up for               Jess as mob mentality takes hold. She squirms. We TRACK BACK               with Bobby's face as he bee lines for the feisty horny guy,               who holds Jess' hips as he grinds her.                                     BOBBY                         I said no touching.                                     HORNY GUY                         Look, man, I'm the bachelor,                         alright? I gave her a hundred bucks                         in tips alone-                                     BOBBY                         Get your hands off of her.                                     HORNY GUY                         Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How                         much for the treatment?                                     BOBBY                         Your dance is over.                                     HORNY GUY                         Come on, dude. The other chick's                         giving my best man a blow job in the                         toilet. I know the drill, I'll wear                         a rubber-               Bobby cracks his face apart with an uppercut. Another guy               rises in protest and is on his ass with a broken nose before               he can speak.                                     JESS                         God damn it...               Bobby drags his girl by the arm to the men's room. He kicks               open the door and grabs Wendy, who is doing coke off a               mirror with her john. He drags the women out. Horrace               disappears. A PARTIER calls to the bartender.                                     PARTIER                         Call the police.               She picks up the phone, but doesn't dial. She hides a               smile. Bobby drags the women down the staircase.               INT. BOBBY'S CAR - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT               Bobby drives, eyes locked on the road. Jess is beside him,               Wendy's in the back.                                     WENDY                         What the fuck was that about?

You don't think Horrace would                         leave your white ass in there to                         hang?                                     JESS                         Alright.

I better call Maxie and                         tell him what happened before he                         hears it on his own.               EXT. JOB SITE - PACIFIC PALISADES - DAY               ESTABLISHING SHOT of the upscale renovation.               INT. JOB SITE - PACIFIC PALISADES - DAY               Bobby is part of a large CREW OF PLASTERERS midway through               an Amalfi Drive renovation. He trowels a thin coat of               plaster on a kitchen wall. Ricky drags his ass as he sweeps               up dust and diamond wire scraps. The two of them are swollen               to hell as they work side by side in the upscale remodel.                                     RICKY                         So I'm like, 'Maybe I'm not on the                         list cause I'm not a fuckin Persian.'                                     BOBBY                         I thought you hate that club.                                     RICKY                         I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.                                     BOBBY                         Then why do you try to get in?                                     RICKY                         Fuck them.                                     BOBBY                              (hears something)                         Shhh...               The DECORATOR walks in with a YOUNG COUPLE and their six               year old KID. The decorator is irritating. The husband is a               shlubby Jew. His wife is a hot shiksa.               The kid looks like he might already be gay. The guys work               diligently and quietly.                                     DECORATOR                         And as you can see, we're a little                         behind in here. We always knew the                         kitchen would be the trouble spot.                                     HUSBAND                         When will it be ready? Are we still                         shooting for Christmas? I really                         want Christmas in the new house.                                     DECORATOR                         We're trying. Unfortunately the                         trades are stacking a bit. But look                         at this Italian plaster job. The                         color skim-coat will go on next.                                     WIFE                         It looks great.               Ricky sneaks some eye contact to the wife. She almost               smiles as he peers at her with his battle scarred face. The               little boy pokes his finger into the wet plaster. Bobby               throws him a look. The kid just stares back like he owns him.                                     DECORATOR                         Did you see the stove yet?                                     HUSBAND                         The Viking was delivered?                                     DECORATOR                         Yes, of course. It's in the garage.               They leave. Bobby repairs the plaster damage.                                     RICKY                         You see that, bro? She wants to                         fuck me.               Ricky's pager goes off.                                     RICKY (continues) (CONT'D)                         You see that? My shit's blowing up.               He looks around and grabs the wall phone and dials.                                     BOBBY                         Come on, man.

(seeing Ricky)                         Get off the fucking phone. Then he                         wants to know why he's still                         sweeping floors. Bobby, you got a                         minute?               Bobby looks concerned. Something's wrong.               EXT. JOB SITE - PACIFIC PALISADES - DAY               Bobby and Arthur stand by a gravel pile outside the huge               remodel. Arthur looks around and they duck into his Suburban.                                     ARTHUR                         Look, Bobby, I don't know what                         happened, and I don't want to know                         what happened, but something's up.                                     BOBBY                         What are you talking about?                                     ARTHUR                         Maxie wants me to replace you on                         the job tomorrow. He wants you to                         come by the office today.                                     BOBBY                         They were grabbing her fucking ass-                                     ARTHUR                         Hey. I don't know, I don't want to                         know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a                         good kid. I got news, though,                         without you here I can't keep on                         your friend. I got enough people                         pretending to sweep.                                     BOBBY                         Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on                         til I see what's happening.                                     ARTHUR                         Good luck.               EXT. MAX'S OFFICE - VAN NUYS - DAY               Bobby parks his car in the off street lot of Max's run-down               industrial complex. Bobby walks past the many businesses               that share the structure in tandem.               MEN working in an auto BODY SHOP go about their business,               but discreetly watch as the unfamiliar man passes. Bobby               carries himself with the proper amount of ambivalence. He               then passes a loading dock, which also has a secretive               stench.               Finally, he arrives at a STEEL DOOR, above which is mounted               a video camera, several generations past its prime.               A steel sign reads simply: 'M and M Contracting'.               Bobby rings the bell and looks up to the surveillance               camera. He is buzzed in.               INT. M AND M CONSTRUCTION OFFICES - VAN NUYS - CONTINUOUS               Bobby walks into an anticlimactically mundane office. The               decor is sixties industrial gray. There is a waiting area               next to a flimsy lucite partition/reception window, behind               which is a desk. Behind the desk is AUDREY, the sixty-plus               receptionist whose hair was recently 'set' and colored by               her beautician. Security seems quite lax.                                     BOBBY                         Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm here to see                         Mr. Reuben.                                     AUDREY                         You're Bobby, right?                                     BOBBY                         Yeah.                                     AUDREY                         Good afternoon, Bobby. I'll let Max                         know you're here.               She fiddles with her phone. Bobby sits at the kidney shaped               coffee table. He thumbs through a copy of Redbook.                                     AUDREY (continues) (CONT'D)                         He'll be a minute, hon. You want                         some coffee?                                     BOBBY                         No thank you.                                     AUDREY                         You sure? I just made it.                                     BOBBY                         No, thank you. I'm good. Thanks.               He calms his nerves by staring at a recipe for Strawberries               Devonshire.                                                                    CUT TO:               INT. MAX'S OFFICE - VAN NUYS - DAY               Bobby walks in. He doesn't seem like he's been there               before. The first thing that hits you is all the               thoroughbred racing shit all over the place.  Brass table               top statues, pictures of jockeys with wreaths,               hand-painted(!) portraits of horses faces. The second thing               you notice is MAX REUBEN. He's an off-the-rack East Coast               Jew.               He's got deep-set eyes and Abe Vigoda brows. He wears a               golf shirt with a little penguin on it, and oversized               reading glasses are perched on his balding head. His nose               was broken in '63. He smiles broadly as Bobby enters. Bobby               forces a relaxed smile.                                     MAX                              (on phone)                         Will ya calm down. Just calm down                         for a minute, Nadeleh. The money                         will be there. How do I know? I just                         know... Yes. Yes, that's exactly                         what I'm saying... You got my word.               He hangs up his rotary phone and looks up to Bobby, who               stands looking at the painting with his ears closed.                                     MAX (continues) (CONT'D)                         You like the ponies?                                     BOBBY                         Sure. Yeah.

MAX                         Smart. Hard as hell to handicap.                         You know what I like? Hai Alai. Fast                         game. You know why I like it?                                     BOBBY                         Why?                                     MAX                         It's fixed. That's the only way to                         win. A sure thing. See that horse.                         The blaze.                                     BOBBY                         This one?                                     MAX                         Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in                         '66. Hired a trainer, stall,                         whatever it was. That horse made me                         over a hundred grand. In 'sixties'                         dollars. You know what that is today?                                     BOBBY                         Pshhh...                                     MAX                         A million. Easy.                                     BOBBY                         She was fast, huh?                                     MAX                         Never won a race. But it got me in                         with the trainer. We'd have a thing,                         I don't remember, some fucking                         thing. The jockey would raise his                         whip, it meant the fix was in, we'd                         all go running. People get greedy.                         First they bet small, they keep                         their mouth shut. Within a month's                         time, everyone and their brother was                         in on it. The odds would drop, I                         mean you could watch the goddamn                         board. It looked like a fuckin                         stopwatch, the odds would drop so                         fast.                                     BOBBY                         That's why they call it the smart                         money.               Maxie laughs a genuine laugh.                                     MAX                         I like you, kid. Why do you gotta                         make it so hard for me to take care                         of you?                                     BOBBY                         Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they                         were out of line.

You                         didn't have to tear up the goddamn                         place. You knocked out a guys teeth.

Your silverback                         horseshit's gonna cost me eight                         grand.                                     BOBBY                         I'll work it off.                                     MAX                         Not driving Jess, you won't.

I just want a big guinea with a                         busted up face to give him a deep                         bench. As a deterrent.                                     BOBBY                         Ruiz knows about this?                                     MAX                         Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's                         not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I                         like a sure thing. Just go and we're                         square on the tooth.                                     BOBBY                         What about Ricky? He'd jump at the                         opportunity.                                     MAX                         Ricky?

MAX                         I don't know the kid, and what                         little I do scares me.

Ricky               looks out of place as he lights a Marlboro and bitches.                                     RICKY                         Why can't we just grab a goddamn                         beer.

She don't even know where the hell                         she is. She'd have more fun at                         Bordner's.                                     BOBBY                         I'm not taking her to a bar.                                     RICKY                         Why not? I grew up in bars. It's                         fun for a kid.               A YOUNG FEMALE SALESPERSON approaches Ricky.                                     SALESPERSON                         Excuse me, there's no smoking in                         the store.                                     RICKY                         Why?

And you can't sit                         at a station without purchasing a                         ceramic.                                     RICKY                         Could you believe this shit? Fine.                         Give me an ashtray.               She brings him an unpainted ceramic ashtray from a display.                                     SALESPERSON                         What color paints would you like?                                     RICKY                         Surprise me.               He SNUFFS the CIGARETTE out in the ashtray in the palm of               her hand. She puts it down and leaves in a huff.

Chloe resumes her task.                                     BOBBY                         Max won't let me drive Jess to                         dance anymore.

BOBBY                         Go finish getting ready. I'll take                         care of dinner.                                     JESS                         Yeah?

Because that's                         how you learn to cook. I watched my                         grandma cook every night. That's how                         I learned. If you can't cook, then                         you gotta go out to eat every night,                         then you spend all your money on                         food. And when you eat in                         restaurants, the cooks scratch their                         ass and touch the food.               There's a knock on the door.                                     JESS (O.S.) (O.S.)                         Could you get that, baby?               He does. It's Horrace. Bobby's surprised.                                     HORRACE                         What's up? Jess ready?                                     BOBBY                         You driving her?                                     HORRACE                         Yeah.                                     BOBBY                         She'll be out in a minute.               Horrace tries to walk in. Bobby stands in the door.                                     BOBBY (continues) (CONT'D)                              (firm)                         She'll be out in a minute.               Jess hurries in, clipping earrings.                                     JESS                         Hiya Ho. Come in. I'll just be a                         minute.               He throws Bobby a look as he slides by.                                     HORRACE                         Some shit smells good in this                         motherfucker.                                     JESS                         Bobby's cooking. He's the best.                         Whip him up something.                                     HORRACE                         Yeah. Whip me up something. I'm                         hungry as a motherfucker.               Jess hurries out, brushing her hair.                                     BOBBY                         Watch your mouth in front of the                         baby.               Bobby joins Jess in the back.               INT.

She crosses to the door, abruptly ending the discussion.               Bobby grabs her.                                     BOBBY                         She needs a family. A dad.

MAX                         This is the last time I speak to                         either of you in person about work                         related matters. All of our                         interactions in the future will be                         social. If you have any questions                         about anything work related, you                         will direct them to Ruiz. He has my                         full confidence.               FADE UP on...               INT. MAX'S OFFICE - VAN NUYS - DAY               Max sits behind his desk as he briefs Bobby and Ricky.               Bobby wears sweats. Ricky wears a suit. Max speaks with a               directness suggesting gravity. He lays down two MANILA               ENVELOPES. The two guys pick them up.                                     MAX                         Everything you need or need to know                         is in these envelopes. Do not-               Ricky starts to tear his envelope open.                                     MAX (continues) (CONT'D)                         open the envelopes until you have                         left this office.               Ricky sheepishly draws a length of scotch tape from Max's               desk set dispenser.               Mid-pull, he becomes self-conscious and asks for permission.                                     RICKY                         Can I borrow a piece of-                                     MAX                         Go ahead. Open the fuckin things.                         You should each find fifteen hundred-               They tear open the envelopes. Ricky's flies apart, sending               a stack of crisp new Franklin HUNDREDS falling from the air               like a New England autumn morning.                                     MAX (continues) (CONT'D)                         dollars in c-notes, a numeric                         pager, a double-A battery, and a                         first class round-trip ticket to JFK.                                     RICKY                         We're going to New York?

RICKY                         And the money. Where do we bring                         the money?

BOBBY                         It's ours.                                     RICKY                         To keep?                                     MAX                         Yes, for expenses and such. Now,                         you'll be contacted on your pager as                         to where you should go. You each                         have been given an extra battery, so                         there is absolutely no excuse as to                         why a page would not be immediately                         returned. Am I making myself                         abundantly clear?                                     BOBBY                         Yeah.                                     RICKY                         Yeah.                                     MAX                         You will not carry any other pagers                         with you. You will not carry                         anything, for that matter, that I                         have not just given you.                                     RICKY                         Keys.                                     MAX                         What?                                     RICKY                         What about my keys?                                     MAX                         You can carry your keys. You will                         not mention my name or imply that                         you are in my employ. You will not                         speak to anyone while you are                         working. When you are not working,                         you are considered to be 'on call'                         and available twenty-four hours a                         day. This means you will not get                         drunk or do anything that will                         prevent you from operating in a                         professional manner. There is                         already a number in your pager's                         memory. It is a car service. When                         they ask you what account, you will                         respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will                         pick you up and take you anywhere                         you need to go. In other words,                         there is no reason why you should                         not reach any destination that you                         will be called upon to reach within                         fifteen minutes. Do you see a                         pattern forming?                                     RICKY                         Yes.

RICKY                         I get it.                                     MAX                         Tell me.                                     RICKY                         Don't worry.

Why are you picking on                         me?                                     MAX                         Because you lost my fucking carpet                         cleaning van and I don't like you.

MAX                         Yes. Goodbye.                                     RICKY                         So, wait, what are we dropping off?                                     MAX                         Goodbye.               INT. LAX - DAY               One of those cool over cranked tracking shots of the two               guys walking purposefully that means we're really getting               down to business now. A cool song is playing. Ricky and               Bobby each hold a manila envelope.               INT. SECURITY CHECK - LAX - DAY               Bobby lays his envelope on the x-ray conveyor belt. He               walks through the metal detector. He passes the check.               Ricky does the same. The ALARM goes off. Bobby looks               concerned. Ricky pulls a ring of KEYS and drops it in the               tray with a look to Bobby. Bobby looks relieved. Ricky is               dressed to the nines: Dark blazer over a dark sweater.               Bobby, more casual, wears dark slacks, a dark shirt and a               gold horn around his neck.               INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN - UNITED AIRLINES 777 - DAY               They check their boarding stubs and sit in the plush first               class seats in the almost empty cabin.                                     RICKY                         Holy shit. Can you believe this?                                     BOBBY                         Pretty nice.

BOBBY                         Nah, don't bother-               Ricky rings the service chime. An attractive young FLIGHT               ATTENDANT arrives. She has a tray of champagne and orange               juice.                                     FLIGHT ATTENDANT                              (turning off the                              service light)                         Champagne or orange juice?               Ricky takes a champagne. She smiles and walks away. He               stops mid-gulp and rings the bell again. She turns with a               smile.

Everything's free                         up here.               She smiles. He smiles. She walks away. He rings the bell               again. She returns with a strained smile.

He takes another champagne and she crosses to leave. He               calls after her.

I'm just calling to say I                         love you. I'd leave my number, but                         you know you can't call me here, so                         I'll try you later.

RICKY                         You think Maxie doesn't want us to                         roll hard? Why do you think he gave                         us all this bread? Or the number on                         the pager? We gotta represent him by                         showing some class. The man's got an                         operation. How does it reflect on                         him if we nickel and dime it?               He dials. Bobby hangs up.

Ricky talks a steady stream of bullshit, but the               DOORMAN will have none of it.                                     RICKY                         ... How 'bout Jimmy?

RICKY                         Look, man, I never met Ruiz, okay?

BOBBY                         What the fuck is that supposed-                                     RICKY                         Mean, that's what I heard-                                     BOBBY                         You got something to say-               Bobby grabs him, and is about to start another scrap, when               the distant roar of a fleet of JAPANESE SUPER BIKES draws               near. The pack screams up to the duo.               There are a dozen black men, on Ninjas, and they all wear               black Nazi-style helmets.               The two men freeze, and the bikes settle in around them.               One BIKER pulls up to Bobby.                                     BIKER                         They flew you all the way out here                         to cook me up some fuckin puttanesca?               Bobby recognizes the biker is Horrace, from LA. He is               relieved, but not pleased.                                     RICKY                         You know this guy?                                     BOBBY                         His names Horrace. Horrace, this is                         Ricky Slade.                                     HORRACE                         What's up. You all ready to meet                         Ruiz?                                     BOBBY                         Yeah. Where is he?               Horrace throws him a helmet.                                                                    CUT TO:               EXT. HARLEM STREETS - MANHATTAN - NIGHT               Bobby now rides bitch behind Ho, and Ricky clutches the               back of a buff shirtless BROTHER. The bikes rip down the               uptown streets with a ferocity that scares pedestrians. An               urban drum track rattles the SOUNDTRACK.               EXT. LITTLE ITALY - MANHATTAN - NIGHT               The horde of bikers rumble under a red, white, and green               banner strung from street lamps marking the start of Italian               turf. The businesses are all closed or closing.               Looks are drawn from locals as the outsiders chug by at a               respectful trawl.               EXT. LUNA RESTAURANT - LITTLE ITALY - NIGHT               The pack pulls away leaving only Bobby, Ricky, and Horrace.               Ho leans his Ninja to rest next to a custom Buell               Harley-Davidson cafe racer.               Bobby can't help but stare at the rare piece of machinery.               They enter.               INT. LUNA RESTAURANT - LITTLE ITALY - CONTINUOUS               The restaurant is now closed, but RUIZ sits in a rear booth               on a Nokia. He is a slim, young black man with a tight round               fro. He wears a rolex, but, other than that, nothing flashy.               He's wearing dark Gucci slacks, a black pullover crew-neck               shirt, and a black, red and orange racing leather jacket. He               must have pull here, because 'Between the Sheets' is playing               over the stereo of this bare-bones, Italian eatery.                                     RUIZ                              (on cell)                         Nah, man. Nah. Too risky. I don't                         like it... I want out... It's too                         risky... Listen, man, we made a lot                         of money together on this one, but                         it's over. Shit's gonna come down...                         Well, then, you got my blessing. I'm                         selling my end. This internet shit's                         too volatile. I'll keep my block of                         Microsoft, but I'm taking profits on                         Yahoo and all the portal stocks. The                         bubble's gonna pop, man... Alright,                         peace.               The three men approach Ruiz's table.                                     RUIZ (continues) (CONT'D)                         That's it? This is Maxie's cavalry?                         Who the fuck swole you up like that?               Bobby and Ricky both point to each other.                                     RUIZ (continues) (CONT'D)                         Shit. If that shit don't beat all.

The rope is               three-deep and three DOORMEN coordinate the traffic               patterns. The limo settles in and a HOMELESS MAN opens the               door in hope of a tip. Jimmy steps in his way as Bobby and               Ricky, in tattered clothes, move toward a big white DOORMAN               in an oversized hat. They fight their way past the other               people who are fighting their way past the line.

DOORMAN                         He's not here.               While they're waiting, the actor who played SCREECH on               'Saved By the Bell', now in his twenties, walks by and is               let through the rope with a handshake.

Show me where it says                         Screech on the fucking list.               This altercation is cut short by the arrival of Ruiz and               Horrace. The Red Sea parts as they approach the door.                                     DOORMAN                         What's up, bro?

RUIZ                         Yeah.                                     DOORMAN                         Alright. These two are good.               He opens the rope. Bobby shakes his hand.                                     DOORMAN (continues) (CONT'D)                         Sorry, man, but...                                     BOBBY                         Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.                                     DOORMAN                         Any time, bro.                                     BOBBY                         Thanks.               Ricky walks by and throws him a look like he just stuck it               in.               INT. SPA - 13TH STREET - CONTINUOUS               Bobby and Ricky are lead into the club and past a window               and another set of ropes.               Their hands are stamped several times representing the               highest level of security clearance. They file down a               staircase and into one common area where hip-hop plays and               people dance. Ruiz and Horrace touch hands with an endless               stream of ACQUAINTANCES. They pass a myriad of rooms and               seating areas, then down a narrow corridor where they               encounter yet another DOORMAN who waves them past a CLUMP of               VIP hopefuls. They trot down a short bank of stairs and               into...               INT. VIP AREA - SPA - CONTINUOUS               ... a series of passageways furnished like a French parlor.               Lithe MODELS sit amongst Dreadlocked white boys. After yet               another bar, the crowd vomits into a cavernous bomb shelter.               A pulsing dance floor is surrounded by a series of couches               and coffee tables, representing the private seating areas.               At the far end of the room is an elevated stage with a DJ               and a banner reading 'GRANDMASTER FLASH'. The party is               greeted by a male club PROMOTER. He hugs Ruiz. With the               slightest of nods, the party is lead to the prime table with               a table tent marked 'RESERVED.' They sit down as a beautiful               MODEL/WAITRESS brings two buckets of champagne and fluted               glasses. Bobby and Ricky try to hide how impressed they are               as they look at each other. GIRLS on the dance floor throw               priceless looks toward their table. Ricky raises a glass to               one. Ruiz finally looks at them and leans in. He's spotted               someone.                                     RUIZ                         That's him. Now you all know the                         drill, right?                                     BOBBY                         What drill?                                     RICKY                         We don't know any drill. Nobody                         told us anything.                                     RUIZ                         Maxie told you to keep your mouth                         shut while you're working, right?

And put down the                         champagne.                                     RICKY                         She poured it for-                                     RUIZ                         Far as she knows you're John Gotti.                         Now put the shit down and act like                         you got some ass.               Ruiz gets up and crosses to a BRITISH looking GUY across               the room. They watch.                                     BOBBY                         He making the drop?                                     HORRACE                         Nah, man.

HORRACE                         Ruiz don't like using names on cell                         phones. He refers to him as the Red                         Dragon.                                     BOBBY                         So, when's the drop.                                     HORRACE                         To be honest, man, I don't know                         shit either.

Just                         throw up your screw face and don't                         speak unless spoken to.               They settle in and Ruiz comes back with the WELSHMAN.               They're both laughing.                                     RUIZ                         Here, man, sit down.

This draws GLARES from Ruiz, Ho, and especially Bobby.               After an uncomfortable pause, the Welshman breaks the               tension with laughter.                                     WELSHMAN                         Well, that's news to me. The name's                         Tom.                                     RICKY                         Mmmm-hmm.

Ruiz sneaks a glare.                                                                    CUT TO:               INT. LIMOSINE - IN FRONT OF SPA - 13TH STREET - NIGHT               Ricky and Bobby are being lectured by Ruiz, who sits across               from them next to Horrace.                                     RUIZ                         What the fuck was you told? Don't                         talk, right?                                     RICKY                         Unless spoken to, ain't that right,                         Horrace. Didn't you say that?                                     HORRACE                         Don't drag my ass into this-                                     RICKY                         He spoke to me. You want me to dis                         him?                                     RUIZ                         'Dis?' 'Dis?' You're not in a                         position to 'dis', or 'give props',                         or whatever your Real World sense of                         fucking decorum tells you to do.                         You're nothing. You're wallpaper.                         You're not here to make fucking                         friends. Asking a motherfucker where                         he lives. And who the fuck told you                         'Red Dragon'?.                                     BOBBY                         We get it. We're sorry.                                     RUIZ                         Now that Limey motherfucker's jumpy                         and wants to change shit around on                         me. Maxie's gonna shit a Nokia when                         he hears about... Aw, shit, I better                         call him before he hears.               Ruiz pulls out his cell phone and steps out, slamming the               door.                                     HORRACE                         I'm not saying shit to neither of                         you.                                     RICKY                         Why?

Why am I bad?                                     BOBBY                         How bad is it?                                     HORRACE                         It's bad. Before you even showed                         up, he said you were Maxie's 'token                         goons', and not to be trusted. He                         wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna                         ride shotgun to keep the English                         dude above board. Now he's spooked.                         This shit's snowballing.                                     BOBBY                         When's it going down?

Outside, Ruiz starts his bike. Horrace slides out.                                     HORRACE                         See you later.

Horrace closes the door and starts his bike. They ride off.                                     BOBBY                         You happy?

He opens the door.                                     BOBBY                         Where do you think you're going?

Ricky walks past the line with a handshake. Bobby sits,               staring forward.                                     JIMMY                         Where to?                                                                    CUT TO:               INT.

She doesn't want to talk                         to you... No... I don't have to ask                         her. Let it go, Sean.               Cynthia grabs the phone.                                     CYNTHIA                         Will you leave me alone, already..?                         No, Sean, it's over... I don't                         care.... As a matter of fact, I                         am... Yeah. In his hotel room...                                     BIANCA                              (can't believe she                              said it)                         Holy shit.                                     CYNTHIA                         I'm having fun , Sean. Can you                         handle that..? Yeah. He doesn't                         judge me.                                     RICKY                         I don't wear a white wig, I don't                         carry a gavel.                                     CYNTHIA                         That's a good idea, maybe I will!                                     BIANCA                         Are you alright.               She hangs up.                                     RICKY                         Now you girls wait here. I got a                         special surprise.               The girls are all waiting with Bobby as Ricky leaves the               room. Bobby does not make any attempt to keep the ball               rolling.               Cynthia whispers too loud and drunk.                                     CYNTHIA                         Is he cute?                                     BIANCA                         He's okay.                                     CYNTHIA                         Should I fuck him?                                     BIANCA                         I don't know. Do whatever you want.                                     CYNTHIA                         He's great, right. Is he great?                                     BIANCA                         He's alright.                                     CYNTHIA                              (disappointed)                         I know.                                     BIANCA                              (cheerleader)                         But maybe that's okay. Maybe that's                         just what you need.                                     BOBBY                         Can you excuse me for a minute?               Bobby leaves the room. He finds Ricky in a hotel robe               filling the BATHTUB.                                     BOBBY (continues) (CONT'D)                         What the fuck's going on?                                     RICKY                         Dude, get back out there. You gotta                         help me get them in the hot tub.                              (shouts)                         Hang on girls! Just get out there.                         I'll be right out. You know how I do.                                     BOBBY                         Yeah, I know how you do. I know how                         you do. I've heard your kibbles and                         bits all fucking night. You've been                         shaking your ass like an unemployed                         clown. How the room's a boiling pot                         of sugar water. How you're gonna dip                         a string into it and make rockcandy.                         Who wants to play 'Just the tip?'                         Dancing around like a smacked ass.                         Oh, and that coat check girl you've                         been dragging around as 'insurance'                         doesn't even speak English.                              (leaves)               Ricky checks the water and comes out talking.                                     RICKY                         Okay. We got a lot happening here.                         Here comes the good part... Okay...                                     BIANCA                              (re: robe)                         Somebody's getting comfortable.                                     CYNTHIA                         Where's the surprise?                                     RICKY                         You want your surprise?                                     CYNTHIA                         Yeah. I want it.                                     RICKY                         Well, come on then. It's back here.               Cynthia leaves with Ricky. Bobby is left with Bianca and               the Asian coat check girl. Bianca and he are uncomfortable.               After a long pause...                                     BIANCA                         You mind if I roll a joint?               Ricky sits in the BATHTUB with a glass of champagne.                                     RICKY                         You want to come splash around.                                     CYNTHIA                         I'm just warning you, I can't swim.               Then... Bianca sparks up. She offers to Bobby, who refuses.                                     BIANCA                         I'm not like her, you know. I mean,                         I'm not judging, but I'm more about                         my dogs. Do you have dogs? Are you a                         dog guy?                                                                    CUT TO:               Cynthia lets her towel drop. She dips her toe into the               water. Out of nowhere she begins to wail. Back in the main               room Bobby, Bianca, and the Asian girl react to the               off-screen crying. Cynthia comes rushing out in a bathrobe,               bursting with tears. Ricky follows in a towel.                                     CYNTHIA                         I want to leave right now.                                     RICKY                         I didn't do anything--                                     BOBBY                         What the hell did you do?                                     RICKY                         I swear to God, I didn't do                         anything.                                     BIANCA                         Oh no. What is it this time.                                     CYNTHIA                         We used to take baths together.                                     BIANCA                         Come on. Let's go.               Cynthia calls her boyfriend on the cell phone.                                     CYNTHIA                         Sean? I want you to pick me up... I                         know. I'm sorry too.               They leave.                                     BOBBY                         What the fuck was that about?                                     RICKY                         She was jonesing for me.               They notice the Asian girl still sitting there in the room.               Bobby hands her cab fare and escorts her out.                                     BOBBY                         Here you go, darling. Get home safe.               BEEBEEP... BEEBEEP...Both their pagers go off.                                     BOBBY (continues) (CONT'D)                         Fuck.               He reaches for the phone. Dials.                                     BOBBY (continues) (CONT'D)                         Hi.                              (mouthes to Ricky)                         It's Ruiz.                              (phone)                         Yeah. So the driver knows where to                         go? When? We'll be down in five. No,                         I'll tell him. He's right there. Bye.                                     RICKY                         What's up?                                     BOBBY                         He wants to see us now.                                     RICKY                         Where?                                     BOBBY                         He said it's being arranged. He                         said Jimmy will know.                                     RICKY                         We're getting whacked.                                     BOBBY                         We're not getting whacked.                                     RICKY                         Why else you think he won't tell us                         where the sit down is?                                     BOBBY                         It's not a 'sit down.' He said he's                         telling us the plan.               Ricky is waving around a STEAK KNIFE from a room service               tray, testing the weight and balance.                                     BOBBY (continues) (CONT'D)                         What are you doing.                                     RICKY                         I got a bad feeling, man. I don't                         want to go in naked.                                     BOBBY                         You gonna shank him in the shower?                                     RICKY                         Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz,                         who doesn't even want us here, is                         throwing us to the wolves? As an                         apology? And I don't even know what                         we're dropping off or picking up -                                     BOBBY                         We're getting ahead of ourselves.                         We haven't gotten any sleep. Let's                         just keep our mouthes shut and not                         make any mistakes. Now hurry up and                         get your shit on so we're not late                         and make things worse.                                                                    CUT TO:               INT. LIMOSINE - MANHATTAN - MORNING               Ricky and Bobby look awful. They have bags under their               swollen eyes, gorged stomachs, bruised faces, tattered               clothes, and yolk on their chin. Ricky lights a smoke.                                     BOBBY                         Put that shit out...                                     RICKY                         C'mon, man...                                     BOBBY                         I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.                                     RICKY                              (obliging)                         Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?                                     BOBBY                         Yeah. Where they gonna whack us?               Ricky looks at him without an ounce of humor. Jimmy laughs.                                     JIMMY                         If they're whacking you, they're                         doing it in style.               The limo pulls up to...               EXT. TAVERN ON THE GREEN - CENTRAL PARK - MORNING -               CONTINUOUS               Jimmy lets them out.               INT. TAVERN ON THE GREEN - CENTRAL PARK - MOMENTS LATER               The MAITRE D' leads them past an orgy of a BUFFET.               Everything looks sickening to our bloated drunks. The head               of a whitefish in particular makes an impression on the               boys.               They are lead to a table joining Ruiz and Horrace, who are               both dressed appropriately for a society brunch.                                     RUIZ                         Jesus Christ, where the fuck you                         been all night?

RUIZ                         I didn't tell him shit. He worries                         too much. I love that old Jew, but                         he's gonna kill himself worrying. We                         started this shit, and we're gonna                         finish it.

RUIZ                         Tom, the Welsh dude-                                     RICKY                         The Red Dragon.                                     RUIZ                         Shut it, man. Shut it. Tom is a                         square. He don't but dabble in shit.                         Maxie had me hook up a loan-back                         with him, through an Austrian                         passbook account.                                     RICKY                         So, we're talking money                         laundering...                                     RUIZ                         Will you tell Peter Jennings to                         shut up and fucking listen. The                         shit's as routine as you get. I                         coulda turned it over offshore in a                         week, but Maxie likes to do it all                         his way. Safe. I coulda dropped the                         bag alone. It's only two hundred                         G's. But he sent you all. So I can                         either send you home and tell Maxie,                         or we can flush the toilet one more                         time and hope it all goes down.                                     BOBBY                         Let's do it.                                     RICKY                         I'm your soldier.                                     RUIZ                         Now listen. The gig couldn't be                         simpler. You carry the money to the                         Welshman, he checks it, hands you                         his marker, you're done. The washed                         money goes directly to Maxie. Long                         as you hand off the bag, you're                         tight.

RICKY                         Think about it: You knocked out                         that Jewish kid's tooth, cost him                         eight grand, maybe more. Maybe lost                         his whole line of clientele? He                         knows you're fucking up Jess'                         dancing, and I got a feeling he                         knows I stole his carpet cleaning                         van by the way he looks at me. He                         can't kill us in LA cause that leads                         to too many questions. So he flies                         us out here first class for a 'drop'                         that's turned into whatever?

Ricky is preoccupied by a               projected image on the wall.                                     WELSHMAN                         This is the greatest fucking                         country in the world. I love this                         fucking place.

Ricky reluctantly goes               off to find drugs. Tom smiles and hugs Bobby and Horrace.                                     WELSHMAN                         You guys are the fucking best.  I                         swear, I didn't know about this                         whole thing, but you guys are okay.                                                                    CUT TO:               INT. BATHROOM STALL - CHINA CLUB - LATER - NIGHT               Horrace, Ricky, Tom, and Bobby are all packed like sardines               in the toilet stall. Ricky hands Tom a glassine envelope               full of coke.                                     WELSHMAN                              (slurring)                         God love you...               He opens it with drunken abruptness, sending part of it's               contents onto Bobby's jacket.                                     WELSHMAN (continues) (CONT'D)                         Aw, fuck me. Sorry...               He starts rubbing the spillage from Bobby's lapel onto his               gums. Horrace prevents any more waste by taking the envelope               away.                                     WELSHMAN (continues) (CONT'D)                         Sorry, mates. Now there isn't even                         enough to go around...                                     HORRACE                         Don't worry, man. It's all for you.                                     WELSHMAN                              (touched)                         No, really, mate?                                     HORRACE                         Here...               Horrace positions himself so that the Welshman can sniff               from his hand. The four large men all reposition themselves               in the tiny stall, inevitably stepping on each other and               banging heads.                                     RICKY                         Ow, shit...                                     HORRACE                         Watch it...

OUTSIDE THE STALL, the attendant watches the feet shuffle               as they curse from within. INSIDE, Tom snorts a pile of               cocaine from Horrace's outstretched hand.                                     WELSHMAN (continues) (CONT'D)                         Fuck, that's good shit. So, what's                         say we make a go of this and you                         drop off the cash tomorrow?               Finally.                                                                    CUT TO:               INT.

He                         said he wants to meet up at a bar in                         Red Hook. You know where that is?

BOBBY                         What do you mean 'troughed?'                                     HORRACE                         Troughed off. Protected.

HORRACE                         Nah, man. No one is. They got some                         Puerto Ricans and a new crop of                         fuckin Irish immigrants.                                     RICKY                         I'm half Irish.                                     HORRACE                         I don't fuck with those crazy,                         off-the-boat fuckin Irish. You heard                         of the Westies?.                                     BOBBY                         Heard of them.                                     HORRACE                         They ran shit back in the Eighties.                         Used to cut motherfuckers heads off                         and sit them on the bar. That's back                         when the Irish was making a play                         against the Italians. I don't know                         if they still around, but I don't                         fuck with those motherfuckers just                         in case.                                     BOBBY                         It sounds to me like everybody's                         just a little jumpy. And since all                         it is is a drop, the Welshman's got                         nothing at stake. I say we go to his                         'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his                         nerves, we drop the bag, and we all                         get back to our lives.

Did Ricky call                         yet..? See you in a minute.               He sits up, hunched over. He motivates reluctantly. He               claws his way into the bathroom and rinses his face in a               meagre attempt to wash away the cobwebs. He looks awful. The               COLORS are beginning to INTENSIFY as sleep deprivation sets               in.               INT. LIMOSINE - MANHATTAN - DAY - MOMENTS LATER               Bobby sits into the car once again. Jimmy pulls away.

Bobby fights to clear his head and think.               EXT. CITY STREET - MANHATTAN - DAY               The limo pulls up, and Horrace steps in, talking on the               phone. Horrace carries a BRIEFCASE.               INT. LIMOSINE - MANHATTAN - CONTINUOUS               The car pulls away. Bobby has the no-sleep-sweats. He looks               awful. No one greets anyone. There is a tension. Horrace is               on the phone.                                     HORRACE                              (phone)                         Yeah... Yeah... Uhu...

LIMOSINE - BROOKLYN - SAME               Bobby is watching and thinking as Brooklyn goes by. Horrace               seems distant.               EXT. ICARUS TAVERN - RED HOOK - BROOKLYN - DAY               The limo passes the corner and settles in front of the time               worn Icarus Tavern.               A young IRISH MAN stands out front smoking a fag. The place               is open, but the neon 'OPEN' sign is off.               INT. LIMOSINE - IN FRONT OF THE ICARUS - CONTINUOUS               They pop the doors.                                     HORRACE                         This is it.                                     BOBBY                         Where's Ricky.                                     HORRACE                         I guess inside. Or he never made                         it. Either way, I don't give a shit.                         Let's get this over with.               EXT. ICARUS TAVERN - RED HOOK - CONTINUOUS               The two guys get out and enter the pub. Horrace carries the               case of cash. The guy at the door watches them enter and               snuffs out his smoke.               INT. ICARUS TAVERN - RED HOOK - CONTINUOUS               They enter the old world gin mill. It's dark. There's a               long, aged wooden bar and oak booths. The floor boards are               faded and bowed. A middle-aged BARTENDER reads the Post by               the oversized beer taps. He looks up over his reading               glasses without expression. Two young Irish TOUGHS stand up               from a booth and lead the men into the back room. There is a               silent tension. No sign of Ricky.               INT. BACK ROOM - ICARUS TAVERN - CONTINUOUS               Even darker. They slowly walk in, sending cautious looks to               every corner. A simple round table sits in the center of               this sparse dining room. Three ROGUES sit around it, all               facing the door.  Tom, the Welshman, sits with his back to               the door. They all have pints before them. A muted               conversation ends as Tom follows their stares over his               shoulder to see Bobby and Horrace enter. Silence for a BEAT,               then...                                     WELSHMAN                         Here they are, then.                                     HORRACE                              (falsely relaxed)                         How's it going?                                     WELSHMAN                         Brilliantly. Care for a pint?                                     HORRACE                         No, thanks, man. We got to head out.                                     WELSHMAN                         Come, now. You just got here.                                     HORRACE                         That's alright, man. It's a little                         early for me to drink.               This draws an uncomfortably bass chuckle from the seven               dark characters now surrounding them.                                     WELSHMAN                         Nonsense. We'll have three half                         pints of lager.               One Irishman goes to fetch the drinks. Two of the Irishmen               pat them down for guns.                                     WELSHMAN (continues) (CONT'D)                         Sorry about that. Where's your mate?                                     HORRACE                         Couldn't make it. Here's the money.               Horrace places the case on the table. Its weight makes a               loud thunk as it hits the hardwood. He pops the catch and               lifts the lid. Wow. That's a lot of money. The toughs lose               their poker faces as their knees weaken from the sight of               it. Even Bobby has to swallow as the Devil blows on his               nape. Tom fingers the stacks.                                     HORRACE (continues) (CONT'D)                              (anxious)                         Give me your marker, and we'll be                         on our way.               Tom begins to write out a receipt.                                     WELSHMAN                         I can't yet vouch for the amount,                         unless you want me to sit here and                         count.                                     HORRACE                         No, man, that's fine. Just put that                         you took delivery.               Then, in what takes only a matter of seconds, Bobby has a               LOCKBLADE to his THROAT and Horrace takes a truncheon to the               gut, flooring him.                                     HORRACE (continues) (CONT'D)                         What the fuck, man? Why? The                         money's in your hand. Why you                         pulling this shit?               Tom is scared shit. He's more surprised than any of them.                                     WELSHMAN                         I... I just hired these guys to                         watch my back...                                     HORRACE                         Motherfucker, we're handing you                         money. What the hell we gonna pull?                                     ROGUE                         Shut your goddamn mouth! As far as                         any of you are concerned, a gang of                         spics took the bag. Understood? Grab                         their wallets. I'll know where to                         find each and every one of you.                                     WELSHMAN                         didn't know, I swear to God, I-               WHACK. He takes one in the gut, violently losing his wind.                                     HORRACE                              (to Bobby)                         If you and your boy set this up,                         you're way out of your league.                                     ROGUE                         Shut up!                                     VOICE (O.S.) (O.S.)                         Maybe you're the one who better                         shut up.               They all turn to see RICKY standing tall with a PISTOL to               the head of a tough with two beers. Ricky sips the third               lager.                                     ROGUE                         He's only got six shots, he's bound                         to miss.                                     RICKY                         Or maybe I'm real lucky. I'll tell                         you one thing, I'll waste every                         bullet making sure you're dead if                         you don't take that knife away from                         my friends throat.               The thug removes the blade from Bobby's neck. His eyes               narrow as he looks at the gun. He notices something...                                     THUG                         That's a starter pistol.                                     RICKY                              (covering)                         What?                                     THUG                         His gun's a starter pistol. I can                         see the red plug in the barrel.               The toughs begin to relax and converge...                                     RICKY                              (nervous)                         Are you willing to risk your life                         over-               But the moment proves enough of a distraction for Bobby to               unload a damaging COMBINATION to his captor. He may not have               what it takes to cut it as a professional boxer, but these               untrained goons are way outclassed. He drops one like a lead               weight. It's about to get ugly as weapons are raised.               Then... The melee is cut short by a resounding VOICE calling               from the door.                                     JIMMY                         That's enough.               Jimmy the driver stands in the door aiming a Glock 45 at               the crowd.               They all freeze.                                     JIMMY (continues) (CONT'D)                         You guys, over in the corner. Leave                         the hardware and your wallets on the                         table.                              (to bartender)                         Make out an invoice on damages. You                         got e-mail?                              (nods. Jimmy hands                              him a card.)                         E-mail it to me. A check will                         arrive. Call the number at the                         bottom and tell them the Rook is                         code four. Then destroy the card.                              (to Bobby)                         Nice. I'll let Maxie know you're                         good in the pocket.                              (to Ricky)                         Staduch.                              (to the guys)                         Go. I'll take care of this.               Things are about to get ugly. Bobby grabs the case. They               split.               EXT. ICARUS TAVERN - RED HOOK - MOMENTS LATER               They get in. The limo pulls out.               INT. LIMOSINE - IN FRONT OF THE ICARUS - CONTINUOUS               Horrace peels out and Bobby, Ricky, Horrace, and the Red               Dragon all sit in silence catching their breath. Bobby holds               the case. Looks are exchanged.                                     RICKY                         Holy shit. Get me back to Manhattan.                                     BOBBY                              (interrupts)                         Take us right to Kennedy. Now.               Horrace nods.                                                                  FADE OUT.               FADE UP ON:               INT. MAX'S OFFICE - VAN NUYS - DAY               Bobby and Ricky sit before Max. They look the worst we've               ever seen them. They've obviously not slept or changed yet               and flew right out after the melee.               Maxie looks at the open case of cash.               A long, tense BEAT of unclear reaction. Is Maxie mad or               happy. Finally...                                     MAX                         You did good.               He throws them each a bundle off the top of the pile of               bills. Ten grand stacks?                                     MAX (continues) (CONT'D)                         I never intended to test you two to                         that extent, but you both came                         through. I should've been informed                         there was a flag on the play, but                         I'll take that up with Ruiz. I made                         a few calls back East. Those punks                         weren't tied in with anyone. As for                         the Welshman, he wasn't in on it. He                         was just plain dumb. As for you,                         Ricky, your draw will go towards a                         new carpet cleaning van.                                     RICKY                         But, Max-                                     MAX                         We're square.                                     RICKY                         Yes, sir.                                     MAX                         And, as for you, Bobby, you just                         moved up a notch. Your days of                         fighting for crumbs is through. Take                         a week off, come back, and we'll                         talk about the next thing.                                     BOBBY                         There won't be a next thing.                                     MAX                         Take a few days-                                     BOBBY                         I don't need a few days. I'm gonna                         settle down with Jess. She's through                         dancing. We're opening a restaurant.                                     MAX                         Hate to ruin your fairy tale, but                         I've been paying Jess' rent for six                         months. She's got to keep dancing-               Bobby throws his stack of cash at Maxie. Ricky grimaces.                                     BOBBY                         She's through too. Thank you for                         the opportunity, Max. We'll see you                         around.               They rise to leave.                                     MAX                              (smiling)                         You got a lot to learn, kid. Say hi                         to Jess for me.               EXT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - BLACKBURN - LOS ANGELES - CONTINUOUS               - NIGHT               The Trans Am pulls up in front of Jess' house. Bobby and               Ricky both pop out. We catch the end of a conversation.                                     RICKY                         Dude, we were practically made...                                     BOBBY                         I'll drop you off in a minute. I                         want to see if the baby's up. You                         wanna come in?                                     RICKY                         No. I'll wait here.                                     BOBBY                         I'll be a minute.               Bobby trots up the stairs. Ricky lights a smoke and watches               him go. We linger on his look.               INT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - BLACKBURN - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT               The door opens. The living room looks like a disaster area.               The sink is full of dishes, stacked high above the counter.               Dirty clothes are strewn all over. Half eaten plates of food               are on the coffee table and bags of carry-out containers and               pizza boxes lie about. In the center of it all, Chloe sits               alone watching a Hollywood Hills brushfire on the news.  She               looks up with the solemnity of one much older.                                     BOBBY                         Where's mommy? Did she leave you                         alone again?               Chloe looks to the back room as she sips from her juice               box. Bobby sees a MIRROR and COKE laid out on the table. He               grits his teeth and goes for the bedroom door.               INT. BEDROOM - JESSICA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS               Bobby bursts in to find Jess in bed with the HORNY BACHELOR               whose nose he broke the week before. The guy jumps in fear.               Jess is startled and coked out of her mind.                                     HORNY GUY                         I-I-I...

JESS                         I never promised you anything.                                     BOBBY                         How could you let her see this?                                     JESS                         Goodbye, Bobby.                                     BOBBY                         Just so you know, I bought you out                         with Maxie. I suggest you leave                         while you can.                                     JESS                         Don't you get it? I don't want to                         leave. This is who I am.                                     BOBBY                         Tell you the truth, I don't give a                         shit for me. But that little girl is                         so special, and you're gonna fuck                         her up.               He crosses to go, but is interrupted by...                                     JESS                              (quietly)                         Take her.                                     BOBBY                         What'd you say?                                     JESS                         I want you to take her with you.               Off Bobby's look we...                                                                    CUT TO:               INT. FRONT ROOM - JESSICA'S HOUSE - NIGHT               Bobby walks in. Chloe looks up at him. A tense silence.                                     BOBBY                         I, uh ... Listen, hon. Mommy thinks                         it's a good idea if, just for a                         while, if you and me go on a trip-               Before he can finish, his stammering is cut short by her               bolting across the room and into his arms.               She squeezes him with all her might.               We see Bobby's relief and happiness over her shoulder.                                                                   FADE TO:               EXT. BOBBY'S CAR - SMALL DESERT HIGHWAY - OUTSIDE LOS               ANGELES - NEXT MORNING               We FADE UP on a beautiful sunny morning travelling on an               empty desert road. The only car visible is Bobby's Trans Am               in the deep background, leaving the mountains behind. The               CAMERA TRACKS BACKWARDS along the road as the car closes               slowly. We hear Chloe's angelic voice as she sings a melody.               As the car draws closer, we see Bobby, still in the clothes               from the trip, driving. There is luggage packed for a               journey. Bobby looks content. When the car finally settles               into a TWO-SHOT through the windshield, we notice SMOKE               coming from the back seat. A moment later, Ricky sits up               behind them. He is half awake and cranky.                                     RICKY                         Baby, you got the sweetest voice I                         ever heard, but Uncle Ricky's gotta                         sleep. I've been driving all night,                         Princess.               She ignores him.                                     RICKY (continues) (CONT'D)                         Shhh, c'mon, baby. It's quiet time.                         Isn't it quiet time, Bobby? Bobby?                         Tell her it's quiet time Bobby.                         Please tell her it's quiet time...               Bobby smirks and accelerates, passing CAMERA, which PANS to               watch them speed off into the big sky horizon.                                                             FADE TO BLACK.
