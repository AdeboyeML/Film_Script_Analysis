          1 AERIAL PANORAMA - DAY TO NIGHT 1

          A slow, steady, downward view. The camera seemingly
          floats as the curve of the globe passes beneath.
          Beginning in the green jungles of Sikkim in Northern
          India it crosses the Himalayas, down into Tibet and
          beyond to China - the zigzag line of the Great Wall
          clearly visible. Then the Gobi desert is flowing
          beneath, and as the light begins to fade, Mongolia gives
          way to the Russian Steppe, and as dusk turns to night we
          are over Siberia - gliding North over Lake Baikal, and
          onward across forested hills and valleys. A sense of
          utter remoteness in this silent landscape. Then a tiny
          shaved patch within the primeval forest - a bald
          rectangle of ground, crisscrossed by faint probing
          lights. The camera slows, and hovers.

          Out of the blackness, the momentary glimpse of a barbed
          wire fence, lit by the combing fingers of a searchlight.
          Another angle, and the silhouette of distant timber
          buildings is briefly etched, before the light passes and
          all is again in darkness. Closer, on a canvas-sided
           barrack building - ghostly shadows projected on the wall.

          3 INT. BARRACKS, CAMP 105, SIBERIA - NIGHT 3

           A long rectangular building, the walls lined with two
           tiered bunks of rough-hewn logs. In the centre - a metal
           stove with a chimney stretching out through the roof. A
          dim central bulb illuminates some 150 men, aged from 16 
          to 60, most sitting or lying on their bunks. Some wear
          scraps of army uniform, or civilian clothing, others in
          prison issued padded jackets. Some, from the Asian
          territories, still ear something of their national 
          costume. Included among them are groups of foreigners
          from recently occupied countries and a Babel of languages
          drifts through the fetid air. It's a wide ranging mix of
          types, of race, of class. They're miserable, starving
          and ill. There is no camp camaraderie and they eye each
          other with indifference or suspicion. Most of these men
          are political prisoners, known as 'Politicals' or
          'S8ers', after the section of the Soviet Penal Code that
          has put them here.
          Near the stove, and contrasted with the 'Politicals', a
          group are gathered about a card game on a lower bunk.
          These men look healthier, and are further distinguished
          by their tattoos.

          criminals, and from their manner the undisputed masters
          of the block.
          Sitting facing each other - VALKA, thirties, heavily
          tattooed, flash of a steel-caped tooth. His opponent,
          BOHDAN, older, and the 'Pakhan', the 'boss' of this
          criminal gang. Bohdan shuffles a deck of home-made
          cards.

          BOHDAN nods to his minder who opens a battered wooden
          suitcase - a glimpse of hoarded food. The minder puts
          his hand on a lump of bread lying beside a length of
          sausage. BOHDAN nods. The bread is placed beside the
          coat.

          BOHDAN shuffles and deals. He separates his cards with
          the long fingernail of his little finger. In a few rapid 
          plays, VALKA is left coat-less. 
          Apart from the half-dozen thugs surrounding the players,
          the game is watched by two 'Politicals', who have just
          entered with a load of wood for the stove. The elder,
          SMITH, a hard-face man in his late forties, the other
          ANDREI, early twenties. VALKA signals to YURI who takes
          three 'tailor-made' cigarettes from his pocket, passes
          them carefully to VALKA who lays them before BOHDAN.

          Smiles from the gang. VALKA knows he's being mocked but
          he's desperate. His eyes flick down to the sausage.
          Then he takes off his shirt. He sits bare-chested, a
          tattooed portrait of LENIN on his left breast looking
          across at STALIN on his right. BOHDAN deals, and again
          VALKA loses.
           VALKA's mate YURI places a padded prison jacket over his 
           bony shoulders, which he shrugs off irritably, then

          late thirties, the other, LAZAR, late twenties. Furtive

          the set of underwear for a hank of tobacco. KHABAROV
          having done the deal splits the tobacco with LAZAR.
          Moving quickly to complete a second deal, KHABAROV swaps
          half his share of the tobacco with another prisoner for
          two slices of bread. He waits until the last of the
          men leave then he carefully breaks off a corner from one
          piece of bread, concealing the rest in a hiding place in
          the dirt at the base of his bunk - a glimpse of a cache
          of hoarded food and other items.

          his eyes. He can hear a guard shouting outside, but he
          hesitates, carefully licking his fingers. He stares at
          his hand. Close on a spot between his fingers - there's

          watchtowers placed at regular intervals along the
          perimeter. In the distance, dense forest.
          Entering frame a column of close to a hundred men march

          HEROISM'.
          The prisoner is JANUSZ, early twenties and he exchanges a
          look with the man beside him, TOMASZ, about the same age. 
          ANOTHER ANGLE shows a line of prisoners, five abreast,
          marching toward them on their way to work. They have
          their attendant guards and dogs and as the two columns
          pass each other the contrast between the half-starved,
          ill looking 'old' prisoners and the comparative health of
          the 'new', could not be more apparent - 'Is this what we
          are to become?' on the faces of the 'new'. We glimpse
          some of those already established - they include BOHDAN,
          and VALKA, and further back - SMITH and KHABAROV. As
          they pass they look across to JANUSZ and TOMASZ, both
          Polish, and behind them to VOSS, a tall young Latvian
          with a mop of white-blonde hair. Behind VOSS - ZORAN, a

          cut timber, coils of wire, and work going on replacing
          old canvas-sided barracks with new timber ones.
          The Spring thaw has turned recently melted snow into
          slush, and duck-boards are hastily laid to allow the
          Commandant to cross to the assembled prisoners. He walks
          with his subordinate and LAZAR who is FOREMAN of the new
          camp construction. LAZAR carries a sheaf of plans, and
          the COMMANDANT stops, studies a drawing, then impatiently
          issues an order dismissing him.
          The COMMANDANT mounts a box, accepting a folder of
          documents from his subordinate, who has in turn received
          them from the escorting guard. The COMMANDANT surveys
          the prisoners before him. He's a man in his fifties with
          a bland but not unintelligent cast to his features.
          He looks up from the collection of documents in his hand.

          Siberia is your prison. All four

          Later, the newly arrived prisoners exit the wash-house,
          heads and beards shaved. In the background a glimpse of
          others waiting their turn. To one side of the wash-
          house, a pile of their luggage. A couple of guards sort
          through their belongings, pocketing the odd item.
          JANUSZ, VOSS and KAZIK, heads shaved, exit the hut.
          JANUSZ's attention is caught by the men working on
          replacing the old stockade wall with a new double barbed-
          wire fence. The overseer, LAZAR, gives a signal and a
          section of the old wall falls to the ground.

          The prisoners move in a line toward an open window in the
          side of the kitchen building. Here, under the watchful
          eye of the cook - one of BODHAN's men - a single serve of
          thin soup is slopped into their metal bowls. One has no
          bowl, so he uses his hat.
          JANUSZ and his friends shuffle toward the window.
          Their attention is caught by a group of blind prisoners
          feeling their way along the side of the kitchen hut, a
          hand on the shoulder of the man in front.

          SMITH, a couple of places ahead in the line, turns on

          As JANUSZ moves forward he watches several wild-eyed men
          scrambling about in a pile of kitchen slops thrown into
          the mud by the kitchen door. They find here the odd
          scrap of food, or simply soak their fingers in the slime,
          then lick them clean.

          SMITH, having been served, moves away, retrieving a
          hoarded slice of bread from within his jacket. He dips
          it into the soup, raises it to his mouth when a corner of
          the bread drops to the ground. One of the garbage-
          eaters, dives for it, but SMITH is too quick for him,
          placing a boot over the scrap of bread. JANUSZ watches
          as SMITH picks up the bread, cleans off the dirt and eats
          it, his every move watched by the starving man at his
          feet. JANUSZ offers the remainder of his soup to the man

          work harder or move faster. Death is casual here. A man

          JANUSZ and his group dump a load of trimmed logs in a bay
          by the mine entrance. He hesitates as the others move
          away, staring into the black hole leading into the

          of utter dread on his face.

          contribution the cut pile of logs is a long way from the
          mark showing at the top of the storage bay.
          BOHDAN, the overseer, moves amongst the various working
          gangs, measuring their completed piles of logs. JANUSZ's
          group are still only half way to a full quota. KHABAROV
          leaves his gang and approaches JANUSZ.

          buried in fallen leaves and drifts of snow. He clears
          away the leaves and snow to reveal a pile of old grey cut
          timber.

                          SMITH
           Yes, but lose 200 men and you'll
           have some forms to fill out.
           Could go badly for you.
          The GUARD dimly considers this. The prisoners begin to
          stir, some shouting out that they should turn back. The
          GUARD alarmed, orders the prisoners to the ground - other
          guards level their rifles as the mass of men lay down on
          the freezing ground. All but SMITH.

                         SMITH (CONT'D)
          We could move into the forest,
          find shelter!

          GUARD NO. 1
          Lie down!
          The GUARD is about to leave when to his astonishment, and
          that of the other prisoners, SMITH begins to walk toward
          the forest edging the road. The GUARD draws his pistol.
          On the ground ZORAN lies beside JANUSZ, as they watch the
          unfolding drama.
          GUARD NO. 1 shouts for SMITH to return, others raise
          their rifles, waiting for his order to fire. He is
          conflicted, and after a tense moment gestures for them to
          lower their weapons.

          GUARD NO. 1 (CONT'D)
          Let the prisoners take shelter in
          the trees! Shoot anyone who makes
          a run for it!
          JANUSZ stares after SMITH, admiring of his reckless
          courage.

          AB30 FOREST, LATER - DAY AB30
          The men work frantically collecting fallen timber. SMITH
          watches as VOSS picks up a massive log, places it on his
          shoulder and carries it to where JANUSZ is supervising
          the building of their shelter. Most of the other
          prisoners have just piled snow up around bundles of
          sticks to make windbreaks, but JANUSZ is building
          something more elaborate. SMITH's eyes miss nothing as
          he notes JANUSZ's skill and the way the others work as a
          team under his direction.

          Some distance away VALKA huddles alone against the trunk

          for the group.

           JANUSZ calls KHABAROV to join them, but he declines
           politely. He moves on to find SMITH - invites him back
           to their improvised shelter. As SMITH sits, ZORAN offers
           his hand.

                         SMITH
          That's right.
          As the blizzard grows in intensity, JANUSZ reaches into
          his pocket for strips of pine-bark collected earlier. He
          hands them out to his companions. They watch as he chews
          on the bark. The others follow his example.
          Watching from a short distance away is GUARD NO. 1. He
          takes note of the group as future troublemakers.

           The men are stirring, struggling up to face another day, 
           when the door opens, and in a flurry of snow, GUARD NO. 1 
           enters with another soldier. He orders SMITH, JANUSZ and 
           his group to fall out. As he passes SMITH -

          30 INT. MINE - DAY 30

          A labyrinth of twisting tunnels leading down into the
          frozen earth. Dim lights silhouette ghostly figures
          working with pick and shovel. Occasionally the muffled
          sound of a distant explosion as a gallery is blasted yet
          deeper. Mingling with these eerie sounds something more
          sinister - the hacking coughs of those who've done the
          most time in this frozen hell.
          The man working beside JANUSZ wields a pick, JANUSZ
          shovelling out the rock as it breaks up. The man pauses
          to light a smoke. His fingers have moulded themselves
          into the shape of his pick-handle - they are like hooks,
          the man unable to straighten his fingers. He holds the
          cigarette with the tips of his fingers, as if his hand
          was an artificial limb. JANUSZ looks around desperately,
          fighting off an overwhelming feeling of claustrophobia.
          Despite the cold, sweat beads on his forehead.

          31 INT. DEEPER IN THE MINE - DAY 31

          KAZIK and a man known as 'THE PROF', drag a cart laden
          with rock up a steep incline. They wear horse collars
          attached to the cart by leather harnesses.

          contrast to his lively intelligent eyes. He says
          something to KAZIK in Russian. He shakes his head. He
          doesn't speak Russian. THE PROF tries German, then
          English.

          KAZIK manages a look at his companion, before putting
          even more effort into dragging the load.

          32 INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE MINE - DAY 32

          A man, enveloped in clouds of white steam, points a long
          pipe at the frozen rock and gravel - the heat making it
          easier for the pick and shovel men to dig. This is the
          'POINT-MAN', and he opens and shuts valves on the pipe-
          stem which regulates the hot steam that travels along
          pipes leading back to a primitive boiler. Men try to
          warm themselves by working near the POINT-MAN, and when
          the guards are not around they clutch the pipes in their
          hands gaining a few moments of precious warmth.
          SMITH knows how to work the system and has found a spot
          here working beside the POINT-MAN. He looks across to
          see JANUSZ staggering up the slope toward the distant
          mine entrance, where a guard can be seen silhouetted
          against the light. He watches a moment, something not
          right about JANUSZ. He lays his shovel aside and hurries
          after him.

          JANUSZ scrambling toward the surface. He stumbles, falls
          to his knees. He looks down, sees something on the
          ground.

          JANUSZ'S VISION - DAY 
           Something buried in the dirt and rubble - paving stones.
          He clears away the debris to reveal a stone path.
          Looking up he sees the path leads to a gate framed by a
          hedge. His P.O.V. as he moves up the path to the gate.
          His unseen hand opens the gate. Now the view is of the
          path as he walks forward - a series of worn flagstones,
          then the camera tilts up to see a closed front door. A
          pan to the left of the door - to see a loose brick in the
          wall.

          34 INT./EXT. TUNNEL - DAY 34

          CLOSE on JANUSZ, as SMITH is suddenly beside him,
          grabbing his arm and swinging him into the darkness of an
          adjoining tunnel.

                         SMITH
          Are you crazy? They'll shoot you.

                         JANUSZ
          Got to get out!
          SMITH stares at him. He's delirious and begins to shake
          with cold. SMITH grabs his shoulder and drags him back
          to where the POINT'-MAN works, thrusting JANUSZ's hands
          around the pipe. The POINT-MAN waves them away but SMITH
          bribes him with a slice of bread. SMITH turns back to
          JANUSZ - the warmth of the pipe beginning to have its
          effect.

                         JANUSZ (CONT'D)
          It can be done.

          SMITH slaps a hand over his mouth, glancing at the Point-
          Man, before dragging JANUSZ further away.

          I've spent half my life in the
          woods and mountains. We'll live
          off the land.

          It can't be done!
          JANUSZ shocked at the change in his friends' demeanor,
          the appalling realization that SMITH was right about him.
          He seizes his arm.

                         JANUSZ
          How do we get through the wire?

          Your friend, Lazar, he knows
          doesn't he?
          A look of fear crosses KHABAROV's face. Someone behind
          JANUSZ. JANUSZ turns. VALKA, a few paces away watching
          them. KHABAROV scuttles back inside the barracks.
          JANUSZ hesitates a moment, then follows.

           In the last minutes before lights out the would-be
           escapees make discreet preparations. Clothing and other 
           items are traded for food and tobacco. The COOK and 
           BOHDAN are at the center of the camp black-market and
           most of the trading is done with them. TOMASZ trades
           more pornographic sketches with BOHDAN while KAZIK tries 
           to trade his scarf for a pair of boots - his own being in 
           poor shape. VOSS sits beside him, and notices that KAZIK 
           does not look directly at his shoes or the scarf, but is 
          doing everything by feel. As they move away VOSS
          whispers to him.

                         VOSS
          You can't see, can you?

          Please don't tell them. I'll die
          here.
          JANUSZ and SMITH sit in a darkened corner working on
          LAZAR. They want to know how to get through the wire.
          He is reluctant until SMITH produces a wristwatch from
          his boot. The strapless watch, of good make, settles the
          deal, just as the light flickers and goes out plunging
          the barracks into darkness.

          The wooden building creaks and heaves like a ship at sea
          as the storm builds into a fully fledged blizzard. The
          sounds of the sleeping men, the usual cries and groans,
          hacking coughs, all mix into the howl of the storm.
          CLOSE on the conspirators lying awake - SMITH, VOSS,
          KAZIK, TOMASZ and ZORAN. SMITH looks across to JANUSZ,
          catches his eye. A signal from JANUSZ, 'not yet'.
          KHABAROV too, is awake. He jumps at any unexpected
          sound, checks his horde of food in the hiding place at
          the base of his bunk, as if expecting at any moment to be
          attacked and robbed. He sees a shadow. Someone moving
          about near him, a look of terror on his face.

          LATER,
          JANUSZ lies on his back listening to the storm. A
          movement beside him, then a knife pressed against his
          throat. It's VALKA. He grins, steel-capped teeth, his
          cross dangling from his neck. JANUSZ goes still.

                         VALKA
          There are no secrets here.

                         JANUSZ
          What do you want?

                         VALKA
          The game goes against me. Small
          debt - lose fingers. Big debt, 
          they take head. Me, big debt.
          But one thing I never gamble is my
          Wolf.
          He removes the knife from JANUSZ's throat, tilts the
          blade to show a wolf's head incised into the blade.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          In forest you need knife to 
          survive. Without? A miracle.
          He leans in close to JANUSZ's ear.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          You need a knife, and I need
          miracle to get me out of here.
          With a conjurer's ease he spins the knife in his fingers
          and arches his eyebrows - 'Deal'?

          Heavy snow still falling as shadowy figures run toward
          the wire. Shouted commands and the beam of a searchlight
          isolates them - not the fugitives, but a group of guards.
          They've found a gap in the wire. A great yelping and
          baying as the dog-handlers join them, releasing the dogs
          into the gap, then following them toward the distant
          forest.

          40 EXT. FOREST, SIBERIA - DAWN 40

          Then seven fugitives, now including VALKA, weave in and
          out of the trees at a fast jog. Snow whirls about them,
          as, gasping for breath, they attempt to keep up with
          JANUSZ. In the rear KAZIK holds onto VOSS' rope belt,
          occasionally stumbling, but VOSS has him up and on his
          feet fast enough to keep up with the others.
          JANUSZ pauses briefly every now and then to study the 
          moss growing on the North side of tree-trunks, before 
          plunging on Southward. 

                         41 FURTHER ALONG 41 
          They top a rise to a clearing and pause to catch their

          no rest and moves off without a backward glance.

           VALKA, drags him to his feet.

          A feeble light penetrates the forest as day begins. The
          snow still falling heavily as the men stumble into a deep
          depression, and facing a steep climb find they can go no
          further. KAZIK turns his face to the light. His sight
          is returning with the day and he nods gratefully to VOSS.
          In the deep stillness the sound of distant voices. They
          look about them. Hard to tell the direction of the
          sound. JANUSZ is on his feet - there's plenty of fallen
          timber but no obvious place to hide. He draws a circle
          in the snow, mimes digging to the others, then turns to
          VALKA, whispers.

                         JANUSZ

          With a glance to the others he reluctantly draws his
          knife from his boot and passes it to JANUSZ.
          While the group furiously dig, JANUSZ collects and trims
          fallen timber. As the hole deepens, JANUSZ begins to
          make a trellis roof. The voices change direction. They
          go still. Are they surrounded? They resume their
          digging with greater intensity, the hole now more than a
          meter at its deepest, JANUSZ placing the branches to
          cover their hide.

          defensively across his eyes, staggers and falls to his
          knees. JANUSZ turns back, drags him to his feet. KAZIK

                         ZORAN
          Once upon a time, in the days of
          wooden ships, there was a great
          storm in far away seas. A
          merchant ship hurried toward big
          rocks, lightening in the sky, the
          waves as high as house-tops.
          Very, very cold, brrr! The ship
          smashed onto the rocks, the
          sailors cried in fear, called out
          to God, but they all drowned. All
          but one, Mr. Robinson Crusoe. He
          woke to find himself all alone on
          a desert island. For many years
          he lived without any human
          companions, until one day he saw
          something shocking! What was it?
          A human footprint. He was no
          longer alone. But was the
          stranger friend or foe? Another
          ship wrecked sailor? Or, a
          cannibal?
          All turn as a flicker of flame begins at the base of the 
          kindling. While JANUSZ blows at the flame, MR. SMITH 
          feeds in small shavings. The group watch with the awe 
          and wonder usually reserved for child-birth. Then
          everyone is making a contribution - adding a few leaves,
          or tiny twigs, like offerings, as the fire grows and
          spreads.

          drowse in the life-giving warmth, when a pile of snow
          lands on the fire. The others react. It's JANUSZ. He
          heaps on more snow and the fire sputters out.
          By the time the others are on their feet JANUSZ is almost
          out of sight and they hurry to catch up, fearful of being

          No one moves. JANUSZ reaches into his own pockets,
          emptying the contents onto the cloth - several slices of
          bread, half a kilo of buckwheat, some dried meat, a
          swatch of tobacco. SMITH goes next with a larger store
          of bread and a little salt. VOSS has a collection of
          small fish-heads which he adds to the store. TOMASZ,
          KAZIK and ZORAN make their contributions. They stare
          grimly at their limited food supply. Various other items
          are added - a razor blade, a length of cord, a piece of

          at the others, then passes it to him. TOMASZ has already
          begun to organize seven slices of bread laying one of
          VOSS's fish heads on each. one. He hands them out. They
          eat in silence, savoring every bite. ZORAN removes the
          fish-head, passing it back to TOMASZ. Then he places a
          thin layer of snow on the bread like a canape. He eats
          daintily, his little finger extended like a dowager at a

          bones or teeth for various uses.
          JANUSZ; Works on the reindeer skin. With SMITH's help he
          stretches it to dry on a driftwood frame. Later, he cuts
          a piece off and gives it to VOSS for the back-pack. He
          also works scraping the skin of strands of unwanted meat
          and fat.
          IRENA; Sleeps and eats. It is only at dusk one day she
          seems to come to life and moving to the lakeside washes
          her clothes and hair. The men try not to stare, and
          whether their thoughts are carnal or not, whether she
          reminds them of family or girlfriend, they are all
          affected by her transformation from boy/urchin, into a
          young woman when she returns washed, and wearing the
          dress she has carried rolled-up on her back.

          SMITH and JANUSZ some distance from the campsite
          collecting wood. By the fire ZORAN leads the 'Survivors
          Band'. He has them drumming on logs, tapping sticks,
          harmonizing, amid much laughter. JANUSZ watches IRENA.
          Then he turns to SMITH.

                         JANUSZ
          She's educated. Speaks good
          English. And French.

          Refreshed and revived and laden with their supplies from
          the deer, they make their way along a narrow dirt track
          by the lake. IRENA is aware that the main opposition to
          her joining with them comes from VALKA and SMITH. SMITH
          she knows is the more important, and she tries to keep up
          with him. Occasionally catching his eye, she tries to
          charm him with a coquettish smile beyond her years.

                         103
          A river flowing into the lake presents an obstacle. They
          walk along the edge to where the river begins to narrow,
          but here it's still frozen, and a quick test with
          JANUSZ's staff shows it to be too thin to take their
          weight. They look upstream - a distant figure of a man,
          a hunter possibly, a shotgun over his shoulder, on their
          side of the bank. There's clearly no choice but to swim
          for it. They make hasty preparations, removing outer
          clothing, except shirts and trousers, tying their boots
          about their necks. IRENA watches.

                         SMITH
          Can you swim?

                         IRENA
          Yes, Mister.

                         SMITH
          You wouldn't lie to me?

                         IRENA
          I'm not lying, Comrade.
          That was a slip of the tongue, and SMITH is made uneasy
          by it.

                         SMITH
          And don't call me, 'comrade'.
          With a shout the group plunge into the icy water,
          swimming one-handed, their packs held above water level
          in the other. It's only when they reach the other side
          they realize IRENA is still on the opposite bank. The 
          others urge her to swim across. She hesitates a moment
          then runs upstream to where the river is frozen.

          They watch in astonishment as in a series of leaps and
          bounds she's out on the ice heading for the opposite
          bank. Ice cracks beneath her feet and a couple of times
          it seems she'll fall in, but with a last great leap over
          a section of free-flowing water she makes it to the other
          side, hurrying down to join the others a broad smile on
          her face. She looks defiantly at SMITH. JANUSZ is
          worried about the man having seen them, and urges them to 
          follow him into the tree-line.

           They scramble up a steep, forested slope, with occasional 
           backward glances to see if the hunter is following. 
           There's no sign of him.

           Some time later the group, still a little damp, walk by 
          the lake. IRENA walks beside SMITH whose long strides
          force her to jog occasionally to keep up. They swat at
          mosquitoes as they walk.

          we were 'kulaks', and exploiting
          the peasants. My parents were
          afraid and hid me in the barn.
          The mosquitos are getting worse and SMITH grabs swatches
          of leaves, passing one to IRENA as they walk on, swinging
          away at the annoying insects.

          foodstuffs including a freshly killed rabbit and a bottle
          of vodka.

          vodka bottle is passed hand to hand. When not drinking,
          the group are swatting at the persistent mosquitoes,
          ZORAN now badly bitten. VALKA doesn't seem bothered by
          the mosquitoes, perhaps tatoos keep them away, anyway
          he's feeling generally pleased with himself and is very
          talkative.

          slug of the vodka.

          toward the trees where the others are approaching down a
          wooded hillside. He hurries toward them, urging them to
          take cover in the bracken beside the track. SMITH points

          approaching train.

           Close on the faces of the escapees as they look up to the 
           carriages stopped in front of them. They are cattle- 
           cars, but its soon apparent their cargo is human. From 
           the high windows, hands can be seen clutching the bars.
           From inside a communal groaning and sighing. Voices, 
           female voices, cry out for water, and on the agonized 
           faces of the fugitives a mixture of pain and empathy.
           Then the train seems to sigh, like a great beast, and
           from beneath the carriages flow streams of blood and
           urine. As the distant light turns green the train slowly 
           moves forward, and as it does so, letters and notes drop
           to the tracks from the barred windows.
           After it is gone they scramble over the tracks into the

          some scrawled on the back of photographs. They are
          mostly names and addresses, pleas for someone to mail or
          inform relatives of what happened to them - some have

          IRENA uneasy, squints in the direction of the hills. And
          you can feel it. Like a John Ford western there's a
          sense of being in Indian territory, of their every move
          watched by unseen eyes.

           of getting food. 

          139 EXT. ABANDONED TEMPLE COMPLEX, STEPPES - DAY 139 

          Within a walled compound they wander between a series of
          recently abandoned Buddhist temples and out-buildings.
          By the size of the compound, several hundred monks may
          have lived here. Everywhere are signs of violence -
          doors hang from hinges, and a large statue of Buddha lies
          smashed in a courtyard. JANUSZ points to a line of
          bullet impacts, stitched across a wall.

          There are bloodstains on the floor, and the wind howling

          The same as happened in Russia.
          Churches closed, priests shot or
          taken to camps, religion banned.
          They came to my church, in Latvia.
          Destroyed everything, declared it
          a 'museum'. Later that night,
          there was a lone guard. A boy.

          As they head South, each is lost in their own thoughts
          when seemingly out of nowhere a half-dozen Mongolian
          horsemen are galloping toward them. The horsemen circle
          them, far from friendly looks on their faces. They wear
          the traditional costume of Steppe nomads and range in age
          from a man in his seventies down to a six-year-old boy.
          The OLD MAN pulls up his horse in front of SMITH,
          figuring as he's the oldest he'll also be the leader.
          The groups stare at each other. The OLD MAN speaks in
          Russian, a rough guttural accent.

          No. American.
          The OLD MAN maybe doesn't get the 'American' part, but he
          gets that they are not Russian. He seems pleased about
          that.

          Daughter.
          IRENA moves closer to him. SMITH puts a protective arm
          about her shoulder. The OLD MAN considers the situation
          for a moment longer before abruptly turning, and followed
          by his band, galloping off toward the distant hills.
          Looks between the group, not exactly of relief, as
          there's a feeling it may not be the last they see of the
          riders. IRENA looks up at SMITH, smiles at him.
          Something about him calling her his daughter has touched
          some hidden place. SMITH, a little embarrassed, smiles
          back.

          142 EXT. RIVER'S EDGE, MONGOLIA - DAY 142

          While SMITH fishes in the river, others tend to their
          battered feet. VOSS passes around deer fat in his
          improvised deer skull container. This they rub over raw
          patches, and between their toes where deep cracks have
          developed. JANUSZ repairs their footwear, while TOMASZ
          sits by the fire sketching IRENA. ZORAN, the camp
          barber, trims hairs and beards

          horseman watches them approach. He's the young boy from
          the group of horseman who originally approached them.
          They pause before him. He looks at them a moment then
          tosses a goatskin bag at their feet before galloping off
          in the direction from which they came. VOSS picks up the
          skin bag, gives it a shake. Water.
          They continue on to the edge of the ridge and a view of a

          JANUSZ has taken a reading of the sun, using his stick

          The group hesitate on hearing a distant roaring sound up
          ahead. Nothing on the horizon. Then they are hit by a
          fierce wind, as toward them rolls a vast cloud of sand.
          They drop to the ground instinctively, and huddled
          together throw blankets around their shoulders and over
          their heads, as they are engulfed in the choking sand.

          The group rest under the meagre shade provided by their
          coats. SMITH walks away from them, and crests a slight
          rise. From here he has a clear view to the horizon. Off
          in the distance a dark patch against the light sand.
          Through the dancing mid-day light he sees shapes. Trees?
          He staggers back to the group.

          in Siberia when he walked away from the guards. Perhaps
          it is this memory that causes the others to turn
          silently, and collecting their few possessions, to follow

          A clump of straggly tortured trees surround a desert well
          - a low square of ancient stones. They sprawl by the
          well, SMITH reaching down inside with their bowl to bring
          up a scoop of crystal clear water. It's passed around
          rapidly.

          through frame, ending in a close-up of TOMASZ, his breath
          coming in short gasps.

          The five figures, small in frame, TOMASZ the last in
          line, down on his knees. He raises a hand, hasn't the
          strength to call out. Then one of the figures sees him,
          calls to the others.
          CLOSE on TOMASZ.
          He pulls the leg of his trousers up with difficulty - the
          tell-tale swelling of the ankles, just as with IRENA. As
          JANUSZ approaches he quickly covers his legs and staggers
          to his feet. JANUSZ steadies him, and taking his arm
          they continue.

          As they walk the landscape changes from the endless
          scrubby plain to sweeping sand dunes. The nature of the
          terrain makes the going slower and they move forward on
          the edge of exhaustion. In a curious freak of Nature the
          wind whips across the top of the dunes creating an eerie
           singing sound. Ahead, and across their path a massive 
           dune - no way forward but over it. TOMASZ looks up, 
           staring in horror - 

                          TOMASZ'S HALLUCINATION: 
           The dune is moving, rising up, higher and higher, like a 
           massive sand wave.
           Back on TOMASZ. He collapses, unconscious.

           An eerie, ghostly twilight, the group all sitting 
           together in a rough circle around TOMASZ. He seems to 
          revive as he passes around sketches he's made during
          their imprisonment and escape.

          SMITH passes the sketch to JANUSZ as TOMASZ lays back
          down, a smile on his face. He looks up at the stars. He
          knows he's dying and has accepted the fact. This in turn
          has given strength to his friends, and between them all
          is a feeling of love and a kind of peace.

          They've tied his pencil to a length of hide, and hung it

          moves out of the circle of firelight into the desert. He
          pauses, listens again.
          A scraping sound. Then he sees them coming out of the
          gloom - JANUSZ dragging an unconscious SMITH by his
          shoulders. VOSS hurries to them. A look from JANUSZ -
          'water'? VOSS shakes his head, 'No'.

          A black snake, thick as your wrist, slides over ZORAN'S
          leg. He stares, too close to death to feel fear. He's
          not even entirely sure it's real. He watches its
          progress as it slithers up the rocky hillside. Then he
          gets it, and he's up, running on pure adrenaline,
          following after the snake, leaving his sleeping
          companions by the fire.

          down into a rocky defile, followed by ZORAN.

          fifty metres up the hill. A native? Black mud obscures
          his face. It's ZORAN. He waves, dances about, then in a
          cracked voice, a single word drifts down to them.

          small pools of water, split lips, puffed and bleeding.
          At first, just to swallow is painful, but it is life.
          After each mouthful there is a moment they must wait as
          the seepage re-fills the little hollows.

          and VOSS. JANUSZ holds his hand up for them to go very
          still. He speaks in a whisper.

          He passes the knife to VOSS, then creeps toward the
          creature, and striking quickly he attempts to trap the
          snake in the fork. Too slow. The snake disappears into

          Next morning, and the figures of the four men are seen in
          wide-shot sleeping by the embers of their fire. One
          figure gets up, picks up his staff, and begins to walk
          slowly South, toward the distant mountains. It's SMITH.
          The others stir, their attention caught by the sight of
          SMITH staggering onward. JANUSZ knows what the effort to
          walk is costing him, and he knows this is SMITH's gift to
          him. They hurriedly pack up, VOSS cramming the back-pack
          with roasted snake-meat, ZORAN collecting a last bowl of
          water, which he pours carefully into their goatskin water-
          bag.

          fingers; another submerges himself entirely; one drinks,
          savoring every mouthful as if it were the finest vintage
          wine. SMITH fishes. Beside him several of his catch

          It is snowing. VOSS is the first to rise. He looks
          about him in disbelief, shakes the others awake,
          pointing. Just beyond where they've slept a high wall
          towers above them. In this extreme Western section it's
          in poor shape - not built of stone, but of ancient mud
          bricks, tumbled down in many places, but to the East the
          outline is distinct as it straggles over ridges to the

          much bowing opens the door for two other Tibetans who
          follow. One is a LPMA, the other a local OFFICIAL. They

          scrubby birch-woods, rhododendrons, and deciduous forest,
          until finally it becomes dense rain forest. It is with a
          backdrop of this luxuriant green that Indian faces look
          up toward the slopes. Here they watch three wild looking
          bearded men descending toward them. The additional cost
          of this final leg of their journey is plainly visible on
          their faces, and in their slow stumbling movements. They
          walk like automatons, only their senses fully alive.
          Shouts from the locals produce a village ELDER, then a
          POLICEMAN. Older children squeal with delight, while
          some of the very young cry out in fear, one even bursting

          The camera moves toward a gate in a hedge. The click of
          the latch as it opens. A downward view of the
          flagstones. The front door, the camera pans left. The
          loose brick. A hand into frame removes a key from behind
          the brick. Into the lock of the door, the door pushed
          open.

          222 INT. HOUSE, POLAND - DAY 222

          A WOMAN sitting by a window. She's in her early
          seventies, and she looks up expectantly on hearing the
          door closing in the hallway. At the entrance to the room
          appears a young man in Polish cavalry uniform - YOUNG
          JANUSZ, as he was just before the war. He smiles at his
          wife. Cut back to the seat by the window to see his
           pretty YOUNG WIFE, as she was back in 1939. YOUNG
           JANUSZ, smiling broadly, crosses toward her. Cut back to
          his WIFE of 1989 - on her face there are lines of
           suffering which fade as she smiles up at him. She's
           waited a long time for him to come home. On JANUSZ now
           as he sits opposite her, and for the first time we see
          him as he is in 1989 - also in his early seventies.
           Without a word he reaches across the table and takes her
          hand in his.

          FADE TO BLACK.
