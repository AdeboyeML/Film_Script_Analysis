1   EXT. ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)                                1

    Heavy leaden skies over the arachnoid stands and floodlights
    of Elland Road stadium: home to Leeds United football club.

    And rain. Sheets of angry, Yorkshire rain.

    TITLE: "THE DAMNED UNITED"


2   INT. BOARDROOM - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)                    2

    Flashlights pop as DON REVIE, (late 40's), the most
    successful manager in English football, walks out in front of
    a pack of newspaper and TV REPORTERS. He is flanked by the
    Chairman of Leeds United, (MANNY CUSSINS, 60's), and several
    other white-haired blazer-wearing members of the Board.

                        REVIE
           I'm just going to make a brief
           statement.

    CAPTION: "JULY 4th, 1974"

    REVIE stands under a large trophy cabinet, filled with the
    silverware he has won. REPORTERS wait: intimidated. Cowed.

                        REVIE (cont'd)
           Yesterday afternoon at 3.00, I
           accepted the FA's offer to become the
           next manager of the England national
           football team.

    A gasp among the JOURNALISTS. A burst of flashlights. The
    BOARD MEMBERS look down at the floor in silence. Bereaved
    fathers losing their favourite son.

                        REVIE (cont'd)
           Obviously that involves me leaving
           Leeds United after 13 happy and
           successful years, which makes me very
           sad. I'd like to think I have built
           the club into a family and there must
           be sadness when anybody leaves a
           family. However, when one man goes,
           another steps into his place. I know
           who I think that person should be, the
           man to replace me, and I shall make my
           feelings clear to the directors. Thank
           you. No further comments.

    REVIE turns and walks out, a volley of REPORTERS shouting
    questions...

                                                  FADE TO BLACK:

3   EXT. MOTORWAY - DAY - (1974)                                  3

    We're in a car. Tarmac passes beneath us. Roadmarkings.

    OVER THIS: the sound of a flat Teeside voice, singing along
    with Frank Sinatra on the radio...

                        VOICE (V.O.)
           "Fly me to the Moon.."


4   INT. CAR - DAY - (1974)                                       4

    Two young BOYS, (12, 9) stare out of car windows. Raindrops
    on the panes of glass. Their father, BRIAN CLOUGH, (39),
    slick, modern, cocky, handsome. About as big a contrast to
    DON REVIE as it's possible to find, is up front. Driving..

                        CLOUGH
                  (singing)
           "And let me play among the stars.."

                        SIMON
           When are we there?

                        CLOUGH
           Any moment now. On the right.
                  (singing)
           "Let me see what spring is like..."

    The car turns a bend, and suddenly the floodlights and stands
    of a football stadium come into view. The BOYS' eyes widen.

                        BOY 1
           There it is! Dad! There it is!
    The BOYS smile in excitement.

                        CLOUGH
                  (singing)
           "..on Jupiter and Mars.."

    `LEEDS UNITED FOOTBALL CLUB' written on the side of the
    stadium. CLOUGH smiles, then puts his foot down. The car
    accelerates past the turning. The BOYS' smiles fade.

                        BOY 1
           Where are you going? Dad? You've
           missed it.

                        CLOUGH
           We've something else to do first.
           Won't take long.
                  (singing)
                        (MO RE)
                                                      (CO NTINU ED)

             "In other words, hold my hand. In
             other words, darling kiss me..."

    The MUSIC continues as the car drives on, turning into the
    MUSIC of a television program..


5   INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY - (1974)                          5

    The `CALENDER' front title sequence, a Yorkshire TV current
    affairs program. We're in a TV studio. The presenter is
    AUSTIN MITCHELL, (40)..

                          MITCHELL
             Today we welcome Brian Clough as he
             starts his new job as manager of Leeds
             United, taking over from Don Revie -
             the most successful manager in the
             club's history, under whom Leeds have
             won everything..
                          CLOUGH
             ..not QUITE everything. Not won the
             European Cup...

                          MITCHELL
             ...but pretty much everything else.
             Daunted?

                          CLOUGH
             Daunted? Not at all, Austin. Looking
             forward to it.

                          MITCHELL
             The biggest challenge of your life,
             and you'll be without Peter Taylor,
             for the first time. Your lifelong
             professional colleague.

                          CLOUGH
             Yes, Pete's at Brighton now. He had
             the opportunity to come with me, but
             Brighton was his choice. Leeds was
             mine.

                          MITCHELL
             A surprising choice, some might say.
             Because you've been very vocal in your
             criticism of them over the years.

                           CLOUGH
             I have.

                                                                              4
5    CON TINUE D:                                                5

                           MITCHELL
              You've accused players of dirty
              tactics, cheating, dissent, foul play.
              You called Norman Hunter, Norman
              "Bites yer legs" Hunter, you've said
              Peter Lorimer falls when no one
              touches him...

                           CLOUGH
              And I was right.

                           MITCHELL
              I'm curious. Why do you now show such
              alacrity to joining them after such
              vituperative criticism of them for so
              long?

                           CLOUGH
              Goodness, it's going to take me half
              an hour to explain all those words for
              a start.

     Laughter from the camera CREW..

                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              Football is a beautiful game, Austin.
              It needs to be played beautifully. I
              think Leeds have sold themselves
              short...


5A   INT. REVIE'S HOUSE - SAME TIME                              5A

     CLOUGH's interview continues on a TV in a sitting-room, where
     it is being watched by Don Revie, sitting in an armchair...
                           CLOUGH (ON TV)
              ..they've been champions but they've
              not been good champions in the sense
              of wearing the crown well. They've not
              been loved. But then that's hardly
              surprising, given the type of
              operation there's been in place there.

     CLOUGH continues...

                           CLOUGH
              Football clubs are like families,
              footballers are sensitive people. I'd
              like to bring a little warmth into the
              set-up...

                           MITCHELL
              "That type of operation?" I presume
              you're referring to Don Revie..

                            CLOUGH

     REVIE continues to watch the TV...

                           MITCHELL
              ..who has long been regarded as a
              father figure in Leeds. And now you're
              coming in as the outsider, the enemy
              even, after all the things you've said
              in public, coming in and taking ouver
              as STEPfather.

                           MITCHELL
              Don't you expect some degree of
              resentment to this?

                           CLOUGH
              I would accept and expect a
              strangeness, initially, it's   perfectly
              normal. But it won't be long   before
              they realise I'm a fair man.   A kind
              man. And maybe under me they   can
              experience what it's like to   be in a
              happy family, after all.

                            MITCHELL
              How can you be sure they weren't happy
              with Don all along?

                           CLOUGH
              They wouldn't have played football
              that way if they were happy.

5E   INT. REVIE'S HOUSE - SAME TIME                                5E

     DON REVIE's eyes burn with indignation. He picks up a
     telephone, and angrily starts to dial..

     Here they are. The Leeds PLAYERS. Long hair and long faces.
     Surly. Truculent. Dangerous.

     Out on the practice pitch. In the rain. Some doing warm-up
     exercises. Others milling dangerously in groups. Their names
     on their purple track suits.

     CLOUGH's car pulls up. He and his sons get out. A few waiting
     press. Cameras. Lights. A few FANS with autograph books.

                           JIMMY GORDON
              Where have you been, boss?

     JIMMY GORDON, CLOUGH loyal trainer, his face creased with

            Morning lads! Lovely Yorkshire
            weather!
                   (gestures shivering)
            I tell you makes me want to jump on a
            plane right back to Majorca!

    CLOUGH laughs. The PLAYERS stare in silence. Squinting in the
    drizzle. Condensation coming from their mouths.

    JOHNNY GILES stares. BILLY BREMNER spits and continues
    talking disrespectfully.

                         CLOUGH (cont'd)
            Not much of a welcome, was it? And not
            so much as a smile from Johnny Giles.

                         JIMMY
            You're five days late!! And did you
            really need to say that about Majorca?
                   (beat, changing the
                    subject)
            You know he was Revie's first choice
            for getting your job.

                         CLOUGH
            Who? Johnny Giles?

    CLOUGH looks over at GILES, who turns away, resumes
    training....

                         CLOUGH (cont'd)
            Was he now? And Bremner?

                         JIMMY
            Club Captain. Don's son and heir. His
            first born. You're never going to get
            any love from him.

    BREMNER, a flint-eyed Scot, stares at CLOUGH..

                         CLOUGH
            Great. Here's to happy fucking
            families.


8   INT. CORRIDOR - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)                     8

    JIMMY GORDON leads CLOUGH and his BOYS down a corridor, where
    countless photographs of DON REVIE hang on the walls. Holding
    silverware.

    They pass an open door, with a sign outside, `MANAGER. Mr.
    DON. REVIE.' CLOUGH stops. Looks at the sign.

    CLOUGH walks into the manager's office. The empty chair. The
    bare desk. His desk. Don's desk.

    CLOUGH takes a seat in the chair.

    Presently, a middle-aged matron, JEAN REID, Don Revie's
    faithful SECRETARY for 13 years, appears in the doorway..

                        CLOUGH
           Any chance of a cup of tea, duck?

                        JEAN
           They're waiting for you. Upstairs.

    CLOUGH swings his feet on the desk.

                          CLOUGH
           Who's that?
                        JEAN
           The Directors.

                          CLOUGH
           For me? Why?

                        JEAN
           For the board meeting.

                        CLOUGH
           Let them wait. Now, how about that cup
           of tea?

    CLOUGH smiles sweetly, but JEAN stares at CLOUGH. She
    pointedly doesn't move. CLOUGH lowers his feet.

                        CLOUGH (cont'd)
           All right, I'll go then. Wouldn't want
           to get off on the wrong foot.

    CLOUGH walks over to the door. Looks at the desk.

                        CLOUGH (cont'd)
           Who's desk is that, love?

                        JEAN
           Yours, Mr. Clough.

                        CLOUGH
           Not mine. I didn't put it there, did
           I?

                          JEAN
           Mr. Revie's.

              Let's get rid of it then, shall we?
              Chairs, too. The whole bloody lot.
              Think it would be best if there were
              nothing of his left here.

     CLOUGH reaches the door..

                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              Were you his secretary?

                           JEAN
              I was. For thirteen happy years.

                           CLOUGH
              What's your name, pet?

                           JEAN
              Jean, Sir. Jean Reid.
                           CLOUGH
              In which case, no offence duck, but
              there's nothing I want typed on paper
              from you other than your resignation.

     She gasps..

                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              And you can change the locks on your
              way out. Don't want the ghost of
              troubled Don popping in now, do we?
              Rattling his chains. Scaring my young
              ones.

     CLOUGH puts his arms protectively round the BOYS, and leads
     them out of the door. JEAN REID stares, visibly shaken.


10   INT. BOARDROOM - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)                  10

     Half-a-dozen white-haired patriarchs sit at a large table.
     Matching blazers and matching brass. MANNY CUSSINS, SAM
     BOLTON, BOB ROBERTS, SYDNEY SIMON, PERCY WOODWARD.

     Aldermen and Rotary club members. Masons and businessmen.

     CLOUGH enters the boardroom. Indicates to JIMMY GORDON to
     look after the BOYS outside. Inside: matching curtains and
     carpets.

                           CUSSINS
              Come in, Brian.

     CLOUGH sits down at the head of the table. Rubs his hands
     together..

     The DIRECTORS shoot looks at one another.

                           CUSSINS
              Why did you do it?

              The interview. For Yorkshire TV.

                           CUSSIN
              We've had a phone-call.

                           BOLTON
              Not so much a phone-call. Bloody
              tirade.

                           CUSSINS
              From Don. They only went and rung him.
              And ran some of your quotes by him.
              About how unhappy the players were.
              What "bad champions". Looking for a
              response.

                           BOLTON
                     (shudders to himself)
              Bloody got one, as well. He's gone
              berserk.

                           CLOUGH
              He had it coming. He shouldn't have
              done that piece in the Mirror should
              he? Saying he thought I was a daft
              choice.

                           BOLTON
              He's entitled to his opinions.

                           CLOUGH
              And I'm entitled to mine.

                     (barks, flame on)
              And I'm entitled to MINE.

     The room falls silent. That got everyone's attention.

               Thank you. I'm the best old one, too.

               feeling this is all about you and Don?

                            CLOUGH
               Of course it's just about me and Don.
               Always has been. But instead of
               putting frowns on your foreheads, o ye
               elders of Leeds, in your blazers and
               brass fucking buttons, it should put
               big white Colgate smiles on your big

               sleep and won't eat until I take

               to hear the name "Don Fucking Revie"
               again -- beat it so the only name
               anyone sings in their Yorkshire ale
               houses, raising their stinking jars to
               their stinking mouths, is Brian

     CLOUGH puts on his suit. Ties his tie. He takes a bottle of
     vintage red wine from a cupboard.

     He places the bottles on his desk. Then puts two cut crystal
     glasses on his desk. His and Don's.

     A flicker of jealousy on PETER TAYLOR's face, almost like a
     wife - hurt that his friend is making such an effort for
     someone else.

     A knock on the door. JIMMY GORDON appears in the doorway..

                          JIMMY
             They're here!
                    (a confused look)
             Well, almost..

                                                                              15


23   EXT. CAR PARK - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - (1968)               23

     CLOUGH rushes out of the doors, straightening his cuffs,
     straightening his hair, buttoning his jacket. First out to
     greet the arriving team.

     He turns the corner to see the LEEDS COACH a hundred yards
     down the street, the PLAYERS getting off the coach and
     walking towards him..

                         CLOUGH
            What are they doing?

                         JIMMY
            They've run out of petrol.

                         TAYLOR
            No, it's that superstition, isn't it?
            Every away cup ties, Revie makes them
            walk the last hundred yards.
     TAYLOR mutters under his breath, "Soppy twat".

     CLOUGH cranes his neck. Watches DON REVIE, 40's. Thick-set.
     Severe, forbidding, intimidating, in a huddle with his
     coaching staff, Les Cocker and Syd Owen. His henchmen. His
     assassins. His "Goodfellas". His right and left hand.

     CLOUGH walks towards him. Hand outstretched..

                         CLOUGH
            Welcome to Derby, Don. Pleasure to
            meet you. I'm Brian Clough.

     But REVIE walks past without shaking hands, without talking,
     without even breaking stride..

     ..and disappears into the stadium, deep in conversation with
     Les Cocker and Syd Owen.

     CLOUGH stares. Hand still outstretched. He looks over at
     PETER TAYLOR, who can't help smiling, `Forget it'.

     TAYLOR and JIMMY GORDON walk off, but CLOUGH still stares at
     REVIE in disbelief.


24   EXT. DUG-OUT - TOUCHLINE - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - (1968) 24

     The LEEDS PLAYERS run out onto the pitch: HUNTER, MADELY,
     BREMNER, GILES, REANEY, JONES, in a line, waving to the
     crowd, turning North, South, East, West...

     TAYLOR rubs his hands in excitement, "Here we go". But CLOUGH
     is miles away. Still cannot let the insult go. He stares over
     at the visiting team dug-out..




                                                          (CO NTINU ED)

24   CON TINUE D: (2)                                              24

     REVIE and his lieutenants. Whispering among themselves.
     Huddled in thought. Huddled in strategy. Huddled in
     malevolence.

     Presently, the game starts. A roar from the crowd.




                                                          (CO NTINU ED)

24   CON TINUE D: (3)                                              24

     "Beeeep", the REF's whistle blows. A Derby PLAYER rolls in
     agony, cries out, a terrible, cynical challenge. Horrified,
     JIMMY GORDON and PETER TAYLOR up on thier feet in protest..

                             TAYLOR
             Referee..!

     CLOUGH looks over to REVIE's bench. Sees REVIE and SYD OWEN
     quietly applauding the Leeds PLAYER. Encouraging more of the
     same. As the Derby PLAYER is stretchered off..

     Presently, RRROOOOAAAARRRRR goes up. Goal Leeds. REVIE and
     his henchmen get to their feet. Applauding. 1-0.

     TAYLOR and JIMMY GORDON immediately start shouting out
     encouragement to the Derby PLAYERS, new instructions, as the
     game restarts..

                          TAYLOR (cont'd)
             C'mon, keep your shape! Close him
             down!

                          JIMMY
             Think, Alan! To feet!

                          TAYLOR
             Now sent it out wide!

     CLOUGH doesn't join in. He continues to stare at REVIE in his
     dugout.

     Suddenly:

     "Beeep!", whistle! Penatly Leeds! CLOUGH leaps off the bench
     in outrage. Screaming, on his feel, protesting in disbelief..
                          CLOUGH
             What? He didn't fucking touch him!
             Ref! He DIVED! He fucking dived!

     REVIE shaking hands with his COLLEAGUES. Smiling amongst
     themselves. Congratulating themselves. Celebrating.

     The inevitable roar as Leeds convert, followed by,
     "Beeeeeep", the sound of the final WHISTLE. CLOUGH stares in
     disbelief. Robbed. Deflated.

     The REFEREE blows the whistle for the end of the game.

     CLOUGH watches as REVIE and SYD OWEN brush past, shaking
     PETER TAYLOR and JIMMY GORDON's hands, (assuming TAYLOR's the
     manager), on their way to the dressing-rooms, their minds
     already on their next game...

     CLOUGH stares as they go..

                                                                          16aA

                           CLOUGH
              Didn't say good-bye. Or pay me the
              respect of staying for a drink.
              Couldn't wait to get away.

     Through the front door we see: DON REVIE, SYD OWEN and LES
     COCKER walking to their bus, chuckling to themselves, deep in
     discussion, already thinking about the next match.

                           TAYLOR
              Bloody cheats and all. Neither of
              those goals should have been allowed.

     But CLOUGH doesn't hear...

                           CLOUGH
              Just going to have to beat them, Pete.
              Beat him it's the last thing I do.

                           TAYLOR
              We need to get into the same division
              first.

             We need someone with a good head.
             Experience.

                          TAYLOR
             I know. Our lot were like headless
             chickens out there today.

     CLOUGH turns to TAYLOR...

                          CLOUGH
             First thing Monday morning, I want you
             to go and find me that player. A wise
             head.

     TAYLOR opens his mouth, is about to protest..

                          CLOUGH (cont'd)
             And don't worry about the money.
             That's my problem. Just you go and
             find him.

     CLOUGH's face: watching the Leeds PLAYERS board the bus...

                                                              CUT TO:

     CLOUGH's face: staring out at the Leeds PLAYERS waiting on
     the training pitch. A deep breath.

                          CLOUGH
             Right. Better go and make myself
             known.
     CLOUGH removes his jacket. JIMMY GORDON and CLOUGH's SONS
     watch as he walks out onto the training pitch...


27   EXT. TRAINING PITCH - FOLLOWING DAY - (1974)                       27

     CLOUGH walks out into the drizzle and towards the LEEDS
     PLAYERS..

                          CLOUGH
                    (up-beat, clapping hands)
             All right, gentlemen, gather around,
             please.

     The players truculently gather round. CLOUGH watches them,
     notes their mood, then..

                          CLOUGH (cont'd)
             I might as well tell you now.

              You lot may all be internationals and
              have won all the domestic honours
              there are to win under Don Revie, but
              as far as I'm concerned, the first
              thing you can do for me is to chuck
              all your medals and all your caps and
              all your pots and all your pans into
              the biggest fucking dustbin you can
              find because you've never won any of
              them fairly. You've done it all by
              bloody cheating.

     Silence from the PLAYERS..

                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              Mr. William Bremner. You're the
              captain. And a good one. But you're no
              good to the team and you're no good to
              me if you're suspended. I need you fit
              for every game, and I want good,
              clean, attractive football from my
              captain. Setting an example.

     CLOUGH turns to PETER LORIMER.

                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              Mr. Lorimer, I hope you were listening
              because you're as good a footballer as
              I've ever seen, but you know how I
              feel about the way Don let you
              harangue referees, fall over when
              you've not been touched, protesting
              and pointing, trying to get other
              players booked. We'll have no more of
              that.
     CLOUGH turns to JOHNNY GILES..

                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              And you, Irishman. God gave you skill,
              intelligence, and the best passing
              ability in the game. What God did not
              give you was six studs to wrap around
              another player's knee.

                           GILES
              I don't know what you're talking
              about.

     CLOUGH turns to NORMAN HUNTER...

                           CLOUGH
              But you do, though, "Bites yer Legs".

                          CLOUGH
             Not with me as manager. Do that on my
             watch, you'll be fined and stuck in
             the reserves.
                    (to all the PLAYERS)
             Things are going to be a little
             different around here. Without Don.
             Might feel a little strange at first.
             Might pinch a little. Like a new pair
             of shoes. But if you want your
             grandchildren to remember you for
             being something other than the dirty
             buggers you all were, if you want to
             be loved as REAL champions, WORTHY
             champions, you're going to have to
             work. And improve. And change.
                    (nods to JIMMY GORDON)
             Now let's start off by playing some
             seven-a-sides.
     PLAYERS stare at one another. Bristling. Disbelieving looks.

                          BREMNER
             Don never did that.

                          CLOUGH
             Well, I'm not Don. And from now on I
             never want to hear that man's name
             again. Ever. Next player who mentions
             it, or what he did or didn't bloody do
             in the good ol' days, will spend a
             week cleaning my boots.
                    (clapping hands)
             Seven-a-side. Keep it nice and clean,
             and sensible. No fifty-fifty's.
     CLOUGH sees that one side is a man short..

                          CLOUGH (cont'd)
             Right, I'll play myself. You might
             learn something, Irishman. Two hundred
             and fifty-one goals in two hundred and
             seventy-four starts.

     CLOUGH skillfully traps the ball between his feet, flips it
     up onto this head - down onto his chest, then "WHAM" volleys
     it into a distant goal..

                          CLOUGH (cont'd)
             Like to see Don fucking Revie do that,
             eh?

     CLOUGH removes his track suit trousers, rolls his neck. JIMMY
     GORDON quickly divides the players into two teams, blows the
     whistle..

     The game starts. CLOUGH, leading by example, anxious to prove
     himself, is soon darting about, calling out...

                          CLOUGH (cont'd)
                    (clapping hands)
             Here, son. To feet. Keep it simple.
             Think and give. On the deck. Nice and
             crisp. Yes, to me, Sniffer. To me.

     CLARKE passes the ball. But it's a fifty-fifty. Another
     player bears down on CLOUGH..who refuses to pull out..

     "CRUNCH", a bone-shaking tackle from "BITES YER LEGS".

                          CLOUGH (cont'd)
             Oh, Jeeeeeesussss!!!

     CLOUGH is flattened. Rolls around on the floor. JIMMY GORDON
     runs up to NORMAN HUNTER..
                          JIMMY
             Fucking matter with you? He said no
             fifty-fifty's.

     HUNTER aggressively steps forward. Nose to nose. He is
     immediately flanked by other aggressive Leeds PLAYERS.
     Crowding the referee. Intimidating him.

                          HUNTER
             What are you going to do about it?
             Book me?

     JIMMY GORDON backs off, visibly frightened. CLOUGH lies on
     the floor. In agony. Holding his knee.

28   INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE DRESSING-ROOMS - SAME TIME                  28

     CLOUGH listens to the PLAYERS laughing at him. Disrespecting
     him. His face darkens.

             "Two hundred and fifty-one goals in
             two hundred and seventy-four starts."

     The sound of coarse, cruel laughter among the LEEDS PLAYERS.
     JIMMY GORDON appears, CLOUGH's two SONS in tow..

                          JIMMY
             I've got what you were looking for.

     JIMMY holds up a large parcel wrapped in brown paper.
     CLOUGH's expression changes.

                           CLOUGH
              What about the petrol?

                           JIMMY
              In the boot of the car.

                            CLOUGH
              Good lad.


29   INT. CORRIDOR - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)                      29

     CLOUGH limps down a corridor. In a thunderous mood. Holding
     the parcel. PEOPLE scatter.


30   INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)              30

     The door flies open. CLOUGH storms into his office. He walks
     over to the desk. DON REVIE's desk.
     He unwraps the parcel, and takes out an axe.

                            CLOUGH
              Stand back.

     CLOUGH's SONS watch as their father violently swings the axe
     down onto the desk. The sickening sound of splintering wood.


31   EXT. ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)                                 31

     CLOUGH watches the desk burn in a small bonfire outside.
     MANNY CUSSINS and several DIRECTORS walk out.
     They are surprised to see CLOUGH by the fire holding an
     axe...

                           CUSSINS
              Everything all right?

                           CLOUGH
                     (sunny, waving with the
                      axe)
              Fine thank you, Mr. Cussins.

     CLOUGH smiles politely, then turns, and walks to his car. The
     DIRECTORS watch..

                                                           CUT TO:

32   INT. CLOUGH HOUSE - DINING-ROOM - DAY - (1968)               32

     "Rrrriiinnnggg", the phone rings. CLOUGH and his FAMILY are
     having Sunday lunch. BARBARA CLOUGH looks up..

                         BARBARA
            Not now, love - please?

     "Rrrrriinnngggg". The phone rings. CLOUGH tries to ignore it.

                         CLOUGH
            But it might be Pete.

                         BARBARA
                   (rolls eyes)
            Of course it's Pete.

     "Rrrriiinnngggg", CLOUGH tries to eat, then..

                         CLOUGH
            But it might be important.
                   (to NIGEL)
            C'mon, eat your carrots. For your
            Mother.

     CLOUGH gets up. Walks out of the room..


33   INT. TAYLOR HOUSE - HALL - DAY - (1968)                      33

     PETER TAYLOR, similarly in disgrace with his family,
     similarly unable to go a single Sunday lunch without calling
     CLOUGH, whispers down the phone, terrified of his wife..

                         TAYLOR
            You asked me to find a player with a
            good head. Experience.
                   (whispering, furtive)
            I've found one! He's perfect. Dave
            Mackay.

                         CLOUGH
            Dave Mackay?!? He's a hundred and
            fucking fifty.

                         TAYLOR
            I admit he's not young.

                         CLOUGH
            Not young? He's old as fucking time!

                         TAYLOR
            But he's clever, keeps the ball well.
            And passes it better than anyone
            alive.

     A voice calls from TAYLOR's dining-room..

                           LILIAN (O.S.)
              Pete...! That's enough! Come back!

                           TAYLOR
                     (looks left and right)
              He's the one, Brian.

                           CLOUGH
              You sure?

                           TAYLOR
              Never been more sure of anything in my
              life.

                           CLOUGH
              All right, I'll talk to Longson in the
              morning.
                           TAYLOR
              We haven't got until morning. Hearts
              have already made him an offer. Want
              him as their manager. Apparently
              they've already agreed terms.

                           CLOUGH
              Well, what did you fucking call me for
              then?

                           TAYLOR
              Because when I asked Bill Nick how
              done the deal was - he said ninety-
              nine per cent.
     CLOUGH's face.

                           CLOUGH
              Meaning he hasn't signed.

                           TAYLOR
              Exactly.


34   INT. CLOUGH'S HOUSE - DINING-ROOM - DAY - (1968)            34

     BARBARA CLOUGH rolls her eyes, puts down her cutlery, and
     calls out..

                           BARBARA
              All right, Brian. Enough. Come back
              now..

     No answer. BARBARA tuts to herself. Gets up from the table.
     She walks out of the dining-room, calling out..

     ..and into the hall. BARBARA stops. She looks left and right.
     No sign.

37   EXT. ROADSIDE CAFE - DAY - (1968)                               37

     CLOUGH and TAYLOR emerge from a roadside cafe and walk
     towards their car. They've missed Sunday lunch. So it's
     Crisps. Sweets. Fizzy drinks. Almost childlike. Happier in
     one another's company than with their own families.

                            CLOUGH
               Where would we play him?

                            TAYLOR
               In the middle of the park. Somewhere
               he can see everything, use his loaf,
               and tell the kids what to do.

                            CLOUGH
               We'll play him as a sweeper, then.

                            TAYLOR
                      (eating crisps)
               Aye.

     They climb into the waiting car...

                            CLOUGH
               Won't have to run about too much. And
               what's all this I hear about a tie
               shop?

                            TAYLOR
               He's got a tie shop, hasn't he? In
               London. Which he spends two days a
               week at.

     CLOUGH starts the engine...

                            CLOUGH
               Fucking tie shop?

             No one's going to be wearing fucking
             ties in twenty years time.

     CLOUGH and TAYLOR both giggle. Like kids. The car pulls
     off...

                          CLOUGH (cont'd)
             Hope his footballing brain is better
             than his business brain.


38   EXT. MACKAY'S HOUSE - NORTH LONDON - DAY - (1968)                 38

     CLOUGH's car pulls up outside a house in a quiet terraced
     road in North London. TAYLOR checks it against the address on
     a piece of paper. The two men get out of the car...

                          CLOUGH
             You know it's illegal. To sign someone
             on the sabbath.

                             TAYLOR
             Is it?
                    (immediately cautious)
             Then perhaps we should just shake on
             it today? And sign tomorrow?

                          CLOUGH
             What? And let Hearts in again in the
             morning? Fuck off.
                    (producing contracts)
             I'm not leaving here without a
             signature.
     CLOUGH and TAYLOR walk up the garden path..

                          CLOUGH (cont'd)
             You'd bloody DO that, too - wouldn't
             you? Come all this way, then just
             "shake hands"?
                    (shaking head)
             Dear oh dear. What would you DO
             without me?

                          TAYLOR
             Hey, you would never have FOUND him if
             it weren't for me.

     CLOUGH stops, rings the doorbell. Looks at TAYLOR.

                          CLOUGH
             Good job we're both wearing ties.

     dark-haired bull of a man, with a thick Scots accent. CLOUGH

              against you in an Under-23 match.

                           MACKAY
              I remember you now. You had a black
              eye, a right bloody shiner.

                           UNCLE SAM
              I'm not. What were you thinking? Going
              over my head like that? Why didn't you
              call?

                           CLOUGH
              Because you'd have said `no'.

              Bloody right I'd have said `no'. The
              man's bloody crocked.

                           CLOUGH
              Pete reckons he's good for three more
              years.

                           UNCLE SAM
              Is he fuck. He's broken more bones
              than Evel Knievel.

                           CLOUGH
              Trust me, Mr. Chairman. It's money
              well spent.

     LONGSON turns and double-takes....

                           CLOUGH
              That'd be Messrs. McGovern and O'Hare.

              and Sunderland. Very reasonable, too.

     CLOUGH smiles..

                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              Just doing what's best for the club.

              You're a genius, Pete. Bloody genius.
              How did you see it?

     On the training ground: DAVE MACKAY, barrel-chested and
     older, voice like a bullhorn, is already bossing about the
     young players, urging them to "think"..

                           TAYLOR
              Dunno. It was just obvious. McGovern
              in midfield, Mackay at the back,
              O'Hare up front. The skewer isn't it?
              In the shish kebab.

     CLOUGH watches MACKAY passing the ball, creating space..

                           CLOUGH
              It's beautiful. A thing of fucking
              beauty!!
     CLOUGH grabs TAYLOR's head, kisses him. OVER THIS: we fade in
     the roar from the crowd...

     SAM LONGSON, BRIAN CLOUGH, PETER TAYLOR and DAVE MACKAY are
     all celebrating with all their families.

     The trophy is centre-stage. CLOUGH sings a Sinatra classic..

                           CLOUGH
              "Love and marriage, love and marriage,
              it's an institute you can't
              disparage.."

     To everyone's amusement: CLOUGH sings to PETER TAYLOR, not
     his own wife..

                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              "Try, try, try to separate them, it's
              an illusion. Try, try, try and you
              will only come to this conclusion.."

     In another corner: MACKAY is amiably ribbing LONGSON..
                           MACKAY
              ..."the man's crocked", "older than
              time" "broken more bones than Evel
              Knievel?"

                           LONGSON
              All right, I admit it, I was wrong.

     LONGSON starts eating his trademark felt hat. Much cheering
     as he munches in disgust and swallows with difficulty.

     Suddenly, DAVE MACKAY looks up, sees the television. Calls
     for quiet!!

     ON TV: a live awards presentation. From London. DON REVIE is
     being presented with an award...

                           REVIE
              ..for Leeds to win the First Division
              title, and for me to be named as
              English Manager of the year...feels
              like a dream come true...

     CLOUGH watches. His expression changes. His eyes burn into
     REVIE's.

                           CLOUGH
              You enjoy it, Don. Go home, put your
              feet up and fucking enjoy it. There's
              a good lad. Because we'll be in the
              First Division next season. And we're
              going to have you!

     Loud CHEERS from LONGSON, TAYLOR, MACKAY and CLOUGH. OVER
     THIS: we fade in the sound of roaring...

            the cathedral of English football on a

            afternoon everyone, it's the Charity

            1974 season, and a first chance to get
            a look at Brian Clough's Leeds...

                         JOURNALIST
            Will you be supporting Leeds today,
            Don?

                         REVIE
            You'd expect nothing less having been
            their manager for 13 years. But the
            fact is I'm here today as manager of
            England...

                         JOURNALIST
            Do you have any advice to give your
            successor, Brian Clough, before his
            first game?
     A mischievous smile barely perceptible of REVIE's face..

                         REVIE
            Win. The people of Leeds are used to
            winning.

     CLOUGH with the LEEDS TEAM in the dressing-room before kick
     off. PLAYERS changing. The stink of Ralgex. PHYSIOS bandaging
     the injured. JIMMY GORDON massaging one or two players.

                         CLOUGH
            Right, the team for today is: Harvey
            in goal, Reaney, Cherry, Bremner,
            McQueen, Hunter, Lorimer, Clarke,
            Jordan, Giles, Gray.

     CLOUGH folds a piece of paper. A flicker of vulnerability.

                         CLOUGH (cont'd)
            Obviously all eyes will be on us to
            see how things have changed. Without
            Don. What might be different under me.
            Let's show them some of the things
            we've been working on. Our changes in
            attitude, too. Our new outlook. New
            discipline. New approach.

               Of course, it goes without saying I'd

      Silence. BREMNER continues to limber up...

                            CLOUGH (cont'd)
               You know, son, I've nothing but the
               highest regard for you as a player.

      They PLAYERS get the instruction to walk out, towards the
      roar of the crowd...

                            CLOUGH (cont'd)
               In fact, I wrote you a card saying as
               much. Did you not get it? From
               Majorca?

      The roar of the CROWD grows louder...

               this job. How much I thought we could
               achieve together. And inviting you and
               your family down to our place in Calla

                            BREMNER

      They walk out into the ROAR of the crowd....

            achievement for Derby, being promoted
            to the First Division, but the truth
            is Leeds United have an unfortunate
            habit of reminding them just how far
            they still have to go..

                         TAYLOR
            Arrogant twat..

                         CLOUGH
            But he's right. Five nothing. They
            made us look like fools today. And
            what was John O'Hare doing? Letting
            Madeley bully him like that.

              Push him around. Madeley's half his
              bloody size. O'Hare needs to toughen
              up. He's from Scottish dockyards,
              isn't he? And what about John
              McGovern? He was useless in the
              middle. Who's idea was that?

                            TAYLOR
              Yours.

                           CLOUGH
              He was all over the place. Like the
              Wandering Jew. Giving the ball to
              anyone BUT his own. We need a ball
              player, a natural in midfield. Who'll
              hold onto it. Keep possession. We're
              giving it away too easily.

                           TAYLOR
              Someone like Colin Todd.
                           CLOUGH
                     (sharp intake)
              Oooh, now you're talking. Lovely pair
              of feet.

                           TAYLOR
              I've heard he wants out of Sunderland,
              too. They're all jumping ship up
              there.

     CLOUGH thinks for a moment, then...

                           CLOUGH
              Well, go on then. Sign him.
                           TAYLOR
              What? We can't. Longson's already told
              us. Club's in debt.

                           CLOUGH
              Bollocks to that. I've not brought us
              all the way to the First Division just
              to sit there mid-table, and be cannon
              fodder for sides like Leeds. Sign the
              man.

                           TAYLOR
              Hang on, hang on, careful...

                           CLOUGH
              I'll handle bloody Longson.

                                                                              36


62   EXT. TRAINING GROUND - DERBY - DAY - (1972)                  62

     CLOUGH is working a session with the Derby PLAYERS. A car
     screeches into the car park behind. A red-faced, apoplectic
     SAM LONGSON gets out..

                         UNCLE SAM
            A hundred and seventy grand?!? For
            Colin fucking Todd?!?

                         CLOUGH
            Correction, the ALMIGHTY Colin Todd.
            The best technical footballer in the
            country.

                         UNCLE SAM
            A salary of three hundred quid a week?
            You can't pay a footballer that!!

                         CLOUGH
            That's the way things are going, Uncle
            Sam. Football's all about money now.

                         UNCLE SAM
            I told you never to go over my head
            again.

                         CLOUGH
            Had no choice. Windows opened up. You
            were in the bloody West Indies.

                         UNCLE SAM
            WindowS? You mean there were others?!?

                         CLOUGH
            Messrs. Gemmell and Hennessy.

     Two PLAYERS turn and wave to LONGSON..

                         GEMMELL/HENNESSY
            Afternoon!/Hello!

                         UNCLE SAM
                   (eyes popping/apoplectic)
            For fucks SAKE!

                         CLOUGH
            Let me ask you a question, Uncle Sam.
            What did you come into football for?

                         UNCLE SAM
            To support the football club in MY
            HOME TOWN. The club I've supported ALL
            MY LIFE.

                                                         (CO NTINU ED)

                                                                               37
62   CON TINUE D:                                                  62

                           CLOUGH
              Well, I'm sure we all admire your
              loyalty...

                           UNCLE SAM
              What I DIDN'T come into it for was to
              be lectured by a cocky little twat
              from the North East.

                           CLOUGH
              But the way I see it, there's no point
              being in this game unless you want to
              beat the best, and be the best, and
              that's all the people of Derby want.
              To see their team on top of the tree,
              Derby, Derby Uber Alles, and if it's
              really their interest you have at
              heart, not just impressing your
              friends in the Director's box, I
              suggest you keep your eyes on your
              road haulage business, keep your
              opinions to yourself and start signing
              some fucking cheques, there's a good
              lad. Leave the running of this
              football club to the professionals.

                           UNCLE SAM
              But professionals DON'T run the club,
              Brian, the Chairman does. And if it's
              true, that football is all about
              money, and that's the way it's going,
              that's suits us Chairmen just fucking
              fine..because we're the ones who've
              got it.
     SAM LONGSON lights a cigar, and walks off.


63   EXT. CAR PARK - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - (1972)                63

     The Leeds coach pulls into the Derby car park. Doors open.
     DON REVIE and SYD OWEN disembark.

     Followed by the Leeds PLAYERS. Smoking. Side-burns. Long-
     haired assassins one and all.


64   INT. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME - (1972)                            64

     CLOUGH and TAYLOR watch from an upstairs corridor window..

                           CLOUGH
              See they've driven all the way into
              the car park this time.

              It's not a cup game, is it?

     CLOUGH and TAYLOR look at one another, "Nutter".


65   INT. DRESSING-ROOM - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - (1972)           65

     An atmosphere of expectation and excitement.

     Outside, the sound of the crowd. The sound of tannoy
     announcements. CLOUGH goes to JOHN MCGOVERN..

                           CLOUGH
              You know what your job is today?

                           MCGOVERN
              Yes, Boss. Stay in position. Keep the
              shape. "Stop being the Wandering Jew".
                           CLOUGH
              Good lad. And enjoy it. You deserve
              to. You've worked hard this week.

     CLOUGH moves to JOHN O'HARE.

                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              Clear about what you're doing today?

                           O'HARE
              Be big. Be strong. Any chance I get,
              flatten Paul fucking Madely.

                           CLOUGH
              Good lad. He bullies you, you bully
              him back. And near post for the
              corners we worked on.

                           O'HARE
              Yes, Boss.

     CLOUGH moves to another PLAYER. (his new signing, COLIN TODD)

                           CLOUGH
              Understand what I want from you today,
              son?

                           TODD
                     (smiles)
              I should, Mr. Clough. It's simple
              enough.

              Go on, let's hear it.

                           TODD
              "To be Colin fucking Todd, the best
              technical footballer in the country."

     Laughter in the dressing-room.

                           CLOUGH
              There, how could you forget that? Now
              come on..
                     (clapping hands)
              Up and at `em!

     CLOUGH holds the door open, shaking each and every one of the
     PLAYERS' hands as they clatter out into the tunnel..


66   EXT. TOUCHLINE - DAY - (1972)                                 66
     CLOUGH sits in his dug-out. While JIMMY GORDON and TAYLOR are
     calling out instructions to the Derby players on the pitch...

     CLOUGH stares at REVIE and his lieutenants in their
     neighbouring dug-out.

     Presently...CLOUGH's view, and our frame is filled by two
     wheel-chairs carrying disabled/learning difficulties FANS
     wearing rosettes...

     The wheel-chair FAN looks at CLOUGH for a beat, then
     violently shakes a rattle...

                           WHEEL-CHAIR FAN
              COME ON LEEDS!!!!!

     CLOUGH's face: shocked. Then, all of a sudden....

     "RRRRROOOOOOOAAAAAARRRRRR", a roar goes up. Goal Leeds. REVIE
     and his henchmen leap to their feet, delighted. Applauding.

     The WHEEL-CHAIR FAN screams with delight. Makes a `wanker'
     gesture in CLOUGH's face.

     CLOUGH's face: darkening like thunder.


67   INT. DRESSING-ROOM - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - (1972)           67

     CAPTION: "HALF-TIME: DERBY 0, LEEDS 1"

     The DERBY PLAYERS sit in the dressing-room. Shaking.
     Terrified. Trying to hide, find shelter, find protection.

     Already fearing the rocket they will get, the lash of his
     tongue..

     Presently, the door opens, and CLOUGH walks in, carrying a
     bottle of brandy, Remy Martin.

                           CLOUGH
              Congratulations, lads! Beautiful! That
              was as perfect a half of terrible
              football as I've ever seen. The plan
              you've obviously been hatching to get
              me the sack has worked a treat, so you
              deserve a little celebration...

     CLOUGH pours brandy into a tea-cup, gives it to a PLAYER..

                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              You do want me to get the sack?

                          MCGOVERN
              No, Boss.

                           CLOUGH
              Then why the fuck did you give it to
              their most dangerous player, Johnny
              fucking Giles?

                           MCGOVERN
              I didn't see him.

     CLOUGH turns to another PLAYER, (JOHN O'HARE), pours him a
     shot of cognac...

                           CLOUGH
              You want me to get the sack, Mr
              O'Hare?

                          O'HARE
              No, Boss.

                           CLOUGH
              That open goal? Looked like a
              deliberate fucking miss to me. A miss
              to get your manager the sack.

     CLOUGH turns to a third PLAYER, (COLIN TODD), hands him a
     cup..

                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              You do want me to get the sack, Mr.

              No.

             No what?

                             TODD
             No, Boss.

                          CLOUGH
             The amount of bloody money I paid for
             you, I must have been out of my mind.
             You can't even keep on your feet.

                             TODD
             No, Boss.

     CLOUGH turns, and faces the room.

                          CLOUGH
             You've all done a terrific job of
             getting me the sack. So I'm not
             letting you out of here for the second
             half, until you've finished the
             bottle.

     The PLAYERS stare at one another, holding their drinks.

                             CLOUGH (cont'd)
             DRINK!!!

     The PLAYERS nervously down their drinks. CLOUGH exits..


68   INT. TUNNEL OUTSIDE DRESSING-ROOM - DAY - (1972)                  68

     CLOUGH walks out to see PETER TAYLOR and JIMMY GORDON waiting
     - who were listening through the door..
                          TAYLOR
             You can't do that!!

     CLOUGH winks...

                          CLOUGH
             Can't I? Just you fucking watch me!!

     CLOUGH storms off. PETER TAYLOR is left alone. Looks pale.
     Momentarily holds his chest...

                          JIMMY
             You all right?

     The Derby PLAYERS run out, belching, watched and encouraged
     by PETER TAYLOR...

     JIMMY GORDON emerges from the dressing-room, holding the
     empty bottle of Scotch...

                         JIMMY
                   (to TAYLOR)
            Where's he gone now?


70   INT. MANGER'S OFFICE - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - (1972)        70

     CLOUGH pacing in his office. Unable to watch. Like an
     expectant father.

     Presently the building reverberates with a large...
     RRRROOOAAAARRRRRRRRR.

     A goal. But scored by whom? Derby or Leeds?

     CLOUGH looks up at the clock. The clock on the wall shows
     it's 4.20.

     Visibly anxious, CLOUGH starts pacing again. Presently,
     another deafening...

     RRRRROOOOOAAAAARRRRRRR

     The building is almost brought to it's foundations..

     CLOUGH looks up. Desperate to know. Derby or Leeds?
     But it's only 4.35. Game still not over. Not by a long way.

     CLOUGH carries on pacing. Walks from one side of the room to
     the next. Left to right. Right to left.

     Then, another stadium-shaking..

     RRRRRROOOOOOAAAAAARRRRRR

     CLOUGH looks up at the clock. 4.55.

     This is intolerable. The game must be over now.

     CLOUGH cannot bear it a moment longer. He opens the door.

                                                                            43


71   INT. CORRIDORS - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - (1972)            71

     CLOUGH walks down a corridor. Then runs. Then checks himself.
     Slows down. Dignity. Dignity. But still walks as fast as he
     can.

     CLOUGH turns a corner to the dressing-rooms and the tunnel,
     then sees PETER TAYLOR up ahead entering the tunnel from the
     pitch with several Derby PLAYERS..

     CLOUGH stops. TAYLOR looks up. Sees CLOUGH. Their eyes meet.
     CLOUGH's eyes. TAYLOR's eyes.

     Words are not necessary. TAYLOR's smile says it all. CLOUGH
     runs towards TAYLOR. The two men embrace.

                          CLOUGH
            And..?

                          TAYLOR
            2-1!!!

                          CLOUGH
            Who scored?

                         TAYLOR
            O'Hare. A brace. Oh, Brian, you should
            have seen his first. Turns Bremner
            inside out, nutmegs Madeley for good
            measure. It was beautiful. You'd think
            he'd been born in Rio de Janeiro, not
            Aber-bloody-deen..

     CLOUGH and TAYLOR walk off down the corridor.
                         TAYLOR (cont'd)
            What made you go for the Brandy?

                         CLOUGH
            They were just nervous. Shitting
            themselves. You could tell.

                         TAYLOR
            You're a bloody genius. I tell you
            what, Bri - if we can beat this lot,
            we can go all the way.

                                                                               44

             Derby County winning the championship
             is a victory for decency, for honesty
             and for football. Because they don't
             pull shirts, or nudge people in the
             back in the box.

              If you ask me, the best thing for
              British football, the quickest way to
              clean it up, would be fore dirty sides
              like Leeds to be sent down for a spell
              in Division Two.

            I haven't personally heard Mr.
            Clough's comments, but they have been
            reported to me, and our solicitors are
            looking into them. If I could offer
            Mr. Clough some advice ...I think he'd
            be better off keeping his opinions to
            himself...some of these allegations
            against Leeds United and his fellow
            professionals are an absolute
            disgrace...

            Always a particular pleasure that.

            Brian, you've also done it on                                  
            comparatively small gates, which I                             
            know has niggled you a little bit                              
            during the season.

            Niggled me, David, it's absolutely                             
            made me blazing. To be honest, I know                          
            what I want to achieve, I know what                            
            the people of Derby want us to                                 
            achieve, but when you've got a                                 
            chairman not wanting to put his hand                           
            in his pocket...                                               

     MICHAEL PARKINSON, the highest rating talk show on TV..

                         CLOUGH (cont'd)                                   
            You ever see eighty five or perhaps                            
            ninety percent of chairmen talking -                           
            I'd love a few chairmen on your                                
            programme occasionally - I believe the                         
            very sight of them brings the game                             
            into disrepute (some clap in the                               
            audience). And every time they open                            
            their mouths it kills it. Because the                          
            very thing they've given me a lot of                           
            stick about over the years - about                             
            talking too much and going on                                  
            television too much, there are the                             
            very people who can put two words                              
            together and its rather embarrassing                           
            to me that a man - or men - can stop                           
            me talking to people like you. I love                          
            football. It's deep, it goes right                             
            down through. It's in every nerve,                             
            vein, you name it. It consumes me. And                         
            when I have to come and talk about I                           
            like the passions of football to come                          
            out. Because there are not enough in                           
            the game.

              bit of the truth. I accept without any

            "Boss, you're doing it wrong?"

                         CLOUGH (ON TV)
            I say, "How do you think it should be
            done?" We talk about it for twenty
            minutes, then we decide I was right.

     CLOUGH and TAYLOR, surrounded by FRIENDS and FAMILIES, with

     Watching the Mohammed Ali on television.

     They roar with laughter. Cheers and celebration. Everyone
     roughing up CLOUGH's hair, patting him on the back.

     A portrait of Her Majesty the Queen and HRH the Duke of Kent
     hangs on an oak-pannelled wall: the Patron and the President
     of the Football Association..

     Beneath the portrait: a long table in a boardroom. An austere
     six-man disciplinary committee of the FA. Blazers and
     buttons. Whiskers and power.

     Aldermen, Freemasons, Generals, white-hair and golden
     buttons. Admirals, Presidents and Vice-Presidents.

     Sitting in front of the committee...

     BILLY BREMNER and BRIAN CLOUGH. Like schoolchildren..

              William Bremner, your conduct in the
              Charity Shield match was deplorable
              and cannot be tolerated.

                            CLOUGH
              It was.

                           COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN
              We understand Leeds are taking
              disciplinary action against you
              internally, however the Football
              Association has to be seen to make an
              example. We have therefore decided to
              impose a fine of five hundred pounds..

     CLOUGH's face: a victorious look.

                            CLOUGH
              Thank you..
                           COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN
              ...and a suspension until September
              30th...

     "Bang", he brings down a gavel. CLOUGH's face: the smile
     fades..

                           CLOUGH
                     (disbelieving laugh)
              What? September 30th? That's more than
              a month? Thats six bloody weeks??

                           COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN
              I'll make it seven if you carry on
              with language like that..

                           CLOUGH
              C'mon, double the fine. Treble it.
              Anything. Don't suspend him for that
              long. He's my Captain. The best player
              I've got.

     The COMMITTEE MEMBERS get to their feet and walk out.

     outside. HIS players. DERBY players.

     To one side, MCGOVERN and O'HARE. CLOUGH looks out at them.
     He winks, discreetly at them. They look back, and nod.

     Then get back to work.
     The sound of laughter. The camaraderie of a family. What a
     contrast to Leeds.

     CLOUGH walks along a corridor with photos on the wall. Framed
     photos of HIS victories.

     HIS club. HIS family. HIS home.

            Well, look who it is! Come to raid my
            larder? Or just missing the place?

                           CLOUGH
              Cheeky sod! They're not worth a penny
              more than seventy.

              Having lost to Stoke and Birmingham..
                     (a beat)

              Give you a hundred grand.

              One thirty. Final offer.
     CLOUGH is about to explode, then..

                           CLOUGH
              All right. Done.

              enjoy? You?

                           CLOUGH
              Hey, it's `Boss' to you.

                           MACKAY
              Not any more.

                           CLOUGH
              I bought you when you were crocked,
              you fat bastard. And gave you the two
              best years of your career. It will
              always be `Boss' to you.

     CLOUGH walks to the door. He turns, and indicates the desk.

                            CLOUGH (cont'd)
               Ever tempted to burn that bloody desk?
               Chop it up and burn it?

                            MACKAY
               Why would I do that?

                            CLOUGH
               Exorcise the bloody place. Get rid of
               me.

                            MACKAY
               Why? You're not here anymore, are you?
               Be a waste of a perfectly good desk.

     It's late: JIMMY GORDON with CLOUGH in the bar..

                            JIMMY
               McGovern and O'Hare? Can't believe he
               actually sold them to you. It must be
               true, then..
                             CLOUGH
               What?

                            JIMMY
               The rumour that he's after buying
               Duncan Mackenzie. It's why he needs
               the money.

                            CLOUGH
               Who's Duncan Mackenzie?

     DUNCAN MACKENZIE, long-haired, chain-smoking, bemused, stands
     in the lobby of the hotel. OVER THIS: we hear...

                            CLOUGH (O.S.)
               Is that Duncan Mackenzie?

                            MACKENZIE (O.S.)
               Yes. This is he.

                            CLOUGH (O.S.)
               Now listen to me. You go get your coat
               and your skates on because you're
               coming to meet me at the Victoria

               And Duncan?
                            MACKENZIE (O.S.)
               Yes, Mr. Clough.

                            CLOUGH (O.S.)
               Bring a bloody pen, because you're
               signing for Leeds United today.

               Congratulations, lads!! My first
               signings for Leeds. My Leeds United.

     MACKENZIE lights a cigarette..

                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              We're going all the way, lads. Inter
              Milan, Barcelona. We're going to win
              silverware Don Revie could only dream
              of.

                           MCGOVERN/O'HARE
              Yes, Boss.

                           CLOUGH
              And you, Mr. Mackenzie, you scored
              twenty-eight goals last season. You'll
              score me twenty-nine goals this.

                           MACKENZIE
              Yes, Mr. Clough.

                           CLOUGH
              Do you know how many goals I scored
              before I got injured?

                           MACKENZIE
              I'm sorry, Mr. Clough. I don't.

                           CLOUGH
              Two hundred and fifty-one.

     MCGOVERN and O'HARE privately exchange looks, "Here goes".

                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              Do you know how many games it took me?

                           MACKENZIE
              I'm sorry, Mr. Clough, I don't.

                           CLOUGH
              Have a guess. Go on...

     O'HARE mouths "Two hundred and seventy-four"..

                           MACKENZIE
              Three hundred?

     MCGOVERN closes his eyes, "Moron."

             Two hundred and seventy-four! Now what
             do you think about that?

                          MACKENZIE
             Is that a record, Mr. Clough?

                          CLOUGH
                    (rolling eyes)
             `Course it's a bloody record.

     CLOUGH shoots a look to the others..

                          CLOUGH (cont'd)
             You know what ELSE you lot can do
             that's even more important? You can be
             my eyes and ears in that dressing
             room.

                          MACKENZIE/O'HARE
             Yes, Mr. Clough/Yes, Boss

                          CLOUGH
             Need to know what they say about me.
             Who's making trouble. Who the
             ringleaders are.

                          MACKENZIE
             Yes, Mr. Clough.

                          CLOUGH
             Want you to help me clear this place
             out. Make it MY team, understand. OUR
             team. Clean it up and clear it out
             once and for all.
                          MACKENZIE
             Yes, Mr. Clough.

     CLOUGH indicates MACKENZIE's drink..

     "Flash", photographs are being taken by PRESS of the three
     new signings, DUNCAN MCKENZIE, JOHN O'HARE and JOHN MCGOVERN,
     all wearing Leeds shirts.

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL: they are being watched from a distance
     by several Leeds SENIOR players..

97   INT. ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)                                   97

     CLOUGH walks through a corridor, brushing past JOHNNY GILES,
     BILLY BREMNER and several other SENIOR PLAYERS. An
     intimidating atmosphere..

                          BREMNER
             What the hell did you buy them for?
             Waste of bloody money.

                          CLOUGH
             Duncan Mackenzie scored twenty-eight
             goals last season. John O'Hare and
             John McGovern are both internationals.
                          GILES
             We've got two strikers, Alan Clarke
             and Mick Jones, they're
             internationals, too.

                          CLOUGH
             And one's injured and the other's
             fucking suspended.

                          BREMNER
             Maybe if you spent a little more time
             here on the training ground with us,
             you wouldn't need to buy Derby
             "rejects".

              I haven't forgotten.

                           GILES
              Well, you haven't told us a single
              thing about how QPR will play. Mr
              Revie would have files and dossiers
              prepared. Had the reserves playing the
              Rangers way all week. Had the first
              team looking out for this and that.

                           CLOUGH
              Bollocks to Mr. Revie! You're
              professional footballers. Stop Stan
              Bowles! That's all you need to know
              about QPR. And I don't have to justify
              myself to you. Not how or when I
              conduct training. Not who I buy or
              pick to play.
                           GILES
              No. Not to us. But come Saturday
              afternoon, there'll be 40,000 people
              here who you DO have to justify
              yourself, to.

     GILES, BREMNER et al walk off. CLOUGH left, staring.

     OVER THIS: a large RRRRROOOAAARRRR. GOAL.


98   INT. LEEDS DRESSING-ROOM - DAY - (1974)                       98

     The LEEDS PLAYERS trudge in, after the game. Angry. Heads
     hung low. Begin to strip off.
     CAPTION: "QPR 1, Leeds 0."

     CLOUGH enters. Visibly gutted by the result, but now's not
     the time to show it..

                             CLOUGH
              Sorry, lads.

     CLOUGH walks round the dressing-room, shaking hands
     individually, patting PLAYERS on the back...

                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              You were robbed out there today. Broad
              bloody daylight. That was never a

              Stan Bowles?    Diving like that? Man's
              a disgrace..

     But several of the LEEDS PLAYERS refuse his hand. Or freeze
     at his touch. Turn away from him..

                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              I've spoken to the referee already.
              Given him a piece of my mind. And come
              Monday morning, mark my word, I shall
              be taking this further...

     The LEEDS PLAYERS stare at one another. Shoot one another
     looks.

                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              Anyway, I want you all to know, I'm
              not in the slightest bit critical of
              your performance today. Not a bit of
              it. You were terrific out there...

      NORMAN HUNTER spits in contempt. GILES turns and walks out,
      into the showers.

                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              I couldn't ask for more effort.
              Commitment.
                     (tailing off)
              Passion.

      The LEEDS PLAYERS follow. Finally O'HARE and MCGOVERN, too.

      A deathly silence. CLOUGH is left alone in the dressing-room.

      OVER THIS: the sound of a ringing telephone. A gruff VOICE
      answers..

                              REVIE (V.O.)
              Hello?

98A   INT. CLOUGH'S ROOM - DRAGONARA HOTEL - NIGHT                  98A

      It's the middle of the night. CLOUGH speaks into the phone,
      visibly the worse for wear from alcohol...

                           CLOUGH (V.O.)
              You must be loving this. Loving every
              minute.


98B   INT. REVIE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT - (1974)                 98B

      DON REVIE's face, half-asleep. Visibly irritated. He sits up
      in bed. A stout Yorkshire matron wakes beside him.
                              REVIE
              Who is this?

                           CLOUGH
              Watching it all fall apart. It's Brian
              Clough.

                              REVIE
              What?

                           CLOUGH
              They won't play for me. Your boys.
              Your bastard sons. And never will.

                           REVIE
              Are you drunk, man? It's two in the
              morning. What do you want? Why are you
              ringing me here?

                                                                               57A

                             CLOUGH
                They're loyal to you. Thought you'd
                like to know that. Loyal to Big Daddy
                Don..

                             REVIE
                For God's sake go to sleep. Where's
                you dignity, man? And don't call here
                again.

      "Click", REVIE hangs up. CLOUGH stares at the receiver.

100   EXT. CAR PARK - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - (1973)                100

      The Leeds Coach arrives at Derby. Hydraulic brakes
      hissssssss. Doors open. Boots, shoes, walk down steps.

      DON REVIE, SYD OWEN and the Leeds PLAYERS disembark.

      HARVEY, REANEY, CHERRY, BREMNER, HUNTER, LORMIER, CLARKE,
      JORDAN, GILES, GRAY walk towards the Derby dressing-rooms..


101   INT. BOARDROOM - BASEBALL GROUND - SAME TIME - (1973)         101

      SAM LONGSON stands by the window, looking out into the car
      park. He sees the Leeds United PLAYERS. Reads their mood.

      Their faces. Their focus. Their murderous intent.

      A flicker of concern on SAM LONGSON's face. He thinks, then
      calls out to his SECRETARY..

                            LONGSON
               Get me today's team sheet, will you?

      He lets the curtain fall..


102   INT. CORRIDOR - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - (1973)                102

      SAM LONGSON walks through corridors of Elland Road, carrying
      the team sheet. Walking towards the dressing-rooms. He turns
      a corner and runs into CLOUGH..

                            CLOUGH
               What's up, Uncle Sam? Bit below stairs
               for you here, isn't it? Taken a wrong
               turn somewhere?

                            LONGSON
               Just seen the team sheet. Hinton,
               O'Hare, Todd, Mackay.
                      (looks left and right)
               That's our strongest side.

                            CLOUGH
               Of course it's our strongest side.
               It's Leeds United. Would you prefer I
               sent out the apprentices?

                            LONGSON
               We're at Juventus mid-week. Semi-final
               of the European Cup. Biggest night in
               the club's history!! Couldn't you just
               field...

                            CLOUGH
               What?

                            LONGSON
               Y'know...

                            CLOUGH
               A weaker side? Am I hearing right? Is
               the CHAIRMAN of this football club
               seriously asking his manager to LOSE?

                            LONGSON
               You know what I mean..

                            CLOUGH
               Against their biggest rivals?

102   CON TINUE D:                                               102

                            LONGSON
               The Chairman of this football club is
               asking his manager to be pragmatic.
               Manage his resources. Prioritise.
               We've embarked on a huge program of
               refurbishment and improvements. New
               stands. Better floodlights. We need a
               good run in Europe to pay for it.

                            CLOUGH
               I'm going to pretend I didn't hear a
               word of this.

      CLOUGH turns to walk away. LONGSON calls after him..

                            LONGSON
                      (checking watch)
               We've still got twenty minutes before
               kick-off. I'd reconsider if I were
               you. I wouldn't want my employer to be
               unhappy..

                              CLOUGH
               My employer?

                            LONGSON
               Chairman of Derby County. And Chairman
               LONG before you ever showed up.

                            CLOUGH
               That's right. You were Chairman of
               Derby County before I came here. I
               remember that. When Derby County were
               at the fucking foot of the Second
               Division, when nobody had heard of
               them for twenty years and nobody had
               heard of Sam bloody Longson ever. Full
               stop. And that's where you'd still
               fucking be if it wasn't for me; at the
               foot of the bloody Second Division,
               where nobody remembered you and nobody
               had heard of you. There would BE no
               Derby County without me, no league
               title, no Champions of England; not
               without Brian Clough.

      A door opens and PETER TAYLOR walks out in time to hear...

                            LONGSON
               I'm going to give you some good
               advice, Brian Clough.

              No matter how good you think you are,
              or how clever, or how many fancy new
              friends you make on the telly, the
              reality of footballing life is this:
              the Chairman is the boss, then come
              the directors, then the secretary,
              then the fans, then the players, and
              finally, last of all, bottom-of-the-
              heap, lowest of the low, the one in
              the end we can all without, is the
              bloody manager.

      LONGSON turns and storms off. TAYLOR looks at CLOUGH..

                           TAYLOR
              What have you done now?

      CLOUGH doesn't answer, and storms off in the opposite
      direction. TAYLOR is left alone, visibly anxious.

103   EXT. PITCH - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - (1973)                103

      CLOUGH watches from the touch-line as the game is in
      progress. "CRASH", a Leeds PLAYER scythes into a Derby
      PLAYER. "BEEEP", the referee blows his whistle. CLOUGH and
      leaps off his bench in fury. Shouting abuse..

                           CLOUGH
              You're a bloody disgrace! You should
              be in the book for that, Cherry!

      "BEEEP", the referee blows his whistle. REVIE smiles to
      himself as a Derby PLAYER is carried off on a stretcher.
                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              You're an animal. A fucking animal,
              Hunter!

      SAM LONGSON watches from the director's box. He closes his
      eyes. PETER TAYLOR witnesses this..

      "CRUNCH", another brutal tackle, another whistle. Another
      Derby PLAYER hobbles off the pitch. Blood streaming from a
      cut to his head..

                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              I'll see you in fucking court,
              Lorimer!

      CLOUGH's eyes meet REVIE's eyes along the touchline.

                                                                             60A


104   EXT. PITCH - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - (1973)                 104

      Afterwards: the LEEDS and DERBY players file off the pitch.
      BREMNER brushes roughly past CLOUGH...

                      (under his breath)
               Good luck in Europe..

      CLOUGH turns, `What?" BREMNER, GILES, HUNTER, LORIMER carries
      on walking down the tunnel. Laughing to themselves..

      CLOUGH is joined by TAYLOR and JIMMY GORDON.


105   INT. DERBY DRESSING-ROOM - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - (1973) 105

      Afterwards: the Derby dressing-room looks like the Emergency
      Room at a hospital..

      Casualties. Blood. Stitches. Swellings. At least half-a-dozen
      PLAYERS are injured. Some on stretchers.

      CLOUGH stares in horror at the wreckage from the doorway. SAM
      LONGSON appears beside him. Stares at CLOUGH..
                            LONGSON
               You fucking idiot.

      LONGSON turns and walks away. CLOUGH turns to survey the
      carnage in the dressing-room. Like a battlefield.

      CLOUGH's eyes meet TAYLOR's.

      REPORTER.

                            CLOUGH (ON TV)
               Disappointed? Not a bit. My players
               were heroic out there tonight.
               Effectively we were playing the
               Italian champions with a reserve team.
               That many of our first team are
               injured...

      CLOUGH continues. PETER TAYLOR stands beside him, visibly
      pale, stressed...
                            CLOUGH
               ...it's what happens if you have a
               Chairman who authorizes a multi-
               million pound refurbishment of the
               director's box and hospitality suites
               before he pays for a proper squad.
               Suppose it depends on your priorities.
               Players or prawn sandwiches? I know
               which I'd prefer. I know which honest,
               working class Derby supporters would
               prefer, too..

      A commotion breaks out. TV JOURNALISTS ask questions, sensing
      a great story. CLOUGH continues answering as, beside him,
      (unseen by anyone else)...
      ...TAYLOR is white-faced, holding his chest.

      This falls to MACKENZIE, who knocks back his drink. Trembling
      hands. Dutch courage.

                            MACKENZIE
               That you're never here.
                      (a beat)
               That they're worried about the future.
                      (a beat)

                              CLOUGH
              The bingo?
                           MCGOVERN

                           MCGOVERN

      CLOUGH stares, lost in thought: the three PLAYERS go. The
      door closes. CLOUGH is left alone.

      Then he gets up, and in a terrifying flash of rage, picks up
      his glass and throws it against the wall..

      CLOUGH sees BREMNER, GILES and HUNTER trying out the sports

      CLOUGH's car pulls up outside his house in Derby. He closes
      his eyes. Breathes a private sigh of relief. Home. At last.

      Safe. Surrounded by people who love him.

                                                                             65A

      but the youngest says, `Dad?'

                You still awake? You should be asleep.

                            CLOUGH
               A joke? All right. There's this bloke
               walking about in London, when all of a
               sudden, the city gets hit by a Russian
               `A' bomb. Booooooooom.

      CLOUGH sits down, strokes his son's head..

                            CLOUGH (cont'd)
               And all the buildings have fallen
               down. And all the people are dead. And
               now this bloke is the only man left in
               the whole of London.

      CLOUGH continues stroking his son's hair..

                            CLOUGH (cont'd)
               And he suddenly feels very, very
               lonely because there's no one else to
               talk to. Nobody else but him.
      CLOUGH's SON falls asleep. CLOUGH doesn't notice..

                            CLOUGH (cont'd)
               So he decides that he's had enough,
               that he can't bear being this lonely,
               and so he climbs up to the top of the
               one building still standing. The Post
               Office Tower. And then he jumps off.
               And he's falling down, down and down
               and down, the sixteenth floor, the
               fifteenth floor, the fourteenth, and
               that's when he hears the phone
               ringing...
      CLOUGH looks down. And gets two unexpected shocks.

      The first is that his SON is already asleep. The second is,
      there is a tear running down his own cheek.

      CLOUGH walks along the corridor. Past the photographs on the
      wall. The trophies in the cabinets. The pictures of a smiling
      DON REVIE - mocking him.

      CLOUGH shoots his cuffs. Rolls his neck. A boxer on his way
      to the ring. A gladiator on his way to the circus.

      He knocks on the door, and walks in. MANNY CUSSINS, SAM
      BOLTON and a third man. A stranger.

                          BOLTON
             About bloody time.

                          CUSSINS
             Where you been? I was about to send
             out a search party.

                          CLOUGH
             Look, Mr. Cussins, I know it's not
             been the best of starts, but in my
             defence, there are a couple of things
             I'd like to say...

                          CUSSINS
             This is Martin Hughes. He runs
             Mercedes here in the North.

                           CLOUGH
                     (double-takes)
             What?

                          CUSSINS
             We hear that's what you like to drive.
             A Mercedes?

                          CLOUGH
             It's..what I used to drive at Derby.
             Yes.

                          CUSSINS
             Well, we can't have Leeds United being
             outdone by Derby County, can we? So
             Martin here is going to take you over
             to his showroom and get you sorted
             out.

      They begin to walk to the door. CUSSINS puts his arm round
      CLOUGH...

                be a little more bloody lenient with

                off, as you can imagine - being denied
                what's rightfully theirs.

                Especially not Billy bloody Bremner.

              Clough will be met with instant
              dismissal."
                           TAYLOR
              Well, I hope you take notice. And act
              accordingly.

                           CLOUGH
              Would you like to hear my contrite
              reply?

      CLOUGH pulls out a letter..

                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              "Due to the complete breakdown in
              communication with the chairman, Peter
              Taylor and I find it is impossible to
              continue our good work for Derby
              County. We therefore wish to tender
              our resignations with immediate
              effect."

                           TAYLOR
                     (horrified)
              WHAT??!?

                           CLOUGH
              What do you think?

                           TAYLOR
              I don't want to resign.

                                                                                 71
118    CON TINUE D: (3)                                           118

                            CLOUGH
               No. Nor do I. Don't worry, they'll
               never let us. We just won them the
               championship. But it will strengthen
               our position and force them to get rid
               of Longson.

                            TAYLOR
               What? Oh, no, Brian. They'll never do
               THAT. He's Chairman.

                            CLOUGH
               I can't do it, Pete. I can't work with
               my hands tied, a Chairman telling me
               what I can or cannot do.

                            TAYLOR
               You're picking the wrong enemy. The
               enemy's not Longson. It's Revie. And
               your obsession with Leeds.
                            CLOUGH
               Don't be daft. We won the league,
               Pete. We're top dogs in Derby now. And
               Longson can't stand it. That's the
               problem.

                            TAYLOR
               No, it's not. It's YOU. This monster
               in you. This mad ambition. It comes
               and goes. Sometimes it's good...a
               fire, that stirs everything up, and
               then there's this...this thing that
               takes you over...and destroys
               everything that is good in your life.
       TAYLOR's face...

                            TAYLOR (cont'd)
               Please tell me this letter is just a
               draft. You haven't sent it. Because
               I'll be out in a couple of days...let
               me talk to them.


118A   INT. CORRIDOR - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY                     118A

       "Crash", door fly open. CLOUGH storms down a corridor.

                                                                               72


119   INT. BOARDROOM - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY                       119

      "Bang", CLOUGH crashes into the boardroom. When they see
      CLOUGH, voices fall silent. They stiffen..

                          CLOUGH
             What are you doing? You weren't
             supposed to accept our resignations.

                          LONGSON
             `Shouldn't bloody well offer them,
             then.

      CLOUGH turns to the other DIRECTORS...

                          CLOUGH
             I only did because of HIM!
                    (points at LONGSON)
             You can't get rid of us. It'd be a
             disaster for the club. For the whole
             of Derby.

                          LONGSON
             You can't keep shooting your mouth off
             the way you have been...or issuing
             these ultimatums..

      The board stare at one another, avoid eye contact..

                          LONGSON (cont'd)
             With great reluctance your
             resignations have been accepted.

                          CLOUGH
             You can't do this! It's madness!
                          LONGSON
             The decision stands. And don't even
             think of a settlement. You're getting
             nowt.

                          CLOUGH
             We're going to create a footballing
             dynasty here. Derby could be one of
             the greats alongside United,
             Liverpool, Leeds..

      CLOUGH stands in the middle of the room. Speechless.

                          LONGSON
             Car keys on the table and out!

      CLOUGH stares in disbelief at the other BOARD MEMBERS..

                              LONGSON

                 again!

       CLOUGH stares in disbelief at the assembled board members of
       Derby County..

       ROY KIRKLAND, ROBERTSON-KING, KEELING, SAM LONGSON, et al.
       Blazers and brass buttons. The sound of clearing throats..

122   INT. CLOUGH HOUSE - DERBY - NIGHT - (1973)                   122

      TAYLOR walks through the open door.

      A meeting is underway in the CLOUGH house.

      In the hall: CLOUGH's three CHILDREN stare through banister
      railings..

      The smoke-filled front room is packed with FRIENDS,
      RELATIVES, LAWYERS, DERBY COUNTY CLUB EMPLOYEES..

      Newspapers are strewn over the table. CLOUGH sits in the
      corner, being given counsel by SOLICITORS. JIMMY GORDON reads
      out a letter from the DERBY PLAYERS...

                          JIMMY
             "To the directors of Derby County
             Football Club. We, the undersigned
             players, are unanimous in our support
             and respect for Mr. Clough and Mr.
             Taylor and ask that they be reinstated
             as manager and assistant manager of
             the club."

      Cheers and celebrations. CLOUGH is congratulated. Handshakes.
      Hair ruffled..

                          JIMMY (cont'd)
             "Signed by John O'Hare, Roy
             MacFarland, Colin Todd, Archie
             Gemmill, Kevin Hector, Alan Hinton.."

                          TAYLOR
             But not Dave Mackay.

      Silence. All voices stop. Heads turn.

                            TAYLOR (cont'd)
               Who's just accepted the job.

      Deathly silence. The crowds part. CLOUGH sits up, and
      stares..

                            CLOUGH
               What? Dave MACKAY?

                            TAYLOR
               It's in the evening paper.

                            CLOUGH
               I signed that fat fuck - saved his
               professional life. Gave him two more
               years as a player, as my captain. Dave
               Mackay?
                      (a beat)
               He wouldn't fucking DARE!

      CLOUGH sees the paper. "MACKAY TO BE DERBY MANAGER". CLOUGH's
      face. Devastated.

                            TAYLOR
               Why did you do it? I love this place,
               Brian. I'm happy here. So are you.

                            CLOUGH
               It's not over yet, Pete. The lawyers
               are issuing a writ tomorrow. Against
               Longson. The players are calling a
               meeting. There's talk of them coming
               out on strike. There's protest marches
               scheduled for this week-end.

                            TAYLOR
               Why couldn't you just have kept your
               mouth shut? We'll never find anywhere
               like this again.

      TAYLOR stares. Worried. At that moment, BARBARA sticks her
      head outside.

                            BARBARA
                      (holding phone)
               Mike Bamber on the phone?

                            CLOUGH
               Who's Mike Bamber??

                            TAYLOR

124   EXT. DUGOUT - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)                     124

      With a loud ROAR the game against Luton gets under way.

      CLOUGH takes his seat alone in the dugout. Unseen by him, in
      the stands behind him...

      DON REVIE arrives, shaking hands, taking a seat.

      Immediately, as soon as they see REVIE, the LEEDS FANS start
      cheering, "There's only one Don Revie.."

      CLOUGH turns, to see REVIE. Waving back. Acknowledging the
      crowd.

      The LEEDS FANS chant, "There's only one Don Revie!"

      In the directors' box, MANNY CUSSINS notes the reaction of
      the crowd.

      In the press boxes, the JOURNALISTS and TV COMMENTATORS also
      note the reaction of the crowd...

      CLOUGH's face: stinging with humiliation. And as if that
      weren't bad enough...

      "RRROOOOAAARRRRR", Luton score a goal.

      In the director's box: MANNY CUSSINS' face..


125   INT. TUNNEL - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)                     125

      Afterwards: CLOUGH and the PLAYERS walk down the tunnel to
      see MANNY CUSSINS and SAM BOLTON waiting. Grim-faced.

                            CUSSINS
               Players Lounge, Brian. Ten minutes.

      CLOUGH opens his mouth, is about to reply, but CUSSINS has
      turned and walked away.


126   INT. PLAYERS' LOUNGE - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)            126

      CLOUGH walks in as several players walk in, too. CLOUGH takes
      a seat. CUSSINS calls for quiet...

                            CUSSINS
               This is the worst start to a season
               Leeds has had in twenty years. Four
               points from five games? Second from
               fucking bottom? What's going on? As
               far as I can I see, there's no
               relationship, no understanding between
               players and management. Not a healthy
               one, anyway.

      PLAYERS heads low. Avoiding CLOUGH's eyes.

                            BREMNER
               Perhaps if Mr. Clough were to step
               outside, we would all feel a little
               more like speaking our minds.

      CLOUGH can't help smiling..

                            CLOUGH
                      (under his breath)
               You bastard.

      Of course, CUSSINS will reprimand him. Refuse his request.
      CUSSINS looks at WOODWARD and BOLTON. Then..

126   CON TINUE D:                                                126

                            CUSSINS
               All right. If you wouldn't mind,
               Brian? Just for a minute or two?

      CLOUGH cannot believe his ears. What?? He gets to his feet.

                              CLOUGH
               As you wish.

      CLOUGH walks out of the room. DUNCAN MACKENZIE watches.
      Visibly shocked.


127   INT. CORRIDOR - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974                    127

      CLOUGH closes the door behind him. He stands in the corridor
      outside. From inside, we hear..

                            BREMNER (O.S.)
               No one likes him. The atmosphere in
               the dressing-room is non-existent.
               We're not allowed to mention Mr.
               Revie's name...

                            GILES (O.S.)
               He's banned us from doing all the
               things we used to do...like playing
               bingo and carpet bowls...

                            BREMNER (O.S.)
               Tactically, he's never prepared, never
               tells us how he wants us to play...

                            HUNTER (O.S.)
               You know he's just itching to bring in
               a whole lot of new players..

      CLOUGH looks out of the window to see DON REVIE signing
      autographs, shaking hands with adoring LEEDS FANS outside..

                            VOICE
               What's going on?

      CLOUGH turns to see JIMMY GORDON..

               The last two words of every story ever
               written is what's going on. "The
               fucking end."

               What I want to know is why, after all
               the thing he's said about us, did you
               appoint him in the first place?

                            CLOUGH
               I'm about to go home and work out how
               much I want in severance pay. Don't
               worry, I'll make sure your job is
               safe.

                            JIMMY
               I'm not staying here without you. No
               bloody way.

                            CLOUGH
               Then I suggest you go home and do the
               same.

                            BREMNER (O.S.)
               What me and the lads are trying to
               say, Mr. Cussins, is that compared to
               Mr. Revie - he's just not good
               enough...

      CLOUGH: a dagger in his heart..

                           CLOUGH
               Come on.

      CLOUGH turns, leading JIMMY GORDON away, then he stops.
      Having seen something through a window..

      Outside: DON REVIE walks down into the car park and towards
      his car - cheered and clapped every step of the way by LEEDS
      FANS..

      The Messiah of West Yorkshire...

      He and PETER TAYLOR get out on a road overlooking the sea..

      CLOUGH looks around at his surroundings. The OLD PEOPLE. The

              Brighton and Hove Albion? Have you
              seen where they are? Bottom of the
              third division.

                           TAYLOR
              And we can get them out of there. Like
              that. We did it with Hartlepools. We
              did it with Derby.

                           CLOUGH
              We cared about Hartlepools and Derby.
              We're from the North, Pete. What do we
              care about Brighton? Bloody
              Southerners. Look where we are. We're
              almost in France.

                           TAYLOR
              Hey, they've got money, this lot. And
              ambition. And get a lungful of that
              air. It'd be good for my health.

                           CLOUGH
              You can't manage a team that's not
              your own people. Not what you know.
              Anyway the Protest Movement in Derby
              is still in full flow. We could still
              get our jobs back.

                           TAYLOR
              No, we won't. It's over, Brian.
              They'll never take us back. Not now.

                           CLOUGH
              What about proper clubs? Like
              Manchester United? Or Spurs? Or
              England, now Alf's gone. Wouldn't you
              fancy that?

                           TAYLOR
              No one's rung, have they? You've
              scared them all off.

                           CLOUGH
              It's only been a couple of weeks.

                           TAYLOR
              C'mon. Just listen to them? Please?
              For me?

               seven grand. Each.

                            TAYLOR
               Seven grand? Y'hear that, Brian?

                            BAMBER
               Plus a salary that exceeds by twenty
               percent what Derby were paying you.

                            TAYLOR
               Very generous, Mike. Terrific.

                            CLOUGH
               But those are first division wages.

                            BAMBER
               First division's where I want this
               club to be.
                            CLOUGH
               Are you sure you can afford it?

                            BAMBER
               Are you sure you're worth it?

                             CLOUGH
               Cheeky sod.

      BAMBER offers his hand. CLOUGH stares at it..

                            CLOUGH (cont'd)
               We're going to need a holiday first.
                            BAMBER
               Take as long as you like.

                            CLOUGH
               Two weeks. Somewhere hot. On you.

      BAMBER doesn't even flinch. Smiles..

                            BAMBER
               I'll even throw in the bloody trunks.

      CLOUGH and BAMBER shake. TAYLOR beams with delight. OVER
      THIS: we fade in the sound of classical Spanish guitar..

                          TAYLOR
             But we've given Brighton our word. And

             else has offered us a better one..and
             not just anyone. The best team in the
             country. C'mon, Pete, you know what
             that means.. It'd be the Charity
             Shield at Wembley in a months time.
             The European Cup after..

                          TAYLOR
             Yes, but even if we won them it would                        
             always be Revie's achievements. HIS
             team..

             What? And you'd sooner fester down
             there? With all those fucking Tories?
             In that blue-rinse retirement home by

             Fucking midgets.

                          TAYLOR
             But at least we'd be together, you and
             me. We could build them up. Make them
             our own. Like we did with Hartlepools.
             Like we did with Derby.

                          CLOUGH
             And then what? Bottle again as soon as
             it comes to the big time. That's
             always been the trouble with you,
             Pete. No ambition.

                          TAYLOR
             And that's the trouble with you. Too
             much ambition. Too much greed. Too
             much everything.

                          CLOUGH
             You knock it, but it's done you proud
             over the years. My "ambition". Without
             me - you'd still be stuck in Burton
             Albion. On the arse of the footballing
             earth.
                          TAYLOR
             But without you I'd still have a job                          
             in Derby. A job and a home that I
             love.

             Yes, Brian - you're the shop window,
             I'll grant you that. The razzle and
             the bloody dazzle. But I'm the goods
             at the back. And without me, without                          
             someone to save you from yourself,
             you're not just half..

             it?

                          CLOUGH
             What's not working? I haven't been
             here five minutes, so how can anything
             be working yet?

                          CUSSINS
             Still...the players aren't happy.
             We're not happy.

                          CLOUGH
             So what do you want to do about it?
                          CUSSINS
             If it's not working, then we'll have
             to part company.

                          CLOUGH
             Fine. It'll cost you twenty-five
             grand.

      The Leeds BOARD MEMBERS choke...

                          CUSSINS
             What? For six weeks work?

                          CLOUGH
             Plus three and a half grand for Jimmy
             Gordon. And an agreement that Leeds
             United will pay both our income taxes
             for the next three years.

                          CUSSINS
             That's bloody criminal.

                          CLOUGH
             No, what's criminal, Mr. Cussins, is
             the way you as Chairman asked me to
             leave the room like that in front of
             the players. Your MANAGER. Going
             behind my back like that.

             I admit, that was wrong.

141   INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE - DAY - (1974)                          141

      CLOUGH and his SONS are packing together CLOUGH's belongings
      in a couple of boxes. A knock at the door..

      DUNCAN MACKENZIE comes in, in track suit, a cigarette in
      hand. Ready for the day's training..

                            MACKENZIE
               Just wanted to say, it's not right.
               They should have given you more time.
                            CLOUGH
               Good lad.

                            MACKENZIE
               Not just me that feels that way,
               either.

                            CLOUGH
               The sad thing is, it won't work. You
               can't change a manager like a pair of
               socks. It'll happen once, to me - and
               never again.

      CLOUGH shakes CLARKE's hand.

      `Rrrrinng', the phone rings. CLOUGH turns and picks up the
      phone. He listens, then..

      CLOUGH sits in make-up. The door opens and AUSTIN MITCHELL,
      the same presenter as earlier, sticks his head round the
      corner..

      chatting to the SOUND MAN.

      CLOUGH's microphone is fixed, he is shown to his seat beside

      corner, in conspiratorial conversation, and out to the
      seats..

      It's a set-up! CLOUGH looks over at AUSTIN MITCHELL and the
      crew, who shiftily avoids CLOUGH's eyes..

      Suddenly, the theme music plays, the FLOOR MANAGER counts
      down..

               Five, four, three..
      The PRESENTER looks up..

                            MITCHELL
               Good evening. Tonight the football
               world was stunned by the news that
               Brian Clough has been sacked as
               manager of Leeds United. We'll be
               talking not just to Brian Clough, but
               also to the man he replaced, who's
               success he couldn't emulate, Don
               Revie.

      MITCHELL turns to CLOUGH..

                            MITCHELL (cont'd)
               To Brian Clough first of all. What's
               your reaction to being sacked in this
               fashion?

                            CLOUGH
               Obviously, Austin, my initial reaction
               is one of shock at finding myself here
               with Revie...

                            REVIE
               See? Not so easy to make accusations
               when it's to someone's face...

                            CLOUGH
               ...but in answer to your question, six
               weeks is hardly a long time to be
               given a chance in any job. I would
               hope Revie would get a lot longer time
               in his.

             Do you consider it was possible to
             step into your shoes, Don Revie? To
             replace you?

                          REVIE
             Being very, very honest, I think it
             was a difficult job for anyone to do.
             But I do feel Brian Clough, I won't
             call him Clough because I won't take
             him down like that..

                           CLOUGH
             Thank you.

              That's not true. The last four
              seasons, we've topped the charts for
              entertaining football.

              And before that, you also topped ALL

              have been docked points and sent DOWN

              And in fact, you went on record and
              said so, Brian Clough. Again and
              again. That Leeds should, in fact, be
              relegated.

                           CLOUGH
              And I was right.

                           MITCHELL
              Do you think that might have hurt your
              chances of success when you then came
              to manage them?

                           REVIE
              Of course it did! The things he said?
              Why, man? Why did you take the job in
              the first place?

                           CLOUGH
              Because I thought it was the best job
              in the country.

                           REVIE
              Of course it was the best job in the
              country.

              Champions.

             Listening to you, I am struck that
             this is not just a business matter for
             you both. It's more than that. It's
             personal. Am I right?

                          CLOUGH
             Well, we're very different people, Don
             and I. We have different styles. In
             football and in life. I'm a warm man.
             An idealist. I do believe in faeries,
             and that is my outlook. Don is
             different. There's a hardness to him.
             A hardness. Maybe he's not even aware
             of it. But he's a cold person.

              And that lack of warmth. That coldness
              was there. Permeated the club when I
              arrived.

                           REVIE
              I totally refute that. The atmosphere
              at Leeds was like a family. A happy
              family. You ask any of my players. I
              signed most of them personally. Knew
              their backgrounds. Their parents.
              Their streets. I was a father to them.
              In that club every morning. Massaging
              those boys. Did you do that for them?

                           CLOUGH
              They would never have let me.

                           REVIE
              Did you try? You didn't even try. I
              soaped those boys down with my own
              hands. You just went to Leeds with no
              thought for the club, no thought for
              the players. Just on some kind of mad
              personal vendetta with me.

                           CLOUGH
              Well are you surprised? What else was
              I going to do?? After what you did...

              4th March 1968. See? I even remember
              the date. You came to Derby County,
              the third round of the FA Cup, and you
              refused to shake my hand.

              Never! Matter of principle! I always
              shake the other manager's hand!

              You shook Peter Taylor's hand, and my
              trainer, Jimmy Gordon's.

              No, you saw me Don. But considered me
              beneath you. Looked down on me. And
              dismissed me. Just like you did every
              other club and every other manager in
              the country.

      CLOUGH standing in the gate to his house..

      TAYLOR looks at CLOUGH. Their eyes meet. A poignant moment.

                          TAYLOR
             They've kicked you out, already?

                           CLOUGH
             They have.

                          TAYLOR
             So how long was that?

                          CLOUGH
             Forty-four days.

                           TAYLOR

      TAYLOR strains not to show his satisfaction..

                          TAYLOR (cont'd)
             So what are you doing here?

             Pete...you know why I'm here...and I
             won't bloody grovel.

      TAYLOR shrugs, "Please yourself". Turns and starts walking
      inside.

             All right. I'm grovelling. I'm on my
             knees.

      TAYLOR turns. Sees CLOUGH on his knees. Begging for
      forgiveness.

             "I apologize unreservedly for being a

      arms, and the two MEN fall into an embrace.
      But in the clench, TAYLOR's smile fades, his expression
      suddenly becoming serious.

      TAYLOR holds CLOUGH tight, and whispers...

                            TAYLOR
               You'll only fuck me up again, won't
               you?

                            CLOUGH
               I love you, y'know.

                            TAYLOR
               I know. But it won't stop you.

      A beat. CLOUGH thinks, then..

149   CON TINUE D: (2)                                           149

                          CLOUGH
             So? Would you sooner go through it all
             without me?

      TAYLOR's face: freeing and condemning himself at once..

                           TAYLOR
             Never.

      Our CAMERA slowly pulls back: over the Brighton landscape, as
      CLOUGH and TAYLOR disappear into TAYLOR's house..
