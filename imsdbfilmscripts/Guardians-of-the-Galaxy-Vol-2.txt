          OVERHEAD SHOT: A `79 Cobra winds alongside the Missouri
          River, past swaying loosestrife, vibrant sugar maples, and
          oily self-pump gas stations. A hazy sun glints off the hood
          of the Cobra which, like its descendant the Milano, is orange
          and teal.
                         
          We MOVE DOWN AND IN on a fresh-faced girl of 18 in the
          passenger seat: MEREDITH QUILL. As "Brandy" blasts from the

          mouth, and sings along, out-of-tune -

          Meredith LAUGHS too. She SINGS and dances with abandon in
          her seat. She's a lively goofball, and it's apparent where
          Peter Quill received much of his personality.

          The Mysterious Man looks proudly at Meredith. With a
          perpetually excited glint in his eye, and the air of a self-

          A PERCUSSIVE BOMB at the feet of the Ravagers BURSTS, sending

          Ego's ship lands in a spaceport. It organically JOINS the
          spot where it lands - strands of material actually linking up
          with the landing pad itself.
                         
          From the front of the craft, a FLOATING TRAM emerges, with
          Ego, Mantis, Quill, Gamora, and Drax.
                         
          As the TRAM GLIDES toward its destination, the Guardians are
          overwhelmed by transcendentally splendid surroundings. The
          plant life is colorful and alien. Tall, twisting obelisks
          seem to have no function other than beauty itself.
