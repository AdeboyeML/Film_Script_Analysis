EXT. CITY STREETS (LOS ANGELES) - NIGHT

CREDIT SEQUENCE.

As OPENING CREDITS play, we study the city's nighttime
pulse, ribbons of headlights moving and cross-connecting
like blood through the veins of a body --
impressionistic, even beautiful, but what we're hearing
is soulful trumpet-based MUSIC, mellow and haunting, the
modern classic -- JAZZ sound of a Wynton Marsalis,
putting a voice to our story. As CREDITS END, we...

                                            DISSOLVE TO:


POV - EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT

Now the MUSIC is GONE, SOUNDS are MUFFLED and vision
blurred. We get the impression of urgent movement. We
hear BREATHING. There are VOICES, SHOUTS, even SCREAMS,
but MUFFLED, far away. Only the breathing is distinct.
We come to realize it is our breathing, and we are inside
someone, looking out. The man whose POV this is is on
the edge of consciousness and not far from death. He
lies on the pavement of a freeway at the site of an
accident only minutes after impact.

His VISION goes IN and OUT of clarity. People are
swarming around him and rushing by toward the carnage of
wrecked vehicles. A SIREN BLOOMS in the distance and
approaches haltingly. The man slips away, comes back
toward consciousness, slips again.

The crowd around the downed man parts to allow passage to
a police officer. It is a woman, Officer SHARON POGUE,
LAPD. She kneels at the man's side, taking charge,
speaking, but we hear only SLIVERS of SOUND. He sees her
face clearly now, close above him.

Sharon is   a dedicated professional and more. We see down
into her   to a place of real caring. She stares into our
eyes and   connects. We begin to hear her now -- and there
are more   SIRENS converging in b.g.

                          SHARON
            Can you hear me?
                   (shouting, off)
            This one's conscious!

                          VOICE (O.S.)
            Paramedics on the way!

We are slipping away again. Sharon holds us with her
eyes, and she grips our hand.

                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                          2.

CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             Wait. Wait. Listen to me.    Can
             you feel that?

She holds on tight.     We see that our hand, held in her
own, is bloody.

                           SHARON
             That's my hand. Hold it.    Go on
             -- as hard as you can.

We watch our hand gripping hers, and as we hold on, the
sights and sounds around us grow more clear.

                           SHARON
             It's over, and I've got you, and
             you're safe. You're safe now.
             You got that? Don't let go.
             Don't let me go.

But our eyes unlock from Sharon's and DRIFT TO a patch of
night sky. Her voice fades awawy. Our POV begins TO
LIFT, MOVING TOWARD that sky, as the blue-black night
begins to turn white. We GO INTO that white light and...

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. LOS ANGELES CITYSCAPE - DAY

We PICK OUT a police car from the traffic and FOLLOW.
The beat being patrolled is a mixed neighborhood with
some very rough edges.


INT. POLICE CAR - DAY

Officer Sharon Pogue is driving the car. It is two years
since we saw her at the accident site. Her partner,
ROBBY LEWIS, sips coffee and keeps one eye on the CAD
monitor which lists all area police calls. She slows
behind a car that is crawling along, an old 60s car,
driven by a young man and woman who sit very close on the
bench seat. The car's ENGINE is MISSING and smoking.

                           SHARON
             That car is older than they are.

                           ROBBY
             '67 Chevy Impala.

                           SHARON
             That's what I said.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                       3.

CONTINUED:

                           ROBBY
             Needs a servicing.

                             SHARON
             Don't we all.

Robby nearly spits his coffee, laughing at what Sharon
has said and trying not to choke. Sharon smiles, shaking
her head.

                           SHARON
             Get it together, officer.

As Robby smiles, Sharon looks ahead at the young couple
who each have an arm around the other. She is stroking
his neck. He is making gentle circles in her hair.
Sharon watches this, and for a moment her eyes reveal a
depth that may be loneliness, but she quickly pushes her
thoughts away and hits the HORN, startling Robby and
startling the people ahead who now disengage and drive
on.

                            ROBBY
             Jesus, Pogo! Almost spilled my
             coffee again! You didn't like his
             hair, or what?

                        SHARON
          I love Elvis hair. They were
          going two damn miles an hour.

But Robby's eyes have caught something on the monitor.

                        ROBBY
          Let's roll to this -- fight in
          progress.

As Robby secures that coffee cup, Sharon hits the SIREN
and speeds around the car in front of them.


EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

At the same time, a few blocks away, an OLD, FRAIL MAN is
carrying two plastic grocery bags that are too heavy for
him.

Walking behind this man is a younger man named CATCH
LAMBERT, an attractive man with some scarring on his
face. His eyes, deep down, are haunted by something, but
there is energy in his step. He is dressed in a relaxed
and stylish manner, not expensive. He begins to pick up
his pace to catch up to the old man.

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                     4.

CONTINUED:

People glance at Catch, nad he glances back in an open
and unflinching way, ready for anything, a smile, a nod,
or -- because these are some of L.A.'s mean streets -- a
threatening or taunting look. These he also meets
openly, without a trace of fear. The man has been
through some kind of fire, and it has left him different
from us. Outside the usual boundaries.

Catch walks beside the Old Man, glancing at him.
Finally, the man glances back, wondering and suspicious,
but Catch has a slight, disarming smile, open and honest.

                           CATCH
             Y'know... since we're both walking
             the same way, I could take one of
             those bags for you. That way, I
             do some upper body work while I'm
             walking along. Helps my back.
             What d'you say?

The Old Man trudges on, proud and suspicious, too.

                           CATCH
             Right now your mind's making
             pictures of me robbing your
             groceires, but, y'know, nine times
             out of ten, people do the right
             thing.

The Old Man glances at him, still not convinced, but he
soon has to stop and rest. Catch stops, too. The old
man looks at him, a bit embarrassed.

                           OLD MAN
             It's the dog food that makes it so
             heavy.

Catch nods, puts out his hand. The Old Man hesitates,
then decides and lifts a bag, and Catch takes it.

                           CATCH
             I guess it's worth it... for a
             good dog.

Catch isn't kidding. He has that honesty. The Old Man
nods and starts trudging again. As they walk on
together, Catch reaches for that second bag. The man
relents and lets him take it. They continue on, Catch
carrying the bags and every now and then lifting them a
bit for his upper body work.

                                                          5.

EXT. VIDEO GAME ROOM - DAY

This is the call Sharon and Robby have sped to. It is a
chaotic scene of cops breaking up a fight between eight
boys, 16-20. A big KID, 18 or so, is being pulled off
another by Sharon and Robby. The Kid is wild and
resisting and Sharon shows her toughness and
professionalism and some anger, too, as she slams him
into a fence -- and Robby holds him while she cuffs the
young man -- who is very mouthy, playing to his friends.

                        KID
          Look at this bitch.    Whoo!   Benny,
          look at this!

Sharon and Robby are both very good at their jobs, taking
this Kid to their car while other cops contain the rest.
A crowd watches -- mostly teens.

                        KID
                 (to Sharon)
          You come in with me.    Hey, bitch.

Some of his bystanders friends howl at that.

                        KID
          You're going to arrest me, you
          come into the back seat with me.
          Come on!

He resists a bit, but they're getting him into the car.

                         KID
          Come on.   We'll have a good time.


INT. POLICE CAR - DAY (FEW MINUTES LATER)

Sharon's on the radio to dispatch as Robby drives and the
Kid keeps mouthing off.

                        SHARON
                 (to radio)
          Three Adam Five -- show us 1019 to
          the jail with one male prisoner.

                        KID
          Take off your uniform. Take off
          my handcuffs, bitch, and come back
          here. I want one touch.

                        ROBBY
          Give it a rest!

Sharon is stone-faced through this.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                           6.

CONTINUED:

                           KID
             If you're going to put me away,
             you gotta give me one sweet touch.


INT. JAIL BOOKING AREA - DAY

As Robby and Sharon bring their suspect to the booking
counter, each holding one of his cuffed arms. The Kid is
looking at Sharon's hand on his arm.

                           KID
             That ain't the touch.   That ain't
             the touch I want.

They get him to the counter.

                           ROBBY
             As I remove your cuffs, I want you
             to put your hands here. Spread
             your legs. More.

As they remove the cuffs, the Kid makes a sudden move
toward Sharon, reaching between her legs -- but she was
not only ready for this, but hoping for it -- and the
stoniness of her face cracks into fierce anger as she
moves quickly and grabs the Kid by the hair, bringing his
face into her upraised knee. He cries out and goes down
on his knees, hurting and bleeding. The jailer rushes
over to help, but Robby grabs the Kid's wrists.

                            ROBBY
             That's it.   Back off, John, we got
             it.

Robby glances at Sharon -- a dark glance.


EXT. POLICE JAIL PARKING LOT - DAY (LATER)

as Robby and Sharon walk to their car. They are
interrupted by one of their lieutenants, SANDERMAN,
walking their way and stopping to stare at Sharon. She
meets his look.

                           SANDERMAN
             You trying to be a bad-ass, Pogue?

She is straightforward, not rebellious.

                           SHARON
             I just dealt with the situation.
             The prisoner...

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                          7.

CONTINUED:

                            SANDERMAN
             And you don't see a pattern here?
                    (pause)
             I want you to keep yourself way
             inside the line instead of walking
             on it. All right? Are you taking
             notes?

He walks away, and Sharon and Robby walk on to their
car -- she is dark; he is glancing at her.

                           ROBBY
             You broke his nose.

                              SHARON
             He grabbed me.     End of story.

                           ROBBY
             And you were waiting for him. You
             were hoping. You were making
             long-range plans for his ass while
             he was mouthing off in the car --
             and you're supposed to be above
             that shit.

                           SHARON
             If you think I crossed the line,
             put it in the report.

                           ROBBY
             Pogo, stop the shit. What is it?
             You pissed off at me, too?

They enter the car, Sharon behind the wheel.

                        SHARON
          Not you, Rob. You're a rare
          unthreatened male cop with a good
          marriage, and you like to eat
          where I eat -- so everything's
          code four.

She STARTS the CAR and starts to back out, and he reaches
over and turns OFF the IGNITION. She stares hotly at
him -- but then, slowly, she softens, takes a deep
breath.

                            ROBBY
          Come over    for dinner tonight.
          I'll call    Charlene. She'd like to
          see you.     It's been awhile. We'll
          talk about    it.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                          8.

CONTINUED:

She STARTS the CAR again, more calm, starts to drive out
of the lot.

                           SHARON
             Thanks. But  she'll invite
             friends, try and fix me up. She's
             always trying to fix me up so she
             doesn't have to worry about you
             and me.

                           ROBBY
             She doesn't worry about that.

                           SHARON
             They all worry about that.

They both smile wryly, driving on.

                           SHARON
             You don't need to fix me, Robby,
             or fix me up. I don't want some
             guy to heart and soul me and then
             walk away 'cause he can't stand
             the cop thing -- or worse: he
             wants cop stories every night
             'cause it turns him on, and he has
             no idea who I am inside my head.
             Anyway, I'm busy tonight.

                           ROBBY
             Got some action, huh?    Well,
             that's promising.

                            SHARON
             Yeah.   Hot and heavy.

                                              IMMEDIATE CUT TO:


INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

She is on the floor using an exercise rig, sliding into
crunches, pushing herself, sweating, alone. We BEGIN
DRIFTING TO the rain-spattered window as night sounds
filter in, HORNS, SOMEONE SHOUTING, a CAR MOVING BY with
THUNDEROUS BASS MUSIC that pulses the very air and
RATTLES the LOOSE GLASS of her window.


EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - NIGHT

Catch Lambert is walking the wet streets, head down in
the rain. Far away we hear that car with a BASS-BLASTING
RADIO.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                       9.

CONTINUED:

In the glow of a street lamp, Catch sees a bright-colored
object in the gutter. He picks it up out of the gurgling
rain water. It is a small toy, a discarded superhero.
He puts it in his pocket, walks on.

Now the car, the prowling, MUSIC-BLASTING, BASS-
THUNDERING CAR turns a corner and begins rollling along
slowly -- beside Catch. He glances over, walking on.
There are four tough-looking MEN in the car, looking for
trouble. The MUSIC is DEAFENING. Catch glances again,
walks on. Their eyes follow him like gun barrels. He
stops and walks out on the street, moving toward the car,
shouting over the music.

                          CATCH
             Hey! You want to turn that volume
             down? What's your point?

The men, incredulous, stop the car and snap OFF the MUSIC
in order to make sure they're hearing right. They stare
death at Catch.

                           DRIVER (MAN)
             What did you say?

                           CATCH
             What's the point of blasting your
             music through the whole zip code?
             Don't you realize there are kids
             trying to sleep in these
             apartments -- old people, sick
             people?

They can hardly believe this.

                           DRIVER
             You better watch your mouth,
             asshole.

Catch meets the man's look with his own unflinching,
haunted eyes.

                            CATCH
             Why?   What're you gonna do?   Kill
             me?

Catch's look is not a macho challenge. It's something
else -- beyond that, a man somehow without limits. One
of the riders in the backseat taps the Driver's shoulder.

                            MAN #2
             Guy's nuts.   Let's go.

The Driver, never breaking his death stare, snaps on the
DEAFENING MUSIC and then slowly rolls on, still glaring
at Catch. Catch stands in the rain, watching them go.

                                                       10.

INT. CATCH'S APARTMENT CORRIDOR - SAME NIGHT

Catch is arriving home, soaking wet. He lives in a
slightly-seedy three-story. As he walks down the
corridor toward his apaprtment, he passes a neighbor's
door and notices a set of keys dangling from the lock.
He pauses -- and then knocks softly on the door.

Someone looks through the peephole and then opens the
door -- a young single mother, friendly but with a little
caution, too. She recognizes Catch. Behind her is a
little boy, (five). The woman's name is CANDACE. Her
son is TOMMY.

                         CANDACE
          Hi.

                         CATCH
          Hi.   Your keys are in the...

He gestures, and she sees the keys and retrieves them,
more friendly now.

                        CANDACE
          Oh, thank you. Thanks a lot.
          God. I was trying to carry Tommy
          and all these bags. He was so
          tired. Of course, as soon as I
          put him down he had all this
          energy...

While she is talking, Catch is staring deeply at the boy,
who is shy. Catch almost speaks to the boy, wants to,
goes halfway to a smile -- but the sight of the kid stirs
that layer of darkness in Catch. He nods a good-bye to
the mother and is about to go. She thinks about this, as
he is turning, and pushes through her remaining caution
to say...

                        CANDACE
          Y'know, we were just baking
          nectarine bars because the peaches
          weren't ripe. Ever had a
          nectarine bar?

He smiles and seems to want to stay, but he is already
retreating. His contact goes only so far -- and no
further.

                         CATCH
          Sorry.   Gotta be going.

And with one more glance at the boy, he walks to his
apartment, unlocks it and steps in.

                                                      11.

INT. CATCH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

He walks into a bare living room -- no chairs, tables,
lamps, nothing on the walls. He walks into a spotless,
never-used kitchen and flips on the light, opens a
drawer.

In the drawer is a collection of kids' toys, some found,
some purchased, mostly plastic figures. The action of
opening the door has started some battery-operated
animals moving around in there. Now from his pocket he
takes the plastic superhero he just found and drops it in
and closes the drawer.

He walks back into the living room. He sits on the
floor, leans back against the wall, his clothes still
soaked from the rain. He stares at his thoughts, looking
a bit numb -- and lost.


EXT./INT. DRY CLEANERS SHOP - DAY

Sharon is just leaving with a clean uniform on a hanger
in a plastic bag. It's a neighborhood place where
alterations are done. As she is leaving, an older woman
is just entering. This is MRS. VANDER, beaming at
Sharon, a real talker.

                         MRS. VANDER
          Sherry!

                        SHARON
          Hi, Mrs. Vander. You're looking
          good.

                        MRS. VANDER
          Oh, you just wait. I splurged.

She is pulling a new blue dress out of a shopping bag.

                        MRS. VANDER
          It's for the church and the party.
          It's just a little too long.

                         SHARON
          Looks great.

                         MRS. VANDER
          Y'know, I cried over the
          invitation -- just imagine me in
          church.
                  (laughs)
          It'll be so good to spend time
          with you.

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                           12.

CONTINUED:

Sharon forces a smile -- but is mystified. Mrs. Vander
is walking to the counter and pausing to say...

                           MRS.   VANDER
             You know Dan and I   renewed our
             vows last year. I    bet that's
             where your mom got   the idea.

                           SHARON
             Their vows?

                           MRS. VANDER
             Your mom and dad -- the
             ceremony...

Mrs. Vander realizes what's going on and stammers on,
sympathetic and embarrassed.

                           MRS. VANDER
             Oh, well... y'know, I just got
             that invitation a few... just now,
             so I'm sure you'll...

                           SHARON
             Oh, yeah. We've had... there's
             been some problems with the mail
             in our building, so... I'll
             probably get it today.

They're both covering like mad, both realizing Sharon's
been left out.

                           SHARON
             So, I guess I'll see you.

                           MRS. VANDER
          Sure, honey.     I'll see you there.

Sharon leaves -- Mrs. Vander staring after her, feeling
bad. As Sharon walks away, we see her forced smile die,
replaced by an old pain and darkness.


EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY

Robby and Sharon's unit pulls up at a house remodel with
a sign marked "POGUE CONSTRUCTION." Sharon exits the car
and walks onto the site, moves toward a man who is both
carpenter and supervisor on the job. This is her
brother, LARRY POGUE, 29. They are not comfortable with
each other -- an old wound. He gives her a wary nod.
She's trying a little harder, being a bit more friendly.
We can sense the strain.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                          13.

CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             I didn't see his truck, so...

                              LARRY
             He's not here.

                              SHARON
             How you doing?

She touches his shoulder as she says this, a friendly
gesture, a reaching out. He doesn't respond, only
shrugs.

                              LARRY
             I'm okay.

                           SHARON
             Kathy and the boy? Bet he's big
             now.

                              LARRY
             Growin' fast.

                           SHARON
             Is he looking more like you now --
             or did he get lucky?

She has broken through a bit and they both smile a brief,
wry smile.

                            LARRY
             He's got Kathy's looks and brains
             and my strong back. You should
             feel his grip.
                    (pause)
             You just passing by?

She looks about.

                           SHARON
             Place is coming along nice. The
             octagon window. Dad's signature.

But Larry's look stays on her, wondering what's on her
mind.

                           SHARON
             Look, Larry, I shouldn't have to
             hear it from Mrs. Vander -- about
             what's happening.

He turns back to his work now as they speak,
uncomfortable.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                           14.

CONTINUED:

                           LARRY
             What's happening?

                           SHARON
                    (hurt)
             So you really weren't going to
             tell me? Nobody was going to tell
             me? Mom and Dad renewing their
             vows, the church, the party. Mrs.
             Vander is all excited. She bought
             a new dress. It's blue.

                           LARRY
             We're workin' on Dad. We think
             you should be there. We told him.

                             SHARON
             Mom told him?

                           LARRY
             We mentioned it.

                           SHARON
             He's holding out, hah?

                           LARRY
             You want to come?

                           SHARON
             It's my family. Jesus, Lar. It's
             over ten years, and he won't let
             go of it.

                           LARRY
             You two were always head to head.

                        SHARON
          For good reason. Remember?

                        LARRY
          Let's just leave it.

She stares, then...

                        SHARON
          You're still scared of him.

Pissed, he throws his hammer down on the plywood, turns
to her.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                           15.

CONTINUED:

                           LARRY
             I don't think it's a good idea you
             coming around here in uniform.
             People see it, they think we're in
             trouble here.

                           SHARON
             Nice seeing you, too.

She walks away.     He frowns, picks up his hammer, goes
back to work.


ON STREET

As Sharon walks towards the car, she sees a van
approaching and she holds up a hand to Robby and calls
out...

                           SHARON
             Two more minutes.

And she walks toward the oncoming van, which is parking
now.


EXT. VAN - DAY

The van is driven by KATHY, Sharon's brother's wife.
Beside her in a car seat is LARRY, JR., four years old.
Sharon comes to the rolled down window on the driver's
side. She has a warm smile for Kathy and the child.
Kathy smiles, too.

                         KATHY
            Hi! Look -- it's your Auntie
            Sharon.

                          SHARON
            Hey, Champ, my God, look how big.

She has a special affection for the boy -- who is
subdued, but he smiles a small one for his aunt. She
takes one of his hands and they shake in mock formality.

                          LARRY JR.
            Hi.

                         SHARON
            Ow! You hurt my hand with that
            grip. Whew.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                         16.

CONTINUED:

She shakes her fingers, and he smiles a bit more. Sharon
reaches in and rubs his head in a mock knuckling move.
He laughs. She smooths his hair, affectionately.

                           KATHY
             We're bringing Larry his lunch.
             Hey, it's good to see you. It's
             been awhile. What?

Sharon is staring at Kathy's badly bruised ear.

                           KATHY
             Oh, I went boom into a low shelf
             -- chasing after him of course.
                    (nodding to the child)
             How're you doing?

Sharon pulls her eyes off the bruise to meet Kathy's look
-- and connect.

                           SHARON
             I'm semi-okay. I heard about
             the... ceremony and the party.

                             KATHY
                     (embarrassed)
             Oh. I hope you'll be there.
                     (pause)
             Really.

Sharon smiles a bit, appreciating the support.       She pats
Kathy's arm.

                             SHARON
             Take it easy.    You too, Champ.

The boy offers his little hand to shake again.

                            SHARON
             Oh, no. You're not breaking my
             fingers again.

They smile and drive on and Sharon walks toward her car
and Robby.


EXT. CITY PARK - DAY (NEXT DAY)

We WATCH moms and kids and a basketball game in the park
and PICK UP Catch walking by. Two pre-teens are playing
bounce and catch with a rubber ball against a (tennis
practice) wall, and one of them misses, and Catch makes a
lunge and snags the ball. Instead of throwing it to one
of the boys, he fires it at the wall.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                       17.

CONTINUED:

One of the boys catches it, bounces it off the wall
toward Catch. Catch grabs it, and now he's part of this
rapid-fire game -- and he's athletic and funny, too,
playing hard and mugging and making them smile until... a
POLICE CAR comes ROARING down the boulevard, slowing a
bit to CHIRP its SIREN a few times -- clearing traffic.
Catch glances up and sees...


CATCH'S POV

Sharon is in the car beside Robby.


ON CATCH

Stunned by the sight of her -- and he doesn't know why.
He can't move, can't breathe, eyes fixed on her. The
POLICE CAR pulls around a truck and ROARS on -- and
that's when he is struck by a memory, a little like
lightning. It comes as a quick --


FLASHBACK - EXT. FREEWAY - ACCIDENT SITE    - CATCH'S POV

-- The man near death. Sharon is bending close to him,
this all just a sliver of an image, and it jolts him.


BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT)

The police car is now converging with other squads just
half a block away. Catch throws the ball back to the
boys and runs toward the police incident. The boys watch
him go, wondering.


EXT. CLOSED STORE - DAY

A police   car is parked askew near this closed store -- as
now Robby   and Sharon's UNIT ROARS to a STOP beside it.
Two cops   are calling and motioning to them, one holds a
shotgun.    This is RAY JULIETTE.

                           RAY
             Break-in alarm. One suspect in --
             nobody out. Take the back.

And they are moving.


EXT. BACK OF CLOSED STORE - DAY

Robby and Sharon are hurrying around to the back as we
hear more POLICE UNITS CONVERGING in front.

                                                      18.

ANGLE - STREET

As Catch arrives on the scene and sees Sharon and Robby
moving around the building to the back. He is still
amazed at the sight of her. He decides to follow her,
keeping her in sight, driven.


ON SHARON, ROBBY

They are scouting through crates and weeds as a young man
is flushed from cover at the back of the store and runs
from them.

                         ROBBY
          Freeze!

The man runs on, and Sharon chases with Robby close
behind her. Sharon speaks to her shoulder radio mike as
she runs.

                        SHARON
                 (to radio)
          Three-A-5, foot pursuit. Suspect
          fleeing south on Pico Place, young
          man, green jacket. No visible
          weapon...
                 (to Robby)
          Robby!

                        ROBBY
          Right behind you!
                 (to man)
          Stop and lie down with your
          arms... shit.

The man has jumped a fence.   Sharon follows.

                         ROBBY
          Careful!

                         SHARON
          I see him!

She goes over the fence, then Robby.


EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

The man runs and Sharon chases. Robby, not far behind
glances off to the side, seeing Catch, still following.

                        ROBBY
          Citizen on your right!   Hey!

                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                     19.

CONTINUED:

But Sharon is now closing on the fleeing man who turns
suddenly, pointing a handgun!

                              ROBBY
             Gun!

And Sharon, wide-eyed, is already pulling her weapon, but
not in time. The man is aiming at her and about to fire
when he is tackled by Catch.

Catch and the man go sprawling, and the gun flies out of
the man's hand, and Sharon is on him in an instant,
pointing her gun at him...

                             SHARON
             Freeze!    Right there!

Catch scrambles to his feet. Robby joins Sharon and puts
his knee in the man's back and cuffs him, then glances at
Catch. So does Sharon. But Catch starts to hurry off.

                              ROBBY
             Hey!     Wait!

Two other cops (Ray Juliette and SANCHEZ) rush toward the
suspect on the ground.

                              RAY
             You got him?

                              ROBBY
             He was armed.

                              RAY
             Jesus.

                           ROBBY
             Citizen took him down.

                              RAY
             No shit!?

Sharon stares across the lot to where Catch has halted.
More cops are converging. Ray Juliette and Sanchez move
toward Catch, while a sergeant and others surround Sharon
and the suspect. In between the crowd of cops, Catch and
Sharon glance at each other, during...


ON CATCH

as the cops reach him.

                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                       20.

CONTINUED:

                           RAY
             What happened here?

                           CATCH
             I... just saw it and... I saw the
             gun, so...


ON SHARON

                           ROBBY
             You all right, Pogo?

She is shaken, speaks softly.

                            SHARON
             I was dead.   Y'know.

She glances toward Catch. (She doesn't recognize him
from the accident.) Their eyes meet briefly, but then
their attention is pulled to the others. Sharon speaks
to her sergeant.

                             SHARON
             He had me.    I was dead.


ON CATCH

He is shaken, too.    Sanchez is taking notes as Ray checks
his I.D.

                           CATCH
             I was just walking by.      I live
             near here.

Ray nods, handing the I.D. to Sanchez.

                           SANCHEZ
             Sergeant's going to want to talk
             to you, Mr. Lambert. We'll need a
             statement.

                           RAY
             Don't worry about it. That's just
             procedure. Look -- we appreciate
             what you did. No bullshit. Let
             us buy you a drink tonight, all
             right? You know where the Rib
             House is?

Catch glances at Sharon again, and he nods.

                                                       21.

EXT. UPSCALE RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY (SAME DAY)

Catch, a bit bruised and dirty from his tackle, is
carrying groceries up the walkway steps to a small, well-
kept home. He is taking out a key as he walks to the
covered portico.


INT. MRS. CHU'S HOME - DAY

ELANORA CHU, 60, is an attractive woman with warmth and
intelligence in her eyes. She is in a wheelchair, at a
writing table where she carefully translates an English
text into Chinese characters.

She glances up as Catch opens the front door and heads
for the kitchen, speaking as he goes, not looking at her
or into the living room at all.

                        CATCH
          I got you nectarines because the
          peaches are hard as rocks.

                        ELANORA
          Your jacket's all dirty.

She rolls away from the table in her motorized chair --
and as they speak across the house, she performs a
ritual...

                        CATCH (O.S.)
          I tackled a guy.

Elanora is moving about the living room, picking up
framed photographs and turning them face down. We don't
see what -- or who -- is in these photos. She is turning
them all in a routine way, used to this.

                        ELANORA
          Why would you 'tackle' a guy?!

                        CATCH (O.S.)
          Why do you think?


INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Catch is at the cupboards, putting away groceries as
Elanora rolls into the kitchen, her CHAIR HUMMING.

                        CATCH
          He had the ball. He was going for
          a touchdown.

                        ELANORA
          Can you be serious?

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                        22.

CONTINUED:

                           CATCH
                    (as he works)
             What day is today?

                            ELANORA
             Wednesday.

                            CATCH
             No.

They are not smiling at their little jokes, but they have
an ease with each other and the deep love of dear
friends. He doesn't pause in his work, but we can see
some nervousness in him as he says...

                           CATCH
             Met somebody today.

Mrs. Chu is now taking some of the groceries out of the
bags to help.

                           ELANORA
             Oh? That's good. Ahh -- they had
             the broccolini today. Thank you.

                            CATCH
             A woman.

Elanora is more interested and curious now, still helping
with the groceries and being casual.

                           ELANORA
             You didn't tackle her, too, did
             you?

                            CATCH
             No.

                            ELANORA
             Good, Catch.

                           CATCH
             She's a police officer.

                           ELANORA
                    (stops; worried)
             Are you in trouble?

Catch goes on working, a depth in his eyes.

                            CATCH
             No.   No trouble.

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                          23.

CONTINUED:

Elanora watches him work and gladdens slightly.     We see
her own depth of feeling.

                           ELANORA
             Well... that's a good thing.

He is still working, but his eyes are on his thoughts,
his struggle.

                           CATCH
             I saw her once a long time ago.

Elanora stares a moment.      This has meaning for her.

                            ELANORA
             Where?

He doesn't answer.      He's nervous about this.

                           CATCH
             She looks the same.

Now she watches him as he moves to the refrigerator and
continues his work in silence.


INT. RIB HOUSE - THAT NIGHT

It's a noisy restaurant with a large bar area. We PAN TO
a booth of off-duty cops, out of uniform now, including
Ray, Sanchez, Sharon and a few more male officers.
They're all a bit high. Sharon shows the signs, too.
They are passing around a photo now as one COP looks at
it and says...

                            COP
             Beautiful.

... And Sanchez says proudly.

                            SANCHEZ
             Yeah. My wife's got him in
             agility class.

                            RAY
             No shit.

Ray is handed the photo, and we see that they're talking
about Sanchez's dog, the name "REX" printed on the photo.

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                         24.

CONTINUED:

                           RAY
             'Rex.' Rex is good. I wonder who
             the first person was to name a dog
             'Fido,' and what the hell does it
             mean?

                           SHARON
             I like how you're always asking
             the big questions, Ray.

There is some laughter.     Ray is a smart-ass and a flirt.

                           RAY
             I got a big question for you, Pogo
             -- but I can only ask it when
             we're alone.

She moves some of the change on the table, sliding it
toward Ray.

                           SHARON
             Here -- use this -- call your wife
             and ask her instead.

                           SANCHEZ
             I happen to know Ray's wife is
             busy tonight.

They laugh and drink and Ray asks her...

                           RAY
             Why doesn't your partner ever come
             out with us?

                           SHARON
             Robby's a family man.

                           RAY
             I'm a family man.

                        SHARON
          Yeah, but his family actually
          likes him.

More laughter. Sharon's eyes do a quick roam of the bar.
Ray catches this.

                        RAY
          That Lambert -- I guess he's not
          showing either.

She shrugs this off like it's not important and starts to
slide out of the booth.

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                          25.

CONTINUED:

                           RAY
             Where are you going?

                            SHARON
             The head.   Do you mind?

                           SANCHEZ
             She's just gonna freshen up her
             makeup.

                           RAY
             You're wearing makeup?

She leaves the booth with a wry frown.

                           SHARON
             That reminds me, Ray. You still
             have that eye-liner you borrowed
             from me?

She grins, leaving the laughter behind her.


ANGLE - DOOR

Catch has entered the bar. He is watching Sharon leave
the booth and walk to the rest rooms. He looks back at
the raucous booth and hesitates. He sits at a small
table near the door.


INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

Sharon is drying her hands in the bar's bathroom, staring
into the mirror. No smile now. We see into her mind for
a second.


FLASHBACK - MAN

Pointing the gun at her face today.


BACK TO SHARON (PRESENT)

in the mirror and see how shaken she still is.


ON CATCH

A waitress is leaving his table, and he looks back at
Sharon's booth and sees that she still isn't there. He
starts to turn, and then freezes as he hears...

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                         26.

CONTINUED:

                              SHARON (O.S.)
             There you are.

She has stepped out of the bathroom and spotted him.      He
is surprised, face to face now.

                           SHARON
             We thought you wouldn't show.    Why
             you sitting here?

He shrugs.

                           CATCH
             I don't talk to a lot of people.
             Would you...?

He half rises and gestures to the other chair. She
glances back at her booth, then sits. She's nervous,
too.

                           SHARON
             I didn't have a chance to thank
             you. I'm Sharon Pogue.

She puts out her hand. He stares at that hand for just
half a beat before taking it. They shake. The feel of
her hand holding his evokes the memory of the accident,
but he covers this.

                           SHARON
             You look familiar.

                           CATCH
             I guess I live on the beat you
             patrol.

Her way to cover nervousness is to be blunt, even tough.

                           SHARON
             Why would you do that -- jump a
             man with a gun?

                           CATCH
                    (shrugs)
             He was going to shoot you.

                           SHARON
             He could've shot you. You have a
             death wish? You a bungee jumper?

                          CATCH
             No. I didn't have time to think
             about it.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                          27.

CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             What d'you think about it now?

                           CATCH
             I figure... it was worth the risk.

                           SHARON
             For someone you don't even know?

                           CATCH
             Yeah -- and for what you do. I
             think cops are great. Out there,
             trying to keep it safe. You know?
             Tough job. Firemen are
             everybody's heroes. Kids wave at
             firemen. People should wave at
             cops. Did you ever think about
             how many people are walking around
             this town because you saved them?

                           SHARON
             I never thought about it.

                           CATCH
             ... because you helped them or
             because you arrested somebody who
             would've hurt them or because you
             just... did your job?

                           SHARON
             Now I'm walking around this town
             because of you. Ever think about
             that? Maybe you should be a cop.

                        CATCH
          I don't know... I look pretty dumb
          in a hat...

He has made her smile.

                        CATCH
          ... and I don't drive and, like I
          said, I don't talk to many people.
          Am I talking too much? I am. You
          go ahead.

                         SHARON
          Okay. What d'you do? You
          employed around here? Oh, God.
          Sorry. Every time I try to talk
          to somebody, it comes out like an
          interrogation.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                          28.

                           CATCH
             Where do you want to be ten years
             from now?

                             SHARON
             What?

                           CATCH
             Somebody taught that to me. Kind
             of a shortcut. You ask somebody,
             what are your plans for
             tomorrow -- what're your dreams
             for ten years from now. It's
             supposed to get things started.

                             SHARON
             Does it work?

                           CATCH
             I never tried it.

                             SHARON
             Bullshit.

                           CATCH
             No. Really. I just remembered it
             -- God is my witness.

                             SHARON
             Not in here.    It's mostly cops.

Now she has made him smile, the first real smile we've
seen from Catch. It's open and real and she is charmed
by it.

                           SHARON
             You have a nice smile.

She's a bit self-conscious, saying that, and just as she
says it, the waitress arrives with shots and beers for
both of them. Sharon looks up, questioning, and the
waitress nods toward the booth. Catch and Sharon see the
cops, staring, smiling, raising their glasses. There is
a hint of teasing in their grins. And now Sharon is more
self-conscious, and a bit tough again, taking her drink
and turning back to Catch.

                           SHARON
             So... what were we talking about?
             Oh, yeah, you were giving me some
             line about starting a
             conversation.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                           29.

CONTINUED:

                             CATCH
             The shortcut.

                             SHARON
             Okay.    I'll play.

They clink glasses and drink.         Then...

                           SHARON
             Tomorrow I've got a night watch
             shift. If the weather clears, in
             the morning I'll go hiking. If it
             rains, I'll go to the gym -- and
             the laundromat. Ten years from
             now... I want to be living in some
             mountainous place.

                              CATCH
             Tibet?

                           SHARON
             Could be Tibet. Could be
             Colorado. Your turn.

But now Ray Juliette is approaching the table.

                           RAY
             Hey, Pogo -- don't keep him all to
             yourself. Come on over, Lambert,
             join the group. We'll buy you
             dinner, give you a medal for
             saving Pogo's ass.

Sharon drains her shot and stands.

                           SHARON
             Actually, I'm kind of tired, Ray.
             I'm taking off.

                              CATCH
             Oh.     I'll... walk you to your car.

Catch stands and turns to Ray.

                           CATCH
             Thanks for the drink.

                           RAY
             Least we could do. We don't like
             her very much -- but we don't want
             to lose her.

Sharon frowns and waves to the booth of cops.        Ray smiles
and shakes hands with Catch as a good-bye.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                          30.

CONTINUED:

                           CATCH
             Take care.

And Catch and Sharon leave.


EXT. BAR - NIGHT

As Catch and Sharon exit the building, walk toward her
car.

                           SHARON
             It's not a great neighborhood.
             Maybe I should walk you to your
             car.

                           CATCH
             I don't have a car.

They walk on, silent a moment.      This doesn't come easy
for her.

                           SHARON
             Want a ride home?

                           CATCH
             Oh, thanks, but... I like to walk.

                           SHARON
             It's starting to rain.   Don't be a
             hero.

He hesitates, nervous about it, but then...

                          CATCH
             Yeah. If it's no trouble.
             Thanks.

They walk to her car.

                           SHARON
             Okay... ten years from now, what
             d'you want to be doing?

They walk side by side a moment.      He shrugs.   Then -- in
his open way...

                          CATCH
          I don't know.    This is pretty
          good.

She glances at him, taking this in, then fumbles a bit
with her car keys, and he asks -- nervously again...

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                        31.

CONTINUED:

                           CATCH
             Can you drive okay?

She gets a little defensive.

                        SHARON
          I'm not drunk. You think I'm
          drunk? I'm not. You'll know I'm
          drunk when I'm throwing up, and I
          never throw up, so don't worry
          about it.

He nods, looks at her dead-on a moment.

                        CATCH
          The only time I worry is when
          people tell me not to worry.

                        SHARON
          Get in the car, will you?


INT. CAR - NIGHT

As they get in and she STARTS the ENGINE.

                        CATCH
          I'm on Lundy Street, just off
          Pico.

They drive a while. She notices his anxiety.     He grips
the armrest when she speeds up.

                        SHARON
          I'm good at this.

                        CATCH
          Streets are wet.

                        SHARON
          Are you one of those people who
          drive ten miles an hour in the
          rain? I hate that.

                           CATCH
          I never drive.

She glances at him, and he notices her glance.

                        CATCH
          I'll be alright.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                           32.

CONTINUED:

He's forcing himself to relax. He takes a deep breath,
sitting back in his seat. He watches her as she drives.
After a moment...

                           CATCH
             Y'know, I can picture you in
             Colorado.

                            SHARON
             Oh yeah?   What am I doing there?

                           CATCH
             Driving around... pissed off.

She smiles in spite of herself, slows down.

                           SHARON
             I'm not pissed off at you.

                           CATCH
             Give me some time.

Now she laughs. She drives, not to his building, but to
her own street. She parks, takes a deep breath. This
sounds a bit hard-bitten because she's using her
toughness to cover.

                            SHARON
             Those guys  in the bar are my
             friends --  sort of. We work
             together,  we tell jokes and we
             bullshit,  but I can't say to
             them...

She halts.

                            CATCH
             What?

She says this clipped and fast and even tougher:

                       SHARON
         Every time I close my eyes, I see
         that goddamn gun pointing at me
         and I don't know why I'm telling
         you unless it's because you were
         there and because I had three
         drinks, but I'm not ready to go
         inside and close my eyes and I
         don't want to go to your place and
         I don't want to keep driving
         around, so what the hell do we do?

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                          33.

CONTINUED:

                           CATCH
             Whew. I feel like we're boxing,
             and you've got me on the ropes.
                    (pause)
             We'll do whatever you want.

                            SHARON
             What I want  is to know how you
             happened to  be walking by that
             parking lot  at that minute. What
             if you hadn' t been there?

For a moment, she shows her fear.

                           CATCH
             I guess we were supposed to meet.

They stare a while, then she opens her door.

                           SHARON
             If you want -- you can come in for
             a minute.


INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

As they walk in, she moves into the kitchen.

                             SHARON
             Want a drink?

                             CATCH
             No thanks.

She pours one for herself while he looks about. It's a
stiff drink. Now that he's here, her I-don't-want-to-
make-a-fool-of-myself alarm is on. She flops on the
sofa, watches him.

                           SHARON
             Sit down or something.

                           CATCH
             I'm circling awhile.

He's looking around at the clutter of her life -- the
intimate details.

                            SHARON
             You're not supposed to look
             around. I didn't have time to
             straighten up.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                           34.

CONTINUED:

                           CATCH
             So... it's more real this way.

                           SHARON
             It's rude.

He turns to her.

                           CATCH
             Now that I'm in here, you seem mad
             about it.

                           SHARON
             I'm not mad. You'll know when I'm
             mad. I don't usually let somebody
             in here, but here you are. That's
             all. Let's talk about something
             stupid.

                           CATCH
             You first.

She smiles in spite of herself.

                           SHARON
             Okay -- one thing I don't believe
             is that 'supposed to' business.
             We were 'supposed to' meet. That
             sounds a little fringy to me, like
             something you might hear on public
             access TV. You believe that?

                           CATCH
             Some people say we each give off a
             particular odor -- that can only
             be detected by one other person's
             brain.

                           SHARON
             So, we... smell each other?   Who
             says that?

                           CATCH
             I have no idea.
                    (as they smile)
             I'm more in the destiny school,
             we-met-in-another-life school. Do
             you believe that? Do you think
             when we die -- we come back in
             another form?

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                          35.

CONTINUED:

                             SHARON
             You mean like   a duck? No. I
             think dead is   dead. I've been
             thinking about   it all day -- and I
             don't want to   think about it
             anymore.

He looks at her, steps close to her, takes the drink out
of her hand, puts it to his lips and drinks it all down.
He puts the glass on the table.

                           SHARON
             Why'd you do that?

                            CATCH
             See?   Now you're thinking about
             me.

She gets a half smile, assessing him. Her look is
direct, and the attraction is there. He feels it, too,
and he deflects it, nodding toward a large photomural of
snowcapped mountains.

                             CATCH
          Let me guess.       Colorado.

                        SHARON
          It's Austria, but I can't picture
          myself in Austria. I'm not good
          with languages, so I couldn't
          qualify for the departments over
          there.

She rises and goes to a desk and takes the holstered gun
off her ankle. She takes the cuffs off her belt, the
mace from her jacket, the shield from her shirt pocket,
puts them all in a desk drawer. She takes off her jacket
and throws it over a chair. Disarmed, she turns to him.
Her look is all wanting and pushing away, almost fierce
in her struggle. He sees this.

                           SHARON
             Thanks for... coming up here.

                           CATCH
             Does that mean I'm going?

                             SHARON
                      (flustered)
             No.    You don't have to.    I...

                              CATCH
             You okay now?

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                     36.

CONTINUED:

Her eyes grow a bit hard, defensive.

                             SHARON
             Oh.    You're here as a medic.

                           CATCH
             Is this the mad part?

She smiles in spite of herself -- again. He has gotten
to her. She wants to fall into this guy, but she's
pumping those brakes. They are standing close together.

                           SHARON
             Maybe going is a good idea.

                           CATCH
             Can I come back some time?

                             SHARON
             Why?

                           CATCH
                    (shrugs)
             Must be the smell.

That makes her laugh, and her resistance falls away with
her surprised laughter, and she puts her hands around the
back of his neck. Her touch is electric to him. She is
going in for a kiss, and he is retreating. They stare a
moment -- and then he suddenly takes her shoulders and
lets loose his own longing. It is a hungry and
passionate kiss, and in the very midst of it, he breaks
off and pulls back, his darkness rushing at him. She is
staring, surprised, and he is looking a bit shaken,
getting the words out just above a whisper.

                             CATCH
             I better go.

She doesn't know what to say. The moment hangs. He
leaves. Once he closes the door, the breath escapes her,
and she shakes her head -- feeling like an idiot. She
lost control. With a stranger.

                             SHARON
             Oh, God.


EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Catch leaving Sharon's building in a turmoil of emotions,
staring hard at his thoughts -- and he steps into the
path of a car. The CAR SCREECHES to a stop, and the
scream of those brakes and white light of the head lamps
paralyze Catch, and he sees --

                                                         37.

FLASHBACK - SLIVER OF IMAGE

Headlights suddenly washing into a vehicle he is driving.


BACK TO SCENE    (PRESENT)

This sliver of memory jolts HIM -- and then another one
comes.


FLASHBACK - HEADLIGHTS

coming closer and the scream of brakes from his memory,
and all of this is exploded --


BACK TO SCENE    (PRESENT)

by the angry DRIVER shouting at him.


                        DRIVER
          What the hell do you think you're
          doing?!

Catch is numb -- completely shut down there in the middle
of the street. The Driver exits his car and comes toward
him, raging.

                        DRIVER
          Are you crazy?!

Catch isn't even aware of him. The man gawks at this --
and now Catch walks off. It is raining. The streets are
wet.


ANGLE - RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

As Catch continues his walk, he is still a bit shaken --
but when he passes a parked car with the window half
open, rain getting in, he hesitates. He can't just walk
on. He looks about. He tests the lock. He opens the
door, rolls up the window, closes the door, walks on.

But a MAN is just exiting a doorway to the street -- and
calls out...

                           MAN
          Hey!    Hey!   What did you do?

Catch stops and turns in the rain.     The Man hurries
toward him, upset, angry.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                               38.

CONTINUED:

                              MAN
             That's my car!     What the hell were
             you doing?

                             CATCH
             Nothing.    I just...

The Man shoves him.

                             MAN
             I saw you!    What did you take out
             of there?!

                            CATCH
             No, I rolled up the window.       It's
             rain...

The Man gets in his face, shaky...

                           MAN
             You take my phone?!       Hah?!

He shoves Catch again, and Catch's desperate confusion
explodes in a surprising reaction, grabbing the Man's
jacket front in one hand and not punching him but quickly
slap, slap, slapping him, saying...

                              CATCH
             Hey!   Hey!    Wake up!    Wake up!

The Man is now speechless, frozen, terrified, as Catch's
eyes hold him with a fierceness -- and a sadness.

                              CATCH
             I helped you.
                    (pause)
             I helped you.

Catch lets him go, and immediately begins walking away,
hunching into the rain, his expression dark and troubled.
He gets five steps away and turns. The Man steps back --
but Catch only says...

                              CATCH
             I'm sorry.

And he walks on.        The Man watches him go.


INT. CATCH'S APARTMENT BUILDING CORRIDOR - NEXT DAY

Candace, Catch's neighbor, is waiting for the slow,
RATTLING ELEVATOR with her son.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                       39.

CONTINUED:

The elevator door opens -- and there is Catch, seated on
a newly-bought wicker chair in the elevator with a small
table across his lap, other boxes nearby and a
long-stemmed rose in his hand, wrapped for giving.

                             CATCH
             Oh.   Sorry.

He rises and hurriedly gets his purchases off the
elevator so the woman and little boy can enter.

                             CANDACE
             Shopping day?

He smiles at her, a bit less subdued than before as he
gets his things into the hall -- and he manages a special
look for Tommy, a wink. He frees the elevator; they step
inside. As the door starts to close, Catch's face
"follows" the sliding door with a funny look for the boy.
We hear Tommy laugh as the door closes. Catch carries
his new possessions to his apartment.


EXT. OLDER HOUSE - LATE DAY

A well-kept older home, well-planted, pretty. A woman of
nearly 60 is tending the flowers. She hears someone
approaching the gate in the wooden fence. She looks up.
Sharon is at the gate, in uniform, on her dinner break.
The older woman is her MOTHER, Elaine Pogue. There is an
old strain between them, a sadness -- and a nervousness
in Elaine. She's a quiet woman. She smiles at her
daughter as Sharon comes through the gate. They hug
tentatively, a lot of baggage here. Sharon turns to the
garden.

                           SHARON
             It's looking great, Mom.

                           MOTHER
                    (pleased)
             Thanks, honey. It's the best year
             ever for the impatiens. The very
             best.

There is a beat of awkward silence.

                             MOTHER
             Let's go in.


INT. POGUE HOME - DAY

As they enter.

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                          40.

CONTINUED:

It's a bit dark inside, older furniture, lots of keepsake
clutter and photos. Sharon is restless in here -- bad
memories.

                           SHARON
             Looks the same. Still smells like
             cigarettes. I thought he quit.

                           MOTHER
             He's down to six a day.

                           SHARON
             Your hair looks nice.

Her Mother touches her hair, self-consciously. She can't
help glancing at her daughter in all that gear --
bullet-proof vest under her shirt, radio, cuffs -- and
that gun.

                              MOTHER
             Are you well?

Sharon steps close to the mantel. There is a photo of
her there, graduating from the police academy, a
professional, not a family shot. She is surprised.

                           SHARON
             I guess I'm well. Is this always
             here?

                            MOTHER
             Yes.   It's always there.

                           SHARON
             Did Larry tell you I came by where
             he's working? Is that why you
             called me?

                           MOTHER
             I called because we want to invite
             you to our renewal of vows. It's
             three weeks from Saturday.

                              SHARON
             Who's 'we.'     You said 'we' want to
             invite you.

                              MOTHER
             The family.

Sharon takes that in, still looking about.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                          41.

CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             How come you're renewing your
             vows?

                           MOTHER
             It's sort of... a fresh start.

                            SHARON
             Your idea?

                           MOTHER
             No. Both of us. It's a way of...
             having the marriage blessed.

                           SHARON
             Wasn't it blessed before?

Her Mother sighs, sad for all the trouble between them.

                           MOTHER
             Sherry... of course it was
             blessed. You just...

                           SHARON
             I just what, Mom?

                           MOTHER
             You just think about the bad, and
             you never remember the good. I
             wish you remembered the good.

Sharon stares deeply at her.

                           SHARON
             Sorry.  I wish I did, too.
                    (then, almost
                     like a child)
             Does he? Remember any good about
             me?

                           MOTHER
             Of course. He doesn't hate you.
             He just... still feels hurt.

                             SHARON
             Hurt?    I hurt him?

                       MOTHER
         Being arrested like that.
         Somebody doesn't forget that.

                      SHARON
         Oh? How come you forgot what he
         did?

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                        42.

CONTINUED:

                           MOTHER
             It wasn't as bad -- you always
             make it sound worse. And it
             hasn't been that way for years.

                        SHARON
          I'm glad it hasn't been that way.
          That means it worked, Mom. That
          was the point. That's why I did
          it. Christ. Why do I get
          punished for it?

                        MOTHER
          Honey, nobody's punishing you.
          We're inviting you. Will you
          come?

                        SHARON
          Of course I'll come.

                        MOTHER
          We didn't think you'd want to.

                          SHARON
          Why not?

Now her Mother shows a trace of fear.     She says gently...

                        MOTHER
          We don't want any trouble... on
          that day. Please.

                           SHARON
             Mom, I'm your daughter. I don't
             want any trouble -- ever. I'll
             come to the ceremony. I won't
             come to argue, and I won't come in
             uniform.

They each get a small, sad smile.

                           MOTHER
             It's on the 23rd. Saint Monica's.

                           SHARON
             I'd like you to send me an
             invitation. Mrs. Vander said it's
             a beautiful invitation.

Her Mother starts to leave the room.

                              MOTHER
             I'll show you.

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                        43.

CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             Mom. I'd like to get one... in
             the mail... from my family. Okay?

                           MOTHER
             Yes.

Sharon goes to the door, then stops and turns, letting
her guard down all the way to say...

                           SHARON
             Tell Dad... thanks.

And she leaves.


EXT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - EVENING

Sharon is climbing the   outdoor staircase to her
apartment, tired after   her shift, drained a bit   by her
visit home. When she    reaches her door she sees   that a
long-stemmed rose has   been masking-taped to her   door.
Written on the masking   tape is: "Catch Lambert"    and a
phone number.

She pauses, staring at this, gets a little grin.


INT. SHARON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (HOURS LATER)

Sharon is dressed for bed in a sleep shirt, lying on the
bed, surrounded by old photos and a couple of photo
albums from her girlhood. In a vase on her bed table is
Catch's rose.

Sharon is feeling blue, looking at her young self within
the family that has shut her out. She closes the book,
angry at herself for nearly crying. She sits up and
catches sight of the rose and rummages in the drawer and
pulls out the tape with Catch's phone number on it.

She's very conflicted    about this. She puts the tape
down, but it sticks to    her fingers. She tears it off and
tries to throw it onto    the table, but it hangsoff her
thumb. She sighs and     steels herself and dialsthe
number.


INT. CATCH'S APARTMENT

He has bought a shelf unit that "needs some assembly" and
he's at work with a screwdriver, his new chair and table
nearby, the phone on the floor. PHONE RINGS, and he
picks it up.

                                                          44.

FULL SHOT

As we INTERCUT the call:

                          SHARON
            Do you have a machine?

                           CATCH
            What?

                          SHARON
            Do you have an answering machine?

                           CATCH
            Yes.

                          SHARON
            Will you hang up please, and I'll
            call your machine.

                           CATCH
            Why?

She hangs up. He stares at the phone a moment,
bewildered. He hangs up, and his PHONE RINGS. He lets
it ring. His MACHINE comes on with no recording, only a
BEEP.

                          SHARON
            Hi. Maybe we can... have
            breakfast or something. I get up
            early and run in Ballard Park.
            There's a Denny's across from the
            park. Like eight or so. If
            you're there, you're there.

She hangs up, sighs a heavy one.

                           SHARON
            Oh, God.

And she falls back on her bed.


INT. DENNY'S - MORNING

Catch walks in, glances at the clock. It's 7 A.M. He's
nervous -- and excited. He takes a seat where he can
watch the park, the runners. He waits.


INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - MORNING

She has tossed and turned all night. She is awake,
turning to look at her clock-radio. It is 7:14. She
raises a hand over it.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                          45.

CONTINUED:

It changes to   7:15 and the RADIO COMES ON.    She slams her
hand down on   it, cutting it OFF. She lays    back and
heaves a sigh   that becomes a moan, sits up   again and
picks up the   phone, dials the number on the   tape.

                        SHARON
          Hi, don't pick up. Look, I didn't
          sleep much and anyway this is a
          bad idea. I was feeling funky
          last night and I'm all right now
          so let's just leave it where it's
          at. Bye. Oh, thanks for the...
          Bye.

She hangs up and lays back down and pounds her head into
the pillow and covers herself, even her head, with the
sheet.


INT. DENNY'S - MORNING

Catch is waiting, watching out the window.      It's 8:05,
until we...

                                                DISSOLVE TO:


INT. DENNY'S - MORNING

... and now it's 8:38, and Catch is still waiting and
watching.


INT. SHARON'S BEDROOM - MORNING

She is still in bed, under the sheet. Someone begins
KNOCKING on her door and she sits up, bleary and
frustrated.

                                SHARON
             Damn it!

She stumbles out of the bedroom to her door.

                                SHARON
             What?!     Who?!

                                CATCH (O.S.)
             It's me.

                                SHARON
             Oh, Jesus.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                          46.

CONTINUED:

She opens the door.    He wears a stern look.     She is not
apologetic.

                           SHARON
             I was just falling asleep.
             Finally.

                           CATCH
             We made a date.

                           SHARON
             It wasn't a 'date.'

                        CATCH
          Okay, an 'appointment.'     I keep my
          appointments.

She gives an exasperated moan and turns to stagger back
to bed. He closes the door and follows.

                          SHARON
          I called you.    I called you at
          seven.

                        CATCH
          I get up early. I walked there.
          I waited there.

                        SHARON
          Check your messages.

She heads for the bed, passing a     mirror, looking at her
rumpled self and groaning at the     sight.  She climbs into
bed and snuggles there and puts     the sheet over her head.
He is entering the bedroom. He      carries a Denny's take-
out bag.

                           SHARON
                    (under the sheet)
             I need more sleep. Come back in a
             month.

                           CATCH
             Come back? What makes you think
             I'd come back here?

The lump under the sheet says...

                           SHARON
             Then why are you here?

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                          47.

CONTINUED:

                           CATCH
             I'm here to tell you that when you
             tell someone you're going to be
             somewhere then that someone
             rearranges his life and you should
             be more aware of that and a lot
             more considerate instead of
             just...

She has come out from under the sheet and is watching
him.

                           SHARON
             What's in the bag?

                            CATCH
             What?   None of your business.

                           SHARON
             Did you bring some coffee?

                           CATCH
             You think you deserve coffee?

                           SHARON
             What else did you bring?   Food?

                           CATCH
                    (opening the bag)
             You definitely don't deserve food.
             I've got coffee, sugar, sweetener,
             non-dairy...

                            SHARON
             Just black.   Black. Thanks.

She sits up. He hands her the coffee.         She sips,
relishing the sip, then studies him.

                           SHARON
             So what kind of life did you
             rearrange in order to get to
             Denny's? You never said one word
             about yourself last night. What
             d'you do?

                           CATCH
             What's the difference?

                           SHARON
             What's the difference?! You're
             standing in my bedroom. That's
             the difference. Who are you?

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                         48.

CONTINUED:

                           CATCH
             Somebody who keeps appointments.

                           SHARON
             You're ducking. Don't duck.
                    (then a thought)
             Oh, shit -- you're married, right?

Convinced -- she picks up one of the throw pillows from
the bed and tosses it at him.

                           CATCH
             I'm not.

                           SHARON
             I don't believe you.

                           CATCH
             You don't believe me?   Give me
             back the coffee.

                           SHARON
             No.

                           CATCH
             Give me the coffee.

She hands him the coffee. He hits her with the pillow
and hands her back the coffee. He has made her smile,
but she continues, half teasing now.

                           SHARON
             Oh, God. Oh, wait -- you're
             involved in some criminal
             activity, aren't you? Great --
             That's all I need.

                           CATCH
             My name is Catch Lambert. I don't
             work. I don't commit any crimes.
             I like being with you. We can
             start from here -- from now.

                          SHARON
             Bullshit. I'm... I let you in
             here. I'm not going to be some
             fool. I need the details.

                           CATCH
             And I need to start from here.

                           SHARON
             That's ridiculous. Why?

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                        49.

CONTINUED:

                           CATCH
             That's the way it is.

                            SHARON
             Oh.   Your rules.

                            CATCH
             My rules.

                           SHARON
             Jesus. Okay. Fine. I don't
             really want to know you anyway.
             Goodbye.

He is conflicted -- but he won't relent. He walks to the
door. She stares, waiting. But he never turns around.
He walks out. She is mystified, exasperated. She hears
her FRONT DOOR CLOSE. She puts the coffee on her bed
table -- and finds herself staring at that damn rose.
She suddenly gets up and begins to dress hurriedly --
with a plan.


EXT. BOULEVARD - DAY

Sharon is driving, speeding a bit, getting to Catch's
building ahead of him.


EXT. CATCH'S BUILDING - DAY

He approaches his apartment building, unlocks the front
door, walks in the entrance area. Now we see, across the
street, Sharon exit her car and follow him.


EXT. BUILDING - DAY

The front door has locked automatically. Outside there
is a panel of buzzers and apartment numbers. Sharon hits
all the buttons. Somebody BUZZES her in.


INT. LOBBY - DAY

Sharon enters, looks at the elevators. It's not moving.
She goes to the stairs, listens, hears him TRUDGING UP
the stairway. She follows silently.


INT. HALLWAY - DAY

As Catch reaches his apartment door, unlocks it, opens it
and walks in.

                                                          50.

INT. CATCH'S APARTMENT - DAY

Before he can close the DOOR behind him, it BANGS open
wider, startling him -- and Sharon is in the doorway,
staring hard at him.

                         SHARON
                 (sarcastic)
          Can I come in?

She walks in and closes the door and starts looking
around as he says...

                          CATCH
          Yeah.   Sure.   Come in.

Despite his recent "decorating" the apartment is still
nearly empty. No books, magazines, photographs, no
clutter of life. She glances into the equally sterile
kitchen.

                        SHARON
          You live here? Nobody lives here.
          This place is some kind of front,
          a scam, a drop -- or what?

                        CATCH
          This is what you told me about --
          right?

                          SHARON
          What?

                        CATCH
          Your interrogation.      Do I need a
          lawyer?

He has made her look at herself, and take a breath.

                        SHARON
          I just don't want to be jerked
          around.

                          CATCH
          I'm not.

                        SHARON
          Then tell me straight out.      Who
          are you?

He is silent, and she starts to leave.     Moment of truth.

                        CATCH
          What is it you're looking for?

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                          51.

CONTINUED:

                             SHARON
             Your life.    I don't want any
             surprises.

                          CATCH
             This is it. I sleep here. I walk
             around town. That's all of it.

                           SHARON
             That's all of it?

                           CATCH
             Yeah. Except for you -- the way I
             feel about you.

                             SHARON
             Which is?

                             CATCH
             Surprising.    I thought it was
             impossible.    I thought I was...

                           SHARON
             You thought you were what?       Gay?

                            CATCH
             Dead.   In a way.

                           SHARON
             I'm supposed to understand that?

                           CATCH
             No. Did you ever wonder what
             'scratch' meant, when people say,
             'we'll start from scratch'? This
             is scratch. We can start from
             here.

She looks at him, looks at his empty place, his non-life,
and back at him again.

                             SHARON
             I don't know.    I just don't know.

She breaks off the stare and heads for the door.     He
watches her go.



EXT. UPSCALE NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY (SAME DAY)

As Catch charges up the stairs to the wide porch of Mrs.
Chu's well-kept home, carrying a grocery bag, head full
of his thoughts.

                                                         52.

INT. MRS. CHU'S HOME - DAY

As Catch enters. She is watching TV. He does glance
into the living room briefly to throw her a quick hello
smile, before moving to the kitchen. She SNAPS OFF the
TV and begins turning the photos face down as she sends
her voice to the kitchen.

                        ELANORA
          I remember that. That was a
          smile.


INT. KITCHEN - DAY

He is putting groceries away as she rolls into the room.
He doesn't look at her, tries to be casual, but his
thoughts are bubbling out.

                        CATCH
          You know the cop -- the woman cop?
          She... visited me.

Mrs. Chu registers surprise at this, but keeps it covered
and casual.

                         ELANORA
          Oh?   Where did she sit?

                        CATCH
          I have a chair now.

                        ELANORA
          You're... seeing her?

He darkens a bit as he works.

                        CATCH
          She has a lot of questions.    She
          wants to know everything.

                        ELANORA
          Of course she does. Everybody
          does.

                        CATCH
          We could start from today.    What's
          so wrong with that?

                        ELANORA
          Tell her.

The can in Catch's hand bangs on the cupboard, and he
stops, suddenly uptight.

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                        53.

CONTINUED:

                              CATCH
             Tell her what?

Mrs. Chu comes closer.

                           ELANORA
             Tell her, Catch. Tell somebody.
             It's been almost two years.

                              CATCH
                       (a warning)
             Nora...

                           ELANORA
             Every time I tell somebody, it
             gets a little bit easier. I'm not
             saying it goes...

His next warning is tough and absolute.

                              CATCH
             Nora!

She is silenced. The moment hangs. She rolls her chair
to him, takes a box of cookies out of his hand, opens the
box and eats one, defusing the moment.

                              ELANORA
             She nice?

He starts to work again.

                              CATCH
             She's tough.

                              ELANORA
             She pretty?

                           CATCH
             That doesn't matter.

                            ELANORA
                    (smiles)
             She is pretty.

                       CATCH
         She's sort of pissed-off at me.

                             ELANORA
         Apologize.

                             CATCH
         For what?

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                          54.

CONTINUED:

                           ELANORA
             It doesn't matter. We like it
             when men apologize.

He stares at her a while.

                           CATCH
             I'm sorry I yelled at you.

She smiles and hands him the box.

                              ELANORA
             Have a cookie.     See?


INT. POLICE REPORT ROOM - NIGHT

Sharon is typing at the computer, dark and dogged in her
work.  Lieutenant Sanderman is watching her through the
glass wall of the watch commander's office. He comes out
of the office and moves to where Sharon is typing.

                              SANDERMAN
             Sharon...

                           SHARON
                    (typing)
             Lieutenant...

We can see the   computer screen now. Sharon is searching
for any prior   record of "Catch Lambert" -- arrests,
convictions.    She has several "Carl Lamberts" on the
screen, even a   "Casper," no Catch.

                           SANDERMAN
             Anything bothering you?

                            SHARON
             Why?   What'd I do?

                           SANDERMAN
             Nothing. I'm talking about your
             general attitude lately.

Sharon stops typing.     She can find nothing.    She clears
the screen, sighs.

                           SHARON
             My attitude's fine. End of a long
             day. I'm tired.

                           SANDERMAN
             Family matters getting to you?

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                       55.

                              SHARON
             Family?!

                           SANDERMAN
             Your brother, Larry...

                           SHARON
             What about Larry?

                           SANDERMAN
             You know Nester -- on the Culver
             City P.D.? He went out on a
             violent domestic dispute
             yesterday. A neighbor called it
             in. It got a little ugly. No
             arrest -- a warning.

This hits her hard.

                              SHARON
             Larry.     Oh Christ.

                           SANDERMAN
             Nester said it's not the first
             time.

Sharon is quiet a while, taking it in, shaken by it.

                           SHARON
             Thanks for telling me.


EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET (CULVER CITY) - DAY (NEXT MORNING)

Sharon, not in uniform, is approaching Larry's house. It
has a small yard with kids' toys strewn about and a tire-
swing. She walks up on the porch and RINGS the DOORBELL.
She hears VOICES inside, LARRY AND KATHY, a quick
murmuring, low-voice argument, can't make out the words.
In a moment, Larry opens the door.

                           LARRY
             Jesus, you're up early.

                           SHARON
             I wanted to catch you before you
             went to work.

                           LARRY
             I thought you were on late shifts.

                           SHARON
             I don't sleep much. Can I come
             in?

                                                        56.

INT. LARRY'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY

The place is messy.    A TV can be heard -- CARTOONS.

                          LARRY
          What's up?

                          SHARON
          Where's Kath?

                        LARRY
          She's busy with Larry Jr. right
          now.

Sharon nods, but then walks past him.


INT. CHILD'S ROOM - DAY

As Sharon walks into this toy-strewn room. Larry Jr. is
sitting on the floor, watching a small TV. Kathy is not
with him. Sharon kneels beside the boy a moment.

                          SHARON
          Hey, Champ.

But he stays focused on the TV, some darkness, some
unsayable worry in his eyes. She picks up a toy car,
speaks softly.

                        SHARON
          Y'know, they call this one a woody
          'cause it has wood on the sides.

                          LARRY JR.
          I know.

Now he looks at her with sad and bottomless eyes. She is
hurting for him. Larry is now in the doorway. Sharon
kisses the child's head and walks out, passing her
brother.

                        LARRY
          Why'd you come by?

                          SHARON
          To see Kathy.


INT. HALLWAY

As Sharon heads for the master bedroom, Larry takes her
arm.

                        LARRY
          She's not feeling good.

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                         57.

Sharon pulls away from her brother.

                           SHARON
             I'll just say hello.


INT. BEDROOM - DAY

Sharon walks in. Kathy is sitting on the bed, her face
badly bruised. They stare. Kathy speaks quietly, her
eyes filling.

                           KATHY
             Don't make it worse.

                              SHARON
             It gets worse?

                           KATHY
             He's okay now. He's torn up about
             it. Don't make him mad.

Sharon moves closer. She reaches out, touches Kathy with
a comforting touch as the woman turns her bruised face
away.

                            SHARON
             When Larry and I were growing up,
             our mother said that all the time.
             'Don't make your father mad.'
                    (pause)
             Has he hit Larry Jr. yet?

                           KATHY
             He never would.

                            SHARON
             Oh.   Just you, huh?

Larry is in the doorway now, angry.

                           LARRY
             What d'you think you're doing in
             my house, Shar? In my home.

She walks out of the room and he follows her.


INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

She turns on him.

                            SHARON
             You see a pattern here, bro?

                           LARRY
             I lost my temper. Things got out
             of hand. It won't...

                           SHARON
             People always say that: 'I've got
             a temper.' Like it's an excuse.

                        LARRY
          I don't need a goddamn lecture.

She comes very close to him.

                       SHARON
         You want to hit someone?       Next
         time your 'temper' flares      up, Lar,
         and you just have to hit      somebody,
         you go home and hit your      father.

                       LARRY
         You blame everything on him.

                       SHARON
         I'm blaming you, you fucking
         coward.

He grabs her shirt hard.

                        LARRY
          You don't come in here...

He pushes her into the wall.

                        LARRY
          You don't come in here and call me
          names.

                         SHARON
          What do you call a man who uses
          his wife as a punching bag?
                  (pause)
          Coward.

He swings a slap at her. She blocks it and punches him
hard in the face, and he crashes down on the floor.
Kathy comes running, calling out...

                           KATHY
             Don't hurt her, Lar...!

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                       59.

CONTINUED:

Kathy sees that it's Larry on his ass. The little boy
comes out of his room. There is a surprised moment.
Then Kathy picks up the child and takes him back to his
room. Larry is sitting up, shaken, his nose bleeding.
Sharon goes close to him, rigid with fury.

                           SHARON
             I know how it feels, 'cause I
             remember. I remember standing
             between you and Dad and taking the
             blows for you -- and for what?!
             You turned out to be just like
             him, you bastard.
                    (pause)
             And so did I.

And she leaves the house and SLAMS the DOOR.


INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

She is just returning home after her shift, very tired,
drained. She absently turns ON the TV, the STEREO. She
notices a blinking light on her MESSAGE MACHINE and hits
the button.

                           LARRY (V.O.)
             I bet you feel real proud of
             yourself, Shar, knocking me down
             in front of my family. You know
             what I've got in my hand? I've
             got a Polaroid picture of my
             busted-up face, and I'm thinking
             of sending it to your department,
             to your lieutenant. I'm going to
             turn you in to the police, Shar,
             and see how you like it.

The message ends.     She stands there a moment.

                           SHARON
                    (quietly)
             Oh, God. Oh, shit.

She sits on the edge of a chair, worried, deep in her
thoughts, hitting bottom -- the darkness engulfing her.
In a moment, she looks at her desk, walks there, opens a
drawer, pulls out that piece of tape with Catch's number
on it -- but it is all stuck to itself. She hesitates,
then starts to pick it apart when a KNOCK at the door
makes her jump. She wonders, then, somehow, she knows.
She walks to the door.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                           60.

CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             It's you, right?

She unlocks   and opens the door, stares at Catch, very
vulnerable,   on the very edge, her pain and fear over
Larry just   under the surface. Catch holds a box of
cookies as   an offering.

                            SHARON
             Can you just shut up?    Just shut
             up and listen.

                           CATCH
             I didn't say anything.

                           SHARON
             I don't want to talk. I don't
             care if you have to play some game
             and pretend you're a... 'angel of
             mercy' or... whatever. I don't
             care, but I don't want to hear
             about it. All right? I don't
             want to hear anything.

She steps back, allowing him in, and closes the door and
turns to him.

                           SHARON
             It's a bad night.

He sees her pain and puts his arms around her, pushes
through his fear and holds her -- and she lays her head
on his chest. He embraces her fully, and the effect on
him goes deep, to his core, where there is both pain and
longing, but he holds on to her, even rocks her a bit.
She sighs. In a moment...

                           SHARON
             This is good... but I'm too tired
             to stand up anymore.

He walks her to the couch and has her sit, and then
slowly, gently, he "disarms" her. He lifts her leg,
takes the ankle holster and gun off, puts it on the
table. He turns her, takes the cuffs off her belt from
the middle of her back. He reaches into her pants pocket
and removes the Mace. From her shirt pocket he takes her
I.D. shield. He has her lie down on the couch now, their
faces close, eyes locked. They linger...

                           SHARON
             You want to kiss me?

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                       61.

CONTINUED:

He looks a little lost, but he nods, helpless. He comes
toward her lips -- finally -- but just before they touch,
she says, softly...

                           SHARON
             Kiss me someplace I've never been
             kissed.

He's not sure what to do. He begins to look her over --
as if hunting, and she gets a soft smile. He starts
slowly toward her ear -- but she shakes her head. Her
shirt is out of her belt and her midriff bare, and he
starts to move there, but checks her with a look. She
shakes her head. He hunts. Her smile deepens a bit. He
takes her hand and turns it over, going for the soft
flesh on the underside of her forearm, and she closes her
eyes. He kisses her there softly, and then again, and
then he lavishes kisses from her wrist to the underside
of her elbow as she sighs with pleasure and draws up her
knees in a kind of sensual glow that is leading them
to... No. He stops. She looks at him, a deep look, soft
voice.

                           SHARON
             Why do you stop? You always stop.

She has a glimpse of his mystery, the old sorrow, the
deep pain. He hugs her drawn-up knees, closing his eyes
a moment. Then he sits on the couch, puts a pillow on
his lap and raises her slightly, lays her head on the
pillow. He strokes her hair, her scalp as she closes her
eyes and sighs, slowly moving toward sleep. Our TRUMPET
MUSIC slides in here, lush and dreamy as we linger a
while, and then --

                                           SLOW DISSOLVE TO:


INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Just after dawn. Catch has slept on the couch. He is
beginning to awaken now as the first light strikes the
windows. The dreamy TRUMPET FADES OUT. Catch's eyes
clear, sleep replaced by thought, and he is suddenly
shaken by --


FLASHBACK - CATCH'S POV

-- a sliver of memory. But in this one, he is driving.
We see his hands on the wheel. Then his POV looks to the
side and we see an Asian-American woman seated beside
him, attractive, about his age. Her name is Annie. She
is saying something to him. We don't hear the words.
When the FLASHBACK ENDS --

                                                        62.

BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT)

Catch sits up on the couch, jolted.   He gets another
sudden --


FLASHBACK - HEADLIGHTS

glaring through his windshield, blinding him. He gasps,
sitting there on the couch, but it's all over. He
stands, rattled, and he moves toward Sharon's bedroom.


INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

Sharon is peacefully asleep. He stands over her with
troubled eyes, but this slowly changes to a loving look.
He bends close to her face. He feels her breath on him.
He wants to lie down with her -- but he raises a hand and
very gently brushes her cheek. She stirs. He does it
again. She sighs a peaceful sigh, opens her eyes. He
smiles at her.

                          CATCH
          New day.


EXT. BOULEVARD - DAY

Sharon is driving Catch home. They are now on a main
boulevard of stores, office buildings. They stop at a
light. Both are surprised by a voice calling out from
the pedestrians crossing the street.

                          PINDELLA (O.S.)
          Catch?

They look up to see a well-dressed man pausing in the
middle of the crosswalk to face their car. He is in his
forties, tall, with grey-blond hair. This is RICHARD
PINDELLA. He has a small smile and wave for Catch.
Sharon is curious, looking at Catch. Catch throws the
man a dark look and then turns away, ignoring him,
nervous, intense.

                          PINDELLA
          Catch?

                        CATCH
                 (to Sharon)
          Drive, will you?

Pindella is moving toward the car, Sharon watching him,
wondering.

                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                         63.

CONTINUED:

                             CATCH
             Drive!

The light changes. Pindella hurries to the curb as the
cars surge forward. Sharon drives slowly, checking the
mirror to see Pindella stare after them -- then enter the
office building on the corner.

                        CATCH
          Will you get off this street?

She makes a turn, glancing at Catch.

                             SHARON
          What?       You owe him money?

But his dark look persists, and he doesn't answer.
Then...

                        CATCH
          If you take a right and stop -- we
          can walk from here. I'd rather
          walk.

He is nervous, being in the car -- and glad to leave it
when she pulls over. She watches this, wondering.


EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

Sharon exits the car and locks it, staring at Catch.

                        SHARON
          If you're in trouble...

                             CATCH
             I'm not.

                           SHARON
             If you're in trouble with him,
             maybe I can help.

                           CATCH
             Forget about him. Somebody I used
             to know. I don't want to know him
             anymore. That's all. Forget
             about it. Walk with me.

She hesitates,    then falls in   beside him as he walks on.
They walk along    in silence,   the neighborhood growing more
seedy, tougher    as they go.    Catch is relaxing now, trying
to push it all    away. Sharon    looks around her.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                           64.

CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             This is not a great place to walk.

                           CATCH
             I like it here. It's fine.

                            SHARON
             I work here.   It's not fine.

                           CATCH
             What's the problem?

                           SHARON
             Besides the shootings, break-ins,
             rapes, cart thefts? We've got a
             loose dog raiding garbage cans,
             knocking 'em over. Can't catch
             him. Got somebody blowing a
             trumpet between midnight and
             three. Can't find him.

As someone approaches them, Catch makes eye contact and
smiles a small, friendly smile-in-passing. He gets a
brief smile in return. He and Sharon amble on. He does
it again.

                           SHARON
             You know everybody here?

He nods to another YOUNG MAN he's never met...

                           CATCH
             How's it goin'?

                           YOUNG MAN
             Goin' uphill, man.

Catch and Sharon smile.

                           CATCH
                    (to Sharon)
             You try it.

                            SHARON
             Try what?

                          CATCH
             Go ahead. We need this.
             Everybody.

She has misgivings. A young woman is bustling along.
Sharon makes eye contact and presents a nervous smile and
a nod -- but the woman looks at her sternly and bustles
on.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                             65.

CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             I feel like a jerk. I feel like a
             smiley face.

Catch smiles, Sharon frowns, but when an OLD MAN passes,
she gives a small smile. The Man lights up.

                              OLD MAN
             Mornin'.

Catch looks at her. She tries to shrug it off, but can't
quite hide her pleasure. Now Catch is pausing as a woman
is walking her six-year-old daughter to their parked car.

Catch makes eye contact with the girl and does a goofy
wave that makes her smile. Sharon smiles, too. As the
girl's MOTHER is unlocking the car, the girl shyly looks
back at Catch for more fun. He does that quick finger
trick -- trying to catch his own thumb, and the girl
giggles But the Mother is impatient.

                              MOM
             Go on.

The girl gets in. The Mother is about to close the door.
She frowns, mean-eyed.

                              MOM
             Move your arm!

The girl slides in further,         and the Mother slams the
door. The girl follows her          mother with hurt eyes as she
walks around to the driver's         side. Catch has paused to
watch this, his eyes gentle         on the girl. The Mother is
about to enter the car when         she sees Catch staring.

                           MOM
             What are you staring at?

                           CATCH
             She feels bad 'cause you yelled at
             her.

                          MOM
             What?! Who the hell do you think
             you are?

Sharon is uncomfortable.       Catch persists, never flinching
at the woman's anger.

                        CATCH
          She just needs you to smile at
          her.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                           66.

CONTINUED:

                           MOM
             It's none of your business!

                           CATCH
             Why not smile at her?   What's it
             cost?

                           MOM
             Who the hell are you to talk to
             me?!

Catch's anger is like flint in his eyes.         It surprises
Sharon. She's upset by this.

                           CATCH
             You're so damn impatient.

                           WOMAN
             Get away from me!

                           CATCH
             You're so busy being pissed off,
             and time is going by.

                           WOMAN
             What?!

                           CATCH
             It's not her fault.

The Woman gets into the car and slams the door.

                           WOMAN
             I'm calling the police!

                            CATCH
             No.  I'm calling the police.
                    (turns to Sharon)
             Hey -- police.

The Woman speeds her car away.       Sharon gets in Catch's
face.

                           SHARON
             Jesus Christ, Catch.

                           CATCH
             Maybe she'll think about it now.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

         You had no right to do that. God!

         Who the hell are you, some expert
         on raising kids?! The
         neighborhood angel?! Jesus!

                       CATCH
         No. No, I just... some people are
         walking around blind...

         That's not your problem!

         Okay, fine -- you tell me what it
         is!

         Maybe it's not my problem. Maybe
         it's your problem. Maybe you're
         going around blind.

          Blind to what's going on around
          you. Blind to what people need.
          We're supposed to take care of
          each other. We're supposed to
          keep each other safe. That's the
          way it should be -- if you're not
          going around blind, like that
          woman...

                           SHARON
             Or like me, right? What about
             you? How come you can see?

That stops him, the darkness rising.    He looks about,
trying to contain it.

                        CATCH
          I think I'll... walk the rest of
          the way on my own.

                           SHARON
          Yeah.    Fine.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                         68.

CONTINUED:

                           CATCH
             I'll call you later -- about the
             hiking.

                             SHARON
             I'll be out.

She turns and walks away.      He is still angry, but sorry
to see her go.

                             CATCH
             Shar... wait.    Hey!

But she   keeps walking, and he watches her walk away.
Then he   walks on, upset, mad at himself, trying to pound
through   it, walking quickly. He is passing an alley,
when he   hears a CRASH. He looks in...


EXT. ALLEY - DAY

He sees a large dog that has just knocked over a garbage
can. He and the dog stare. Catch walks into the alley,
approaches the big dog, squats down to look the animal in
the eye, and begins petting it. The big mutt is now
leaning into the petting, and Catch's eyes go deep -- and
slowly find their way to a sad smile.


EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

Sharon and Robby    are patrolling in their unit. Robby is
driving. Sharon     is watching out the window with a deep-
eyed look, a bit    down because of her argument with Catch.
She is staring as    she rolls along.


SHARON'S POV

She is watching the people on the street, NOTICING, for
once, just how isolated they are, each in a box, passing
without connecting.


ON SHARON

watching.


INT. CATCH'S APARTMENT - LATER THAT DAY

We've never seen the apartment flooded by sunlight like
this, all blinds open.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                        69.

CONTINUED:

We START in the kitchen, staring at the drawer that is
now so loaded with toys, it won't shut. Some brightly-
painted soldiers are sticking out of the drawer.

In the living room there are two chairs now, and more
lamps and tables. Our PAN REVEALS that the dog from the
alley is sitting in the living room, watching Catch --
whom we now see is hanging a picture on the wall -- a
mountain scene. He holds the picture in one place, then
moves it to another, wondering. His fight with Sharon
still colors his mood, but he's working through it.

                           CATCH
             Do we go for... symmetry? Or...
             more off-center. Japanese.

He glances at the dog as he moves the picture.

                           CATCH
             Are you into this? Bob?

The dog watches him.


EXT. LARRY'S HOUSE - EVENING

It is early evening of the same day, and Sharon is just
off shift, out of uniform in her own car, parking on
Larry's street and walking to the door. She knocks --
and takes a step back. Larry opens the door, already
angry, his nose bandaged, eyes blackened a bit from the
blow.

                           LARRY
             I don't want you around here.

                           SHARON
             Let's go talk in the yard.

They stare. She starts walking back into his darkening
front yard, looking over her shoulder. She walks to a
tree where the tire swing hangs, waits there. He goes
back inside, but leaves the door open. In a moment he
reappears, coming outside, closing the door behind him.


ON SHARON AND LARRY

As they meet by the tire swing.    His eyes burn her, hate
and pain.

                           SHARON
             You took a swing at me.

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                          70.

CONTINUED:

                           LARRY
             You asked for it -- calling me a
             coward. You knew I'd swing. You
             think I look bad now? Look at
             this.

He has a Polaroid photo in his hand, holds it in front of
her, dried blood and bad bruising on his face.

                           LARRY
             Nice, huh? Beautiful. The
             cops'll love this, right?
             Evidence. Don't you guys love
             evidence?

He puts it in his pocket, and they stare a moment more.

                           LARRY
             You wanted me to swing.

She looks away.     She nods, speaks softly.

                           SHARON
             I'm sorry I hit you so hard.

                           LARRY
             But you're not sorry you hit me.

                           SHARON
             Jesus, Larry, what about Kathy's
             face?!

                        LARRY
          That's not your business! Nobody
          called you, right? She didn't ask
          for you to come here. This is my
          family. You don't get it, 'cause
          you've got no family. Nobody. So
          you try to run everybody else's
          life. Jesus Christ -- get your
          own life. That's the goddam
          problem. Get your own goddamn
          life.

Their stare holds, but she is giving way.

                        SHARON
          Okay. I'm sorry I came here.       I'm
          sorry I hit you. Okay?

                           LARRY
          Okay what?

This is very hard for her.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                         71.

CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             Don't go to my department, all
             right?

                           LARRY
             Why the hell not?

                           SHARON
             Larry...

                           LARRY
             Why not?!

                           SHARON
             Because the job's all I got.

                        LARRY
          That's what I said, right?    No
          life.

She nods, her voice smaller, almost a whisper.

                        SHARON
          That's what you said.

He makes her wait, thinking it over.

                        LARRY
          And you won't come around here.
          You won't call. Ever.

In a moment Sharon nods.

                           LARRY
             And I don't want you to come to
             Mom and Dad's celebration...

Her eyes snap to his, surprised.

                           LARRY
             Not the church. Not the party.
             Stay away. I don't want you
             around. I don't want to see you,
             Shar.

After another moment, she nods again -- and he snatches
the photo out of his shirt pocket and pushes it against
her chest and walks away. The photo falls to the ground.
Larry says without turning...

                              LARRY
             Go get a life.

... and she snaps.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                          72.

CONTINUED:

                             SHARON
             I got a life!

The words burst out of her, thick with tears, but she's
not crying. Larry stops and turns.

                           SHARON
             How the hell would you know about
             my life?!

                             LARRY
             I know.

                        SHARON
          You know nothing about me, because
          you don't want to know. The
          family doesn't want to know me.
          Well, too bad. Sharon's got a
          life. Sharon's got a boyfriend.
          Sharon's going hiking in the
          morning with her boyfriend. She's
          not sitting alone miserable like
          you want. Too bad!

She reaches down, snatches the Polaroid photo off the
ground, walks to her car, enters and slams the door as
hard as it is possible to slam it.


EXT. SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS - DAY

Moving through the panorama are two small figures on a
hiking trail, traveling uphill on a ridge.


ON SHARON, CATCH

Sharon is pounding along, barely out of breath. She
studies the beautiful view, and it helps her. It lifts
her. Catch is falling behind, breathing heavily.

                           CATCH
             Hey. Hey!   Can you wait up a
             minute?!

She waits.     He catches up.

                           SHARON
             I thought you walked all over the
             city.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                          73.

CONTINUED:

                           CATCH
                    (gasping)
             The city is flat. Okay? Can we
             stop here? Can we examine the
             view? Have a Milky Way? I've
             burned every calorie I ever had.

But she walks on.

                           SHARON
             My favorite lunch spot is another
             half mile.

                            CATCH
             Up?!

She smiles and walks on, and he follows, calling out.

                           CATCH
             I'm not one of those competitive
             guys, you know!


EXT. POND - DAY (BIT LATER)

Sharon is already unpacking their lunch as Catch trudges
up and collapses near a stream-fed pond. She hands him a
sandwich, but he shakes his head.

                           CATCH
             No thanks. I can't eat and have a
             heart attack at the same time.

She smiles again and takes a bite and stares off, and
soon enough her dark thoughts come and cover her, and
Catch notices.

                           CATCH
             As soon as you get happy, you get
             sad.

                            SHARON
             I'm okay.   Everything's code four.

                           CATCH
             Everything's what?

                           SHARON
             Everything's fine.

                           CATCH
             Fine? This isn't fine. I know
             fine. This is something else.
             Something happened yesterday.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                          74.

CONTINUED:

                            SHARON
             Yesterday -- you mean you want to
             hear about it?

                           CATCH
             Sure I do.

                           SHARON
             No kidding. Why? You never talk
             about yesterday.

                           CATCH
             All my days are the same.

He keeps staring, waiting. She is chewing a sandwich,
looking at him. Finally, she begins -- with no emotion.

                           SHARON
             Yesterday. Okay. Yesterday we
             rolled on a 415. Juliette and
             Sanchez had these four guys
             against a wall, but they were
             H.D.B. and definitely unco-op. It
             got pretty jumpy, but we got them
             in the car with a couple of
             bruises and Robby got a sprained
             wrist, so I did the rest of the
             shift with a rookie who lost it
             over a D.B. in Sunset Park, old
             woman who'd been dead maybe six,
             seven days, and I usually do all
             right but the smell got to me, and
             I can still smell her. Then we
             arrested a prostitute working out
             of her home, and I carried her
             little girl out to the social
             worker, and the kid was holding on
             real tight and making my shoulder
             wet and I wanted to punch her
             rock-head mother, and then shift
             ended and I had a nice visit with
             my brother Larry.

He is staring at her.     He takes her hands, holds them.

                           CATCH
                    (softly)
             I'm sorry. That would make
             anybody sad.

                           SHARON
             Sorry you asked?

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                          75.

CONTINUED:

                            CATCH
             No.   No, you can always tell me.

She stares a moment, then speaks with an irony he doesn't
pick up on.

                           SHARON
             Well... I feel better now.    You
             feel better?

                            CATCH
             I feel fine.   Great.

He takes off his T-shirt and begins stripping off his
shorts, his underwear!

                           SHARON
             What are you doing?!

She is surprised, smiling, as he plunges into the pond,
her darkness dissipating.

                           SHARON
             Catch! There's no swimming here!
             And you can't be naked in a state
             park!

He dives under and surfaces again.

                           CATCH
             Take the day off, Pogo!

                           SHARON
             What if a park ranger comes?!

He dives and surfaces once more.       We STAY CLOSE ON him.

                           CATCH
             Take your badge off for once.
             Don't be such a damn Marine about
             everything. Just...

He stops because she isn't there. He looks about. Then
suddenly he sees her, poised on a boulder right above
him, in her underwear about to dive! He yelps and gets
out of her way, and she dives off the rock in classic,
near-professional form, a beautiful, sleek dive. She
hits the water just right and surfaces, and they splash
and swim and frolic and dunk each other in unabashed
play.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                           76.

CONTINUED:

At one point she jumps at him to dunk him, and he catches
her. They are in chest-deep water and their faces are
close. They pause -- then she goes in for a kiss, but he
pulls his head back, avoiding that kiss and says...

                           CATCH
             Someplace I've never been kissed.

She smiles, staring, then slowly reaches her hands to his
face, gently closes his eyes and is about to kiss him on
the closed lids, but she changes her mind and instead
puts her lips tenderly on each of the small scars on his
face. Then she moves away. He opens his eyes. She
walks to the shore, moves to her clothes and starts
getting dried and dressed, giving him a soft look.

Catch comes to the shore    to dry himself, but as he
dresses, Sharon glances    at his body -- and the scarring
on his chest and arms.     He is troubled about this,
avoiding her eyes. Then     he makes a decision.

                            CATCH
             They tell me I was in an accident.
             Long time ago.

                           SHARON
             Looks like a bad one.

                           CATCH
             I don't remember it.    I...

She waits -- but he says no more. She continues        to
dress, sliding her shorts over her wet underwear       -- but
before she puts her shirt on, she turns her back       to take
off her wet bra. He glances at her. She looks         over and
catches him glancing. They both smile softly,
ironically, as they finish dressing.

                           SHARON
             We should be thinking about lunch.
             We have to pack up.

                           CATCH
             So soon?

                            SHARON
             Some of us have to work.
                    (teasing)
             You ever work?

                          CATCH
         Yeah.     I worked.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                            77.

CONTINUED:

                            SHARON
             Oh?   You remember that?   Working?

She smiles and walks off toward the food. He stares
after her, his smile fading into thoughtfulness, memory,
as he dresses.


EXT. COFFEE HOUSE - DAY

Catch is standing outside, looking in through the large
window, searching. His eyes settle on a man, and he
stares. The man, about his age, is having coffee and
reading the paper. Catch is staring deeply, mustering
his courage. He walks into the place.


INT. COFFEE HOUSE - DAY

Catch hesitates, then walks over and stands beside this
man until he -- JACK MOLINA -- looks up. Jack beams with
recognition and surprise.

                           JACK
             Catch -- Jesus!

Catch is held back, smiling a bit, but on thin ice here,
dipping into his past.

                          JACK
             How are you? Sit down. Been
             years. You been out of town?

                        CATCH
                 (sitting)
          I've been around.

Jack's smile clouds as memory kicks in.

                        JACK
          Oh, man, I'm really sorry about
          what happened. I never got a
          chance to say...

Catch, with a steady look, says...

                        CATCH
          We don't need to go there.

Jack nods a moment.

                           JACK
             Okay. All right. So... what
             d'you want, a coffee?

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                         78.

CONTINUED:

                            CATCH
             I want my old job back.
                    (pause)
             What d'you think?

                           JACK
             You been workin'?

                           CATCH
             No, but I'm up to speed.

                           JACK
                    (thinks)
             Well, it's not good with Randal
             anymore.

                           CATCH
             No?

                           JACK
             No, he's out of it, but Danny
             Coley's got something going.
             Wanna go see 'im?

Catch stares, nods.

                           CATCH
             Finish your coffee.


EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY (LATER SAME DAY)

In a seedy parking lot, tough part of town, Robby and
Sharon are arresting two teenage girls. One of them is
leaning on the car as Sharon searches her. Robby stands
back with the other (cuffed) girl. Robby is staring at
Sharon through this moment -- noting the difference in
her, still very professional -- but softer. The girl is
upset, near tears. Sharon is gentle in her search.

                           SHARON
             I have to check these jacket
             pockets. What's your name --
             Allison?

The girl nods, not trusting her voice.

                           SHARON
             I need to unsnap this, Allison.
             I'm checking your waistband. You
             got to Whitney School?

                           ALLISON
             St. Mark's.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                        79.

CONTINUED:

Sharon is searching, Robby is noting all this, his eyes
appreciating the difference.

                           SHARON
             Lift your arms higher. Got a good
             basketball team at St. Mark's.
             You play basketball?


EXT. STREET - NIGHT (LATER THAT NIGHT)

Sharon and Robby are still on the job, their unit rolling
down a residential street of apartment buildings. A
parked car is BLASTING MUSIC, and Robby halts beside it.
Sharon starts making dancing moves to the MUSIC, sitting
there beside Robby, and he stares at her as she grooves,
kidding it. Then Robby HITS the HORN to get the driver's
attention in the parked car. Robby makes a gesture to
lower the volume, and the man SNAPS OFF his TAPE. Robby
rolls on, glancing at Sharon. She wears a small smile,
checking their beat.

                        ROBBY
          What's going on, Pogo?    You're not
          happy or anything?

                        SHARON
          Well, it's a mix, Robby. Life is
          shit, but I'm dating this great
          dead guy.

She smiles at Robby's look.

                            SHARON
             He says before I came along, he
             thought he was dead. Sounds
             better when he says it --
                     (stops abruptly)
             Listen.

                           ROBBY
             What?

                           SHARON
             Shhh.   Sh!

Robby stops the unit, rolling the windows down.     They
hear the FARAWAY SOUND of...

                           SHARON
             The trumpet player.

Robby pulls over.

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                        80.

CONTINUED:

                           ROBBY
             This time we got his ass.

They exit the car and stand in the street, looking up,
scanning the dark buildings -- but the sound is hard to
track, a FAINT BALLAD on a skillful HORN.

                             SHARON
             Wow.

                             ROBBY
             Got 'im?

                           SHARON
             Look at that moon.

They stare at the full moon. In a moment, we hear the
sound of ROARING CARS, their TIRES SCREECHING as they
turn onto this street, one car speeding ahead to cut off
the other and force it to stop. The two male drivers are
screaming at each other. Robby shakes his head.

                           ROBBY
             Full moon, man. Hey!

They run toward the drivers who are exiting their cars to
confront each other. One big guy carries a baseball bat.
Robby heads off one DRIVER while Sharon intercepts the
BAT-MAN.

                           DRIVER
             This guy's crazy!

                           BAT-MAN
             This asshole side-swiped me!

                           SHARON
             Are you McGuire?

                             BAT-MAN
             What?!

                             SHARON
             Mark McGuire?

                             BAT-MAN
             No.

                           SHARON
             Then put that bat away.   Put it in
             your trunk. Now.

The man hesitates, then moves toward his trunk.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                            81.

CONTINUED:

                           DRIVER
             I never touched his car.

                        BAT-MAN
          You lying bastard!

The man charges, bat in hand, and Sharon makes a flying
tackle, bringing him down hard on the street -- and we
immediately...

                                                  CUT TO:


INT. SHARON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (LATER)

as she lies on the bed, on her stomach, her top off, and
Catch straddles her, massaging her back and shoulder
which are sore from her tackle.

                              SHARON
          Ow.     Ow!

                              CATCH
         Sorry.

                          SHARON
         No.     That's good. Deeper.

                       CATCH
                (as he works)
         How heavy was this guy?

                              SHARON
         Like a truck.

                          CATCH
         God.     Tractor-trailer?

                              SHARON
         Pickup.        Ow.   Ow! That's really
         good.

She begins to moan as he digs out the pain. He is
fighting against the erotic charge of this, trying to
keep it medicinal, but he's got his hands all over her
naked back, and she is moaning -- so he stops and takes a
breath.

                           CATCH
             I better... More oil.

He reaches to the bed table and puts oil on his hands,
noticing a card that stands open on the tabletop, a very
pretty invitation.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                             82.

CONTINUED:

                           CATCH
             This is pretty.

                           SHARON
             Don't get oil on it.

                           CATCH
             Renewal of vows -- that's great.
             Is this your parents?

                          SHARON
             Yes. Just put it down.   I'm not
             going.

                           CATCH
             Why not?

She doesn't answer. He puts it down, comes back to the
slow rubbing of her shoulders, her neck. In a moment...

                           SHARON
             If I go, my brother'll hurt    me
             with the department. I got     mad
             and knocked him down. All     they
             need is a complaint. Just     leave
             it alone and keep rubbing.     Okay?

She moans in pleasure as he rubs, trying to push all
other thoughts away.

                           CATCH
             So... he says you can't go?

                           SHARON
             Can't you rub without talking?
                    (then)
             It's been bad with my family a
             long time, so the hell with it
             anyway. If they don't want me
             there, I don't want to be there.
             All right?

                           CATCH
             All right.
                    (then, as he works)
             Bad how?

                           SHARON
             Oh, Jesus!

But we see her eyes turn inward toward the old pain and,
for once, she shares it.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                          83.

CONTINUED:

                             SHARON
             My father used to knock us around,
             all of us. But I'm the one who
             called the cops -- finally.
                     (pause)
             They say I turned against the
             family.

Catch works in silence a while, absorbing this, looking
at Sharon with more tenderness than ever. In a moment...

                           CATCH
             But... they invited you.

                           SHARON
             You don't know anything about it.
             So forget it.

                           CATCH
             Well... I know about family.

                            SHARON
             Oh, yeah?   What about it?

                           CATCH
             It's... a door you don't close.

                           SHARON
             I didn't close the door.

                           CATCH
             You're closing it now. Right?
             Family invites you, you go.
             Family shows up, you welcome them
             in. That's family.

                          SHARON
             Oh, sure. What if they don't
             deserve it?

                           CATCH
             Then you forgive.

                           SHARON
             You have all the answers.

                           CATCH
             No. I just... It seems like a
             chance, doesn't it? A chance to
             make things right. I'd take it.
             Then you tried -- y'know? And
             it's up to them.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                       84.

CONTINUED:

Sharon is considering his words, but she's also deep in
her old pain, defensive, challenging.

                           SHARON
             You close with your family?

That hits him, but he keeps rubbing her, gentle now,
looking a little lost. He doesn't answer.

                          SHARON
          See?    So why should I listen to
          you?

But as he works her back in silence, we see her facing
her pain and thinking through it.


INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - NEXT MORNING

Just after dawn. Catch is on the couch, stirring in his
sleep, in the grip of an unsettling dream. We hear what
he hears: the VOICES of his wife, his son, murmurings.
We're not sure of the words, even laughter. Catch's eyes
snap open, jolted out of sleep, but the VOICES don't
stop, and he suddenly sits up. The VOICES FADE as he
catches his breath, gulping air. He tries to calm down.
In a moment, he rises and moves to Sharon's bedroom.


INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

He comes to the side of the bed and sees that she is
asleep. He sits on the bed and studies her, his dark
thoughts dissipating as he watches her sleep, his eyes
going deep. In a moment he begins to raise a hand to
brush her cheek -- the way awakened her before -- but he
stops before touching her. Instead, he brings his face
close to her and lightly kisses her.

She stirs. He kisses her again. She opens her eyes.
They stare at each other. She raises a limp hand and
touches his face. He begins to come close, slowly, for
another kiss. She welcomes it. They kiss on the mouth,
very tenderly. They kiss again -- deeper. They kiss
again, and she holds him, and he moves fully onto the
bed, lying over her and supporting his weight on his
elbows and kissing and kissing and letting go for once,
hungry for her because she is in his heart now, and she
is a salvation, and there is a moment when they both
pause and stare clear-eyed, acknowledging what they are
doing, and both of them abandon their fear and pain and
begin to smile, and they make love that way, smiling, as
we slowly...

                                              DISSOLVE TO:

                                                        85.

INT. BLUES CLUB - NIGHT

The night of that same day finds us at this neighborhoody
place with a lot of down-to-earth atmosphere and not a
lot of noise, like Harvell's in Santa Monica -- earthy
blues and jazz from a small band in a darkish club, small
dance floor. We PAN during this slow number and ARRIVE
AT a few dancing couples, including Sharon and Catch who
mostly just hold each other and sway. When their eyes
meet, there is a lot of deep pleasure there.

The music ends. The small crowd applauds. Couples head
back to the tables, but the little band goes right into a
more up-tempo but still earthy blues. Sharon stops and
pulls Catch back onto the dance floor. He smiles and
follows.

This number has a driving beat, and, slowly, we watch
Sharon drop her inhibitions and become more and more   free
out there, and Catch is smiling and wowed by her, and   she
laughs, wowing herself, and she keeps going, getting   wild
and playful, and it's something to see. We LINGER ON    the
joy and abandon. She's earned it. They go a little
crazy, happy crazy, and in a while we...

                                              DISSOLVE TO:


SAME - HOURS LATER

The blues club is emptying out. It's late. The band is
finishing what seems to be its last number, for the last
of thinning crowd -- including a tired, happy Sharon and
Catch who applaud the end of the number. Catch stares at
her.

                        CATCH
          What's your favorite song?

He rises -- as if to go to the band with a request.     She
smiles, spent.

                        SHARON
          Catch, I'm beat. So are they.   I
          think they're finished.

                         CATCH
          One more.   It's a surprise.

She watches as he leaves her, walks to the bandstand.     He
talks to the leader who is the PIANO PLAYER.


SHARON'S POV

From the instrument cases on the floor behind the piano,
Catch picks up a trumpet case, opens it. Now Sharon's
tired smile is changing to curiosity, wonder.

                                                       86.

ON CATCH

As he puts the mouthpiece on the horn, nervous, but
excited, too, speaking to the Piano Player.

                             CATCH
            Thanks, Danny.

                          DANNY (PIANO PLAYER)
            Gonna be good having you back,
            Catch.

Catch comes to the edge of the bandstand, grinning a bit
at Sharon, at his surprise for her, nervously fingering
the horn. He puts it to his lips.


ON SHARON

Mouth-open surprise -- and then smiling with the wonder -
- and Catch begins to play, closing his eyes and
rendering a ballad, like the haunting "ANGEL EYES."

Sharon's smile slowly fades, replaced by a much deeper
look, not only because he is so good, but because he is
showing her his heart, his love and even his pain -- more
than he can show her any other way. We INTERCUT as he
opens his eyes briefly, watching her, sending her the
music, closing his eyes again to fall into the song -- as
Sharon's eyes fill at the beauty and sadness of it, and
at this look inside her man. We LINGER. Then...

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. CLUB - NIGHT

We keep the sound of CATCH'S TRUMPET going as he and
Sharon exit the club and begin to stroll away, arms
around each other. In a moment, he stops. He can't go
another step. He has to kiss her. He holds her face and
comes in for the kiss, and above the music we hear her
say softly.

                          SHARON
            Where I've never been kissed.

He stops and stares a moment, then takes her hand and
walks her out into the middle of the traffic-less
boulevard and there, in the center of the street, kisses
her, and she responds, and it is their finest, fullest
moment, lifting on the MUSIC, and it is ironic and
prophetic that at its peak they are washed over by the
revolving light from a police car and a SIREN that CHIRPS
once as they break, staring.

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                        87.

CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             Oh, God.

We WIDEN to see Ray and Sanchez in their police unit 20
feet away. Ray uses a small electronic bullhorn to
say...

                           RAY
             Are you in danger there?

                           SHARON
             Go away.

                           RAY
             I was talking to him, Pogo.

                        CATCH
          No thanks, Ray. Everything's code
          four. Go away.

Sharon laughs aloud and walks (with Catch in hand) to the
police car, her joy overwhelming any embarrassment. She
gestures behind them at the jazz club.

                        SHARON
          See that place? He's going to be
          playing there every weekend.

Catch notes the pride with which she says this.

                        RAY
                 (impressed; to Catch)
          Oh, yeah? What d'you play?

                        SHARON
          It's music, Ray. You wouldn't
          like it.

She waves and walks off with Catch, arms around each
other. The cops watch them go.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:


INT. CATCH'S BEDROOM - DAY (NEXT MORNING)

Sharon is asleep, alone in the tousled bed.


INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING

Catch is dressed, putting a leash on Bob, glancing into
the bedroom at Sharon.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                     88.

CONTINUED:

There is love in his look, and then a passing question,
too, a residue of fear now that their relationship has
begun in full -- but it all ends up in a soft smile for
her as he walks Bob to the door. He hesitates at the
door -- then walks into the kitchen and slides open that
drawer of toys, stares at them.


INT. BEDROOM - MORNING (MINUTES LATER)

Sharon is waking, sleepy. She rises, finds a robe and
slips it on, calling out softly for Catch.


INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING

Sharon sees that Catch and Bob are gone. She drifts to
the window, looks at the day, looks down at the street --
and she sees them.


SHARON'S POV

She sees Catch and Bob on their way into the park across
the street from the building.


ON SHARON

She smiles and moves into the bedroom to dress.


EXT. CITY PARK - DAY (MINUTES LATER)

Catch is walking Bob in the park, but is also checking
for someone, studying the playground. He begins walking
toward the swings.


ANGLE - SANDBOX

Tommy, Catch's neighbor, is playing in the sand with a
metal truck. Catch walks up to Tommy, carrying a bulging
plastic bag -- but Tommy's attention is on Bob, and pets
the big, friendly dog.


ANGLE - CANDACE

She sits on a bench nearby, watching this, smiling a bit.

                                                     89.

ON CATCH, TOMMY

Catch kneels in the sand, beside the boy, and he spills
out the contents of the bag -- action figures,
superheroes, soldiers. Tommy goes wide-eyed at the
array. Catch is pleased by the boy's reaction. Catch
keeps a layer of emotion covered here.

                         CATCH
           You like these?

                         TOMMY
           Yeah!

                         CATCH
           Well... They're for you. We can
           pretend it's your birthday.

Tommy stares at him, then back at the toys in delight.
Candace is walking toward them, and Catch turns to her.

                         CATCH
           I hope you don't mind.

                         TOMMY
           They're for me, Mom!

Her look of surprise questions him.

                        CATCH
           Yeah. I've... kind of been saving
           them up.

                         CANDACE
           For Tommy?

He nods. She kneels close to her boy, the toys, pleased
but not quite knowing what to say.

                         CANDACE
           Well, thank you. Thanks a lot.

Catch nods, grins at Tommy who is already at play with
the figures.


ANGLE - SHARON

She has entered the park and witnessed this from a
distance. She is angling toward the playground.


ON CATCH

He watches Tommy at play with the figures, but it's
almost too much for him. He touches the boy and rises,
smiles and nods at Candace and begins to walk off.

                                                           90.

ON SHARON

She hurries her steps to intersect with Catch.


ON CANDACE, TOMMY

                          CANDACE
            Wow, Tommy -- Look at them all.
            Did you say thank you?

Now Tommy looks up. Catch is moving away with Bob,
walking home. Tommy stands up, Candace calls out to stop
Catch.

                             CANDACE
            Excuse me!


ON CATCH

But he is walking on, some of the emotion seeping
through, not darkness, some old joy welling up. We see,
in b.g., Tommy starts to run after him to say thanks. We
now have a convergence of Tommy, Sharon and Catch, who is
moving steadily toward the street, crossing a bike path
now. A BIKER is coming on. All in one moment Catch
hears the WHIZZ of the BIKE, Tommy calling out "Thank
you," and Candace shouting "Be careful!" And Catch goes
cold inside and turns quickly and rushes onto the bike
path, taking the collision with the bike so Tommy is sure
to be safe. Catch and the biker fall hard. Sharon stops
-- holding her breath. Tommy watches, wide-eyed, and
Candace comes running.

Catch is rising, a little sore and soiled.        The biker is
angry.

                          BIKER
            Goddammit -- I saw the kid.
            Jesus. I wasn't even close.

But Catch is walking     away with that frozen, numb look,
all shut down by his     fear and his memory as Bob trots
along beside him and     the Biker comes after him and Tommy
and Candace watch him     go and Sharon hurries her steps to
catch up. The Biker      reaches Catch first.

                             BIKER
            Wait a minute!     Hey!

But Catch won't turn to him, walking on -- and the man
gets in front of him, raging.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                          91.

CONTINUED:

                           BIKER
             Why the hell did you cause a
             wreck?! I told you -- I saw the
             kid, you idiot. I was...

Pain and darkness build in Catch's eyes until he says in
a quiet, choked voice, right into the Biker's face...

                           CATCH
             One more word, and your life will
             change forever.

The man stops talking, looking at the dead certainty in
Catch's eyes. He wants to say more, to save face, but
Catch's look holds him like a fist. Sharon has stopped,
frozen, watching. The Biker turns away and walks back to
his downed bike as Catch moves on. Sharon can hardly
believe all of this, following Catch again.


ON CATCH, SHARON

                               SHARON
             Catch!   Catch!

It takes a moment for her voice to penetrate, then he
quickly turns and sees her approaching.

                           SHARON
             Are you all right? Your elbow's
             bleeding. I...

But he is tight, nearly frozen, everything held in.

                               SHARON
             What's wrong?

He walks away from her, and this shakes her, and she
catches up again.

                           SHARON
             Where are you going? Catch --
             you're scaring me. Please...

But he walks on, desperate, and she gets in his way,
faces him.

                           SHARON
             Please, Catch, don't... Can't you
             talk to me?!

He turns and walks off, heading for the street.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                               92.

CONTINUED:

                               SHARON
             Please.   Wait.     I... Catch!

He has walked into traffic -- not completely unmindful of
the cars, but desperate to get away. She watches this,
frozen, as HORNS BLARE. He has to stop in the middle of
the street to wait a moment, and he stands there,
stricken.


ON CATCH

As the traffic moves around him and the dog -- a HORN
BLARES, BRAKES SCREECH, and he thrown into a storm of...


FLASHBACKS

That come sharper and faster than before, bits and pieces
of memory outside any order: He is driving, Annie smiles
at him, headlights blind him, Annie screams, the little
boy in Annie's arms grins at him, BRAKES SCREAM, Annie
says something to him, calmly, but he can't hear her, the
headlights blind him again and BRAKES SCREAM again, and:


BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT)

Catch stands there shaken and shut down.


ON SHARON

Watching him, shocked and frightened for him. She sees
the traffic let up, and Catch crosses and walks toward
home. She watches him go.


EXT. BUSY STREET - DAY (LATER)

As Robby and Sharon's police unit moves along with
traffic. In a moment they pull over and park beside an
office building. It is the same building the man entered
shouting, "Catch!" Sharon watches the building's
entrance. After a while...

                           ROBBY
             Are you going to tell me why we're
             sitting outside this building
             again?

                          SHARON
            Watching for somebody.       Tall guy.
            40s. Grey-blond hair.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                           93.

CONTINUED:

                           ROBBY
             What's it about?

                              SHARON
             It's personal.

                           ROBBY
             Fine -- what am I supposed to do?

                           SHARON
          Chill.

She watches the building, studying the people who come
and go.


INT. CATCH'S APARTMENT - DAY

Catch is at home, still shaken by what happened to him in
the park. He reaches for the PHONE, punches in a number.
It RINGS and Elanora Chu picks up. Catch is deep in his
pain.

                           ELANORA (V.O.)
          Hello?

                           CATCH
                    (softly)
          Hi.

                        ELANORA (V.O.)
          Hi! How are you? Have you been
          out in this great afternoon?
          Brenda took me for a walk.

She senses the silence on the other end and quiets a bit.

                        ELANORA (V.O.)
          Anything wrong?

                        CATCH
          I've been... remembering.

She is quiet for a moment.

                        ELANORA (V.O.)
          Catch... This is good.

                           CATCH
          It's awful.

                           ELANORA (V.O.)
          No.     No, there's good to remember.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                         94.

CONTINUED:

He doesn't speak, shakes his head.

                              ELANORA (V.O.)
             Catch?

                              CATCH
             I'll call you.

He hangs up, staring at his thoughts.


EXT. BUSY STREET - DAY

Sharon is still staking out the office building. Robby
is fidgeting. She just keeps watching. When Robby
begins to speak, she puts up a hand to stop him, going
very still, staring out the window at the man who Catch
was afraid of, Richard Pindella. The man enters the
building. Sharon gets out of the car, intense...

                           SHARON
             Give me fifteen.

And she hurries after the man.


INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

As Sharon enters, sees the man at the elevators. He gets
into an elevator, and she just misses him. She watches
the elevator indicator. It stops at two. She hurries up
the stairs.


INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

As Sharon bangs into a hallway through the stairway door.
She looks one way, looks the other way down the long
hall, and sees the man just entering a door. She walks
to that door. It is marked "private." She knocks and
walks in.


INT. OFFICE - DAY

She enters a comfortable office, many shelves, books,
couch and chairs, big desk. She hears the man's voice
from an anteroom. He's coming toward her.

                           PINDELLA (O.S.)
             Excuse me -- that's a private
             entrance...

He sees her now, sees the uniform.

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                           95.

CONTINUED:

                           PINDELLA
             Oh... is there a problem?

He's calm, gentle in the eyes. She stares a moment,
trying to keep her emotions undercover.

                             SHARON
             I'm not sure.    Who am I speaking
             to?

                           PINDELLA
             I'm Dr. Pindella.

She takes her time, afraid.

                           SHARON
             What kind of doctor?

                             PINDELLA
             What is this?

                           SHARON
             Do you know a Catch Lambert?

                             PINDELLA
             Oh.   Yes!   Is he in trouble?

                           SHARON
             I... need to talk to you.

He glances at his watch, worried for Catch.

                           PINDELLA
             Well, I have a patient in five
             minutes. But I can...

                             SHARON
             Are you a...?

                           PINDELLA
             I'm a psychiatrist.

                           SHARON
             And Mr. Lambert...

                           PINDELLA
             My relationship with Mr. Lambert
             is confidential.

She's dying inside -- but covering, lying, forcing her
way into this.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                          96.

CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             He's your patient. He's your
             patient we... know all this. This
             is police business. I'm officer
             Sharon Pogue -- L.A.P.D.

                           PINDELLA
             Look... I want to help Mr. Lambert
             but I can't tell you anything that
             isn't public record.

                           SHARON
             In general. In general.   He's
             your patient, and he...

                           PINDELLA
             He's not my patient. He walked
             away from treatment. That was...
             nearly a year ago.

                           SHARON
             Why did he walk away?

                           PINDELLA
             I can't discuss that, but if you
             know how to reach him, I would
             appreciate being able to talk to
             him.

                        SHARON
                 (desperate)
          You can help by just   telling me
          what's in the public   record.
          It'll take me half a   day to do a
          search. Can you tell    me? Just...

She is unable to play this out as a "cop," her emotions
coming through. Pindella sees this. She sits on the
edge of a chair and takes a breath, speaks more softly.

                        SHARON
          Can you please tell me what's in
          the record?

He stares a moment, sympathetic -- and realizing...

                        PINDELLA
          You were with him -- in the car.
          Your uniform threw me. Are you
          his friend?

She looks at him, nods.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                               97.

                              SHARON
             More.

He takes that in, leans back on the desk.

                           PINDELLA
             I can tell you he was in an
             accident, hospitalized, referred
             to me as an outpatient...

                              SHARON
             What accident?

                           PINDELLA
             A bus... a city bus hit his
             vehicle. That was a couple of
             years ago. It was... an awful
             thing. His family was in the van.
             His wife and child. His wife's
             parents...

                           SHARON
             A bus... and a van. Where?        On...
             the freeway?

Something is pulling at her memory. Her vision turns
inward, and she stops breathing for a moment --
remembering. She was there. And here we get a...


FLASHBACK - CARNAGE

A glimpse of the carnage -- what she saw, first on the
scene -- with Catch lying there. All the while Pindella
is speaking.

                           PINDELLA (V.O.)
             I think so. Yes. Near Santa
             Monica.  On the freeway. He was
             severely injured but... thrown
             clear.  The others were trapped in
             the van.


BACK TO SHARON (PRESENT)

still in shock, looks at Pindella again.

                            SHARON
             Survivors?   Only him?      I... don't
             remember.

                              PINDELLA
             Remember?

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                          98.

CONTINUED:

                            SHARON
                     (quietly)
             Yes.   I was there. I was there.

Pindella stares, then...

                           PINDELLA
             His wife's mother survived, but...
             she was paralyzed.

She takes a moment, absorbing this.

                            PINDELLA
             Elanora Chu.   She's still in town,
             I believe.

                           SHARON
             Does he... still see her?

                            PINDELLA
             He used to. I don't know.
                    (pause)
             I'm glad to see... he has someone
             else who cares about him. I know
             he's running from this. He left
             all his friends, his home, his
             whole life.

                           SHARON
             He says... he doesn't remember the
             accident.

                           PINDELLA
             He lost a lot of memory. I tried
             to help him with that. He
             resisted. Walked away.

She stares.

                           SHARON
             I think he remembers me.

Very subdued now, she asks...

                           SHARON
             How does he live?

                        PINDELLA
          He received a large settlement
          from the city, but he...barely
          touches it. He was a professional
          musician.

She stares at him and nods.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                          99.

CONTINUED:

                          SHARON
             Trumpet.

As he says that, we hear our TRUMPET MUSIC begin -- a
fast and furious MUTED TRUMPET, incredible RIFFS, and we
use this to carry us, as we...

                                                DISSOLVE TO:


INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Sharon is in the report room, using the computer,
hunting. We MOVE AROUND to see her and the screen. She
is searching the police records to find the accident.
The CONTINUING TRUMPET RIFFS are the motor for this. She
suddenly stops as we FOCUS ON the name: "LAMBERT." Then
we watch her as she punches up the data and she reads.

                                                DISSOLVE TO:


INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

We MOVE THROUGH Sharon's nearly dark apartment, its
stillness in strange contrast to the manic TRUMPET RIFFS.
We PAN to find her curled in a chair, staring deeply,
sadly, drinking a drink. As we PAN, we DISCOVER she is
looking at that mural of the mountains and through this
to her thoughts, and then she makes a decision and rises
and goes to the phone, punches in a number.


INT. CATCH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

He is sitting on his bed, back against the headboard,
sitting there fully dressed, shoes and all, knees up --
as he plays his muted trumpet, hard and fast, playing the
incredible riffs we've been hearing, playing in a driven
way, keeping his demons away. When the RING of the PHONE
breaks through, he stops suddenly. He waits. His
MACHINE CLICKS ON and BEEPS. We INTERCUT the call as
Sharon's voice comes on, subdued.

                           SHARON
             Catch, it's me. Can you pick up?

But he sits there, waiting, listening.

                           SHARON
             Why don't we... meet tomorrow?
             I'll be in Westwood. Can you meet
             me there? Westwood and Cole.
             About two o'clock. Okay?

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                           100.

CONTINUED:

He sits there. He slowly puts the horn down. He reaches
for the phone now -- but she hangs up before he picks up
the call.

                                                 CUT TO:


EXT. WESTWOOD STREET - CORNER - NEXT DAY

Catch waits on a busy street corner in Westwood Village
not far from Santa Monica. He is waiting, glancing over
the passing crowds for Sharon. He sees her. She is off
duty, out of uniform. He watches her until she spots
him. She smiles a little, but there is a mix of fear and
sadness in her smile. They walk to each other and stop
and hug, but it is brief, and then she keeps walking
slowly, and he walks beside her. There is a strain
lingering between them.

                           CATCH
             Shar, I'm sorry about yesterday.
             I...

                            SHARON
             That's okay.

                           CATCH
             It's hard to explain, but it's...
             I'm okay now.

                           SHARON
             You don't have to explain.

He glances at her, wondering, walking along.

                           CATCH
             So... why'd we meet here?

                           SHARON
             So you're the trumpet player who
             was waking people up -- on my
             beat.

They walk along in silence a moment.

                           CATCH
             I used to practice late...
             outside. On my roof.

                           SHARON
             On your roof? That's why we
             couldn't find you.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                          101.

CONTINUED:

                           CATCH
             I didn't know it bothered anybody
             until you mentioned it. You
             arresting me?

They smile nervous smiles. She walks on, leading him
somewhere. He looks about, beginning to show some
agitation, but covering it.

                        CATCH
          You going to tell me where we're
          going?
                 (as she doesn't
                  answer)
          That's okay. I mean... I'll go
          anywhere with you, Shar. Jaws of
          death. The mall on a Saturday.
          Just about any...

He slows his steps, looking across the street and down
half a block...


HIS POV

We see an ivy-covered brick building there, with a sign
that is too far away for us to read.


ON CATCH AND SHARON

He looks quickly away from that building.       She sees his
growing agitation.

                        SHARON
          You can trust me, you know.

She takes his hand.

                        SHARON
          I've got you now. I'm holding on
          -- like before.

                        CATCH
          What d'you mean?

                           SHARON
             Like I held you before.   Like I
             did -- at the accident.

He suddenly pulls his hand out of hers, shocked, and it
shakes her.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                          102.

CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             What makes it so... unspeakable,
             Catch? What makes it like that?

He begins to shut down, to grow cold and numb and not
hear this.

                           SHARON
             Is it because you were driving?

He turns away, closing his eyes.

                           SHARON
             I read the reports, and it wasn't
             your fault. It wasn't. Is it
             because you survived and they
             didn't?

She puts her hand out for him again.

                           SHARON
             Catch. Please. Hold on, and
             we'll go in there together...

He does not take her hand, so she takes his and walks a
few steps toward that building.

                           SHARON
             You can talk to them. You can say
             goodbye or I love you or
             whatever...

He pulls his hand away again, more violently, a layer of
rage over his pain.

                           CATCH
             This is wrong! It's wrong!   Why
             are you doing this?!

                            SHARON
             To help you.

                           CATCH
             I don't need your help! I don't
             need this. We don't need this --
             we're fine...

                           SHARON
             We're not. We're not fine, Catch.
             Nothing is fine -- no matter how
             much you pretend.

It is as if she's fighting for his life again -- and her
own.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                          103.

CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             You pretend that nothing happened.
             You walk all over the city helping
             people, but you're dying inside.

                           CATCH
             I'm not dying! I'm not
             pretending! I don't remember! I
             don't remember any of it. So
             leave me alone! What good does it
             do? It's gone! And I'm all right
             this way! Why do you have to
             change it? I'm all right.

She points at the building across the street.

                           SHARON
             Then walk in there.

He can't even look at the place.

                           SHARON
             Walk in there, and I'll walk in
             with you. Walk in there and say
             it's real -- what happened is
             real. Your family died.

                           CATCH
             Don't talk about that!    Don't!

                       SHARON
                (breaking down)
         All right -- you talk about it!
         You tell me your family died and I
         say yes, I know, I'm sorry, and
         you say, I loved them... and I
         say, what an awful thing to lose a
         family...

                       CATCH
                (unravelling)
         Damn you, Shar. Damn you -- why
         won't you stop?!

                           SHARON
             So you can have a life!

                       CATCH
         I have a life! We could have a
         life. We could get up and go to
         work and come home to each other
         and never, never talk about
         before. We don't need to do that!
         Why do we need to do that?!

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                          104.

CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             Because it happened! Because it's
             the truth! I'm sorry. I'm so
             sorry it happened, but...

                           CATCH
             Nothing happened! If we say it,
             then that's the truth, that can be
             the truth. Say it. Nothing
             happened. Say it, Shar.

                           SHARON
             Catch -- take my hand.    Please.

                             CATCH
             Say it!    I'm asking you to say it.

Her tears come, and she shakes her head.

                             SHARON
             I can't.

                             CATCH
             Why not?

                           SHARON
             Because I want it too much. I
             want everything with you. I want
             all of you -- not just the part
             that isn't hiding and running
             away...

                             CATCH
             Why are   you pushing so hard? Why
             does it   have to be your way? Why
             does it   have to be your truth?
             This is   who I am! This is the way
             I am!

                           SHARON
             Not anymore. It doesn't have to
             be this way anymore because you're
             not alone -- because we're the
             family now. We can be the
             family...

                           CATCH
             You like to push people, don't
             you? You just have to push and
             shove and make it right for you --
             for you. You push everybody,
             Shar. You even pushed your family
             away, didn't you?

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                            105.

CONTINUED:

He has stung her. The tears are in her throat.         She has
to take a moment, but she pushes through to say
quietly...

                           SHARON
             I just... want to say...

                           CATCH
             You already said it.   You said it
             all.

                           SHARON
             When you're ready, I'll be there
             for you. I just want to say that.

And she turns and walks away. He watches her go, angry,
scared and sorry for what he said. He takes a few steps
after her, wanting to call out and to stop her. We see
him almost call to her. He is coming apart, watching
her, needing her so much, but unable to call out.

He is shaky. He takes a glance at that building, then
away. He stares after Sharon -- but she's out of sight
now. He steels himself, then looks across the street
again at that building.

He is desperately afraid. He stares at the building a
long while. He begins to cross the street. He makes
fists to keep from shaking. He walks to the entrance.


EXT. BUILDING - DAY

This is the "Wellston Memorial Chapel and Mausoleum."
The sign is on one of the brick pillars. The iron gate
is open. He can't walk in there. He just can't. He
walks away quickly, as if escaping.


EXT. POLICE BUILDING PARKING LOT - NEXT DAY

The new shift    of cops is heading for its cars -- Sharon
and Robby, Ray    and Sanchez, others. The mood is relaxed,
teasing talk,    but Sharon is way down. She tries to push
her mood away    and tough through it.

                           RAY
             Rib House after shift today?
             4:30?

                           ROBBY
             I think I'll head home.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                        106.

CONTINUED:

                            RAY
             Pogo?   Bring your friend.

                           SHARON
             No, I think I'll turn vegetarian.

                        RAY
          Gotta have that meat to keep your
          strength up.

                        SHARON
          How come it's not working for you?

There is a scattering of laughter -- almost by rote -- as
Sharon enters her car without even the hint of a smile.
Robby notices. She just punches up the CAD monitor, all
business. Our TRUMPET MUSIC comes in, aching now, and
takes us into...


INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

She is exercising on the machine, sliding into her
crunches, fast and furious, but all the pain and sorrow
is in her eyes, and in a moment she just stops. The
TRUMPET MUSIC KEEPS GOING ON through this. She looks
over at the phone.


INT. CATCH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

We PAN OVER Bob-the-Dog, watching something. We see a
few scattered sheets of music lying about, hearing
RUSTLING, and we ARRIVE AT Catch, seated on the floor,
shuffling through a stack of sheet music, driven, looking
for something. The PHONE RINGS. He ignores it. He is
opening up each chart of music, shaking it out,
searching.

Sharon's voice comes on his machine, almost hollow with
sorrow.

                         SHARON (V.O.)
          Catch.  Can you... pick up?
                 (pause)
          Will you call me?

He keeps searching, seeming to not even    listen. The
MACHINE CLICKS OFF. He shakes the next     music chart and
something falls out. He stares at this     piece of paper,
picks it up, slowly turns it over. It     is a picture of
himself, a man blowing a horn, drawn in    crayon by a four
or five-year-old. Catch stares at this     with a depth that
goes on forever, as the MUSIC ENDS.

                                                       107.

EXT. STREET - NEXT DAY

Sharon and Robby are rolling to a stop in a strip mall
parking lot, exiting their car. No rush. She's still
very downbeat. As they walk from the car, he keeps
glancing at her, concerned for her.

                         ROBBY
          Pogo...?

She puts up a hand to brush all the words away. She
can't talk about it. She pushes through it by doing the
work.

                        SHARON
          Which store is it?

                        ROBBY
          The little market there. They
          came through a back window last
          night. Mostly vandalism...

They walk on, but as Sharon reaches the sidewalk, a
little child, three years old or so, toddles out the door
of a shop. A SKATEBOARDER is rattling along, and Sharon
makes a grab for the child, taking his arm gently...

                         SHARON
          Whoa...

... and pulling him to safety as the Skateboarder passes
by shouting...

                         SKATER
          Sorry!

And now the WORRIED MOTHER is emerging from the shop...

                        WORRIED MOTHER
          Oh, God, thank you. Billy!

She picks up her boy, walks back into the shop. Sharon
stands there -- as it all blooms inside of her, rocks
her, really, this little act, evoking Catch, who he is,
what he said and what he means to her. Robby is a few
steps ahead, waiting for her, but she can't move yet,
looking around her now at the people walking among the
shops and cafes. She picks one. She catches the eyes.
She gives a brief smile. The smile is answered, shyly,
kindly, the person moves on.

                         ROBBY
          Pogo?

She doesn't move for a moment.    Then she turns to Robby.

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                          108.

CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             There's something I have to do.    I
             need an address and phone.

                           ROBBY
             What's the name?

                            SHARON
             Elanora Chu.

Robby looks at her, then nods, giving her this.

                            ROBBY
             Let's do it.

They walk back to the car.


EXT. UPSCALE RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY

We see Sharon walking quickly from her police car to the
front of Mrs. Chu's home. Robby waits in the unit.


EXT. CHU HOME - DAY

Sharon walks under that covered portico to the front
door, but before she rings the bell, a voice startles her
a bit.

                            ELANORA (O.S.)
             Pogo?

Mrs. Chu emerges from the shadows of the portico, rolling
her wheelchair toward Sharon. She has a smile for her --
but with some reserve.

                           SHARON
             I'm Sharon Pogue. I know all
             about the...

                            ELANORA
             Elanora.

Sharon nods, very held back.        She gestures toward the
wheelchair self-consciously.

                           SHARON
             I'm sorry for... what happened.     I
             know about the accident.

                           ELANORA
                    (hopeful)
             He told you?!

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                           109.

CONTINUED:

                          SHARON
             No. I found out, and... I
             remembered. I was there.

                              ELANORA
             Oh.   Yes.

Sharon stares a moment, begins with some of her tough
cover in place, over her emotions.

                           SHARON
             I guess he comes here a lot -- to
             talk to you.

                           ELANORA
             He shops for me. Twice a week.

                           SHARON
             Oh. And when he comes here -- he
             never mentions the past, never
             talks about the accident?

                              ELANORA
             No.

                           SHARON
             And you... let him do that?    All
             this time? Why?

                           ELANORA
             It's what he needs.

                           SHARON
             Walking all over the city like...

                              ELANORA
             Like an angel.     Yes. Sweet man.

                           SHARON
             But... you let him get so lost.

Elanora is a bit defensive now.

                           ELANORA
             I let him find his own way through
             it. Why did you come here,
             Sharon?

                           SHARON
             Because... I want to know how to
             help him.

                           ELANORA
             You are helping him.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                         110.

CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             I don't think so.

                              ELANORA
             Why not?

                           SHARON
             He... he was paying me back, I
             guess, for the accident, for
             helping him. That's why he
             felt... so close to me. But...

                           ELANORA
             Is that what you think?

                           SHARON
             But now he probably hates me.
             I...

                              ELANORA
             What happened?

                           SHARON
             I took him to the cemetery, and...

                              ELANORA
             The cemetery!

Elanora's look darkens and she begins to shake her head
in worry.

                           SHARON
             I thought it might help him...
             come back, you know? But he
             wouldn't even go in. He screamed
             at me.

                            ELANORA
                    (upset)
             What made you take him there?

                           SHARON
             For the truth...

                           ELANORA
             He knows the truth.

                           SHARON
             But he won't even say it, or...

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                          111.

CONTINUED:

                           ELANORA
             That's his way. That's his way
             through all this. He made a wall
             -- around that whole day, that
             night -- other things, too. He
             keeps them behind the wall -- his
             little boy, my daughter. He can't
             help it. The cemetery?! Do you
             know how hard it is for me to go
             to the cemetery? Can you imagine?

Sharon is shaken by this, realizing, crumbling a bit as
Mrs. Chu goes on.

                           ELANORA
             That's where it stares you in the
             face -- the loss. And it's too
             much sometimes.

Elanora takes a breath, acknowledging how upset she is.

                           ELANORA
             See? I'm still finding my way
             through it. And Catch -- it
             almost kills him to think about it
             or say it or drive a car or see
             the place where it happened or...
             go by the cemetery.

                           SHARON
             I was trying to help him... come
             back to some kind of life. I...

                           ELANORA
             But he was coming back. Do you
             realize how much he changed in the
             past weeks? His apartment, his
             life, his music is coming back.
             He fell in love! He even got a
             job, Sharon -- for you. For the
             two of you. Isn't that coming
             back? Why do you have to rush?
             Everybody has to rush these days.

Sharon, battered by the truth of this, is totally exposed
now, realizing, admitting.

                           SHARON
             I was scared. I push so hard...
             when I'm scared.

                           ELANORA
             Scared of what?

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                           112.

CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             Losing him. So I did. I lost
             him. He won't talk to me. I... I
             didn't know what I was doing.

Elanora sighs, looking at her, and her anger drains away,
studying Sharon's misery.

                           ELANORA
             You were finding your way.    What
             else can we do? You think    I'm
             always sure what to say to   him,
             what not to say? I do what    I
             think is right and hope he   sees
             the love in it.

She shakes her head at Sharon's tears, her warmth showing
now, liking this girl.

                           ELANORA
             Look at you -- so worried now, so
             miserable. That's the love in it.

                           SHARON
             Did I... make it worse for him?

                           ELANORA
             I don't know. I really don't.
             But I think he'll see the love in
             what you did.

Sharon stares, without much hope. She puts out her hand
to touch Elanora's, to say goodbye. Elanora takes her
hand and holds on a moment, staring into the girl, with
strength. Sharon nods and walks off, dark and sad.
Elanora watches her go.


INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - DAY

It's the next day, and Sharon is preparing to go to her
parents' renewal of vows. She is at the bottom -- with
Catch gone from her life -- but she is doing her best to
go through with this.

We START ON a table, looking at the invitation and next
to that is a wrapped gift. We hear Sharon moving about,
see her nervous, half-dressed, speaking to herself. In
the b.g. we hear our TRUMPET-BASED MUSIC. Very soulful.

                           SHARON
             I just came by to... wish you
             well. To... congratulate you and
             wish you well. Shit.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                        113.

CONTINUED:

She checks the mirror again, doesn't like the look,
starts undressing, comes back to the table with the gift
on it, wonders if she should add more decoration to the
box. She does, and as the trumpet plays on we --

                                           CUT TO:


SHARON

dressed differently, re-wrapping the gift and then --

SHARON

dressed differently, rewrapping it again and then --

                                           CUT TO:


SHARON

sitting still in a chair, holding the gift on her lap,
looking at the clock, nervous, scared, sad.


EXT. STREET - DAY (SAME DAY)

Catch is walking down a commercial street -- no Bob-the-
dog, no strolling gait. He is focused, deep-eyed, on a
mission of some kind. Our MUSIC CONTINUES over this and
on into...


EXT. STREET - DAY

The MUSIC CONTINUES over Sharon driving to the church,
parking, taking a deep breath, exiting the car. There is
no one else outside the church. The ceremony has already
begun. She's planned it that way. She enters the church
as the MUSIC FADES OUT.


INT. CHURCH - DAY

As Sharon comes in quietly. The church is not full, but
perhaps 50 people sit in the front pews, watching the
ceremony at the altar: The priest, Mr. and Mrs. Pogue,
altar boys. Sharon moves forward and slips into a pew a
few back from the altar. The slight disturbance of
people sliding over to let her in causes a few people to
glance over.

                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                          114.

CONTINUED:

One of them is Kathy. They trade a brief, nervous nod.
Then Kathy whispers to her husband...

                           KATHY
             She came.

We see Larry grow tense and angry.

                           KATHY
             Don't say anything.   Think of your
             parents.

Larry doesn't look at Sharon. The little boy, looking
fine in a tiny suit and tie, and being bored, leans to
look at his aunt.

Sharon and Larry, Jr. trade a look.     She winks, then
settles back in her pew, watches.


ON ALTAR

We get our first   look at Sharon's FATHER, Carl Pogue, 62.
Standing beside   his wife, a rather big, stolid guy, taken
with the moment,   both he and his wife emotional over
this. He wears    a hearing aid. The priest is speaking.


ON SHARON

watching with a mix of feelings as the mass continues and
the vows are renewed, the priest reciting the rituals.


EXT. STREET - DAY

The PRIEST'S VOICE from the church plays over this scene,
invoking the blessings, saying the prayers of the mass as
we watch Catch continuing his mission, slowing his steps
now and pausing at the entrance to the Welston Memorial
Chapel. He hesitates. We see the price he's paying and
the determination. He walks through the gate.


EXT. CHAPEL GROUNDS - DAY

He walks into a courtyard of several small buildings in a
garden setting -- all red brick and ivy, fountains and
flowers. He is fighting his way through this, moving
closer to one of the buildings. He is nearly alone on
the chapel grounds, and, as he reaches the sheltered wall
of this building, he is alone.

This is a wall   of bronze vaults within the bricks, and on
each vault is   a plaque -- a name. His breath shivers in
his body as he   struggles to lift his eyes. Slowly, his
gaze comes to   rest on a name: "LAMBERT."

As he stares, the PRIEST'S VOICE from Sharon's church
FADES OUT, and we are left with silence. Catch is
shaky,. He takes a step closer to the wall, to the name,
to them -- and he tries to speak, but can't. He tries
again -- his voice intimate, just above a whisper at
first.

                            CATCH
             Annie. Chet. I don't... want you
             to think I forgot about you. It's
             just that I... I couldn't find
             you.
                    (pause)
             I woke up, and you were gone.
             Everything was gone. It all
             just... disappeared. In one
             minute. I couldn't remember that
             minute. I lost it. It took me so
             long to find it. I think I found
             it all now. I used a calculator.
             I did. I figured it out. You
             know... we get about 1400 minutes
             a day and so I figured it out. I
             was 33 years old and three months
             and eight days, so it was... I've
             got it here...

He fishes a piece of paper out of his pocket. His hand
is shaking as he reads a number off the paper.

                           CATCH
             It was minute number 17 million
             eight hundred ten thousand, two
             hundred... or so.

He puts the paper away.

                           CATCH
             That's the one I lost. And...
             when I lost that minute, I guess I
             tried to lose it all, all the
             memories -- because they hurt. I
             tried, but... I couldn't do it.

We --

                                                         116.

FLASHBACK - INT. VAN

to that minute and, for once, we go in order and     play out
each piece of it. We see Catch driving the van,      his wife
ANNIE beside him. His son Chet is in back with      his
grandparents, Elanora and her husband. The boy      is a bit
whiny, pouty.

We INTERCUT the flashback WITH --


CATCH

at the grave, struggling through this.

                          CATCH
            Chet... you weren't feeling so
            good, remember? It was your
            birthday, and you ate too much.

We see   Annie and Catch both glance back toward Chet, and
we get   present sound in this FLASHBACK scene as Catch and
Annie   both say, "What's the matter? Hm? Aww." And then
Annie   looks out the window and turns to Catch and -- we
CUT TO   Catch at the grave, his eyes filling.

                          CATCH
            And, Annie, you said... you
            said...

In the FLASHBACK we see Annie turn to him again, and this
time we hear her say, softly...

                          ANNIE
            Slow down in the rain, all right?

We GO TO Catch at the grave, fighting tears.

                          CATCH
            And I don't know if I slowed down.
            I don't know. I hope I did,
            but... I didn't always listen. I'm
            sorry. I'm really sorry.

Back in the FLASHBACK, we see Annie reach around as
Elanora hands Chet to her. Then we're BACK at the grave
and INTERCUTTING so that we see Catch speaking through
his tears and we also see this tender moment played out
in the van.

                          CATCH
            ... You put him on your lap, and
            he looked at me, and I made a
            face. Remember? I made you
            smile, Chet.

CONTINUED:

                           CATCH (CONT'D)
             And then we all smiled, and it was
             a great minute. It was. I'm
             really glad... I found that
             minute. No matter what.

Catch stares at the grave, in tears, as the rest of that
minute now plays out, punishing him. It lasts only about
three seconds: a bus out of control, headlights suddenly
glaring through the windshield, Catch turning the wheel,
BRAKES SCREAMING, PEOPLE SCREAMING -- and then it's over.
And Catch has been battered by the memory, and is
weeping, but has not looked away. He is still staring at
the name of his family, and he is able to say, in a
broken voice...

                           CATCH
             I won't forget... anymore.     I love
             you.

He steps forward and puts his hand on the plaque, rests
it there. We STAY ON this, then in a moment, we...

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:


INT. CHURCH - DAY

The renewal of vows is over, and Sharon is standing in
the aisle, nervous and not sure what to do. Guests are
up and milling about, many leaving the church. "See you
at the house." "See you at the party." Etc. A
PHOTOGRAPHER is setting a group shot at the front of the
church. Mr. and Mrs. Pogue, Larry and Kathy and the
little boy...

                          PHOTOGRAPHER
             All right. The whole family in
             this one. Just...

Out of the milling crowd comes Sharon, taking a breath
and braving it, walking up there, speaking quietly.

                           SHARON
             Where do you want me?

The Photographer turns to her, wondering.

                           SHARON
             I'm the daughter.

                            PHOTOGRAPHER
             Oh!   Oh, well, how about...

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                            118.

CONTINUED:

We see the family shift so that Larry and his family are
on one side of the parents. Sharon follows the
Photographer's gesture to stand at the other side, beside
her Mother. Her Father has not looked at her. The photo
is taken. Sharon now turns to her mom and dad. This is
difficult, the strain is thick in the air.

                           SHARON
             You both look so great.

                           MOTHER
                    (nervous)
             You, too.

                           SHARON
             I just wanted to...

The Father speaks to her, his voice not hard, but flat,
not warm either. No smile.

                           FATHER
             You coming to the party?

                             SHARON
             Sure.

He nods, then turns to greet well-wishers. Sharon is
left alone by the drifting away of the family, but one
old couple greets her, the older woman (Mrs. Vander)
wearing her new blue dress, her HUSBAND beaming beside
her.

                             MRS. VANDER
             Sherry!    Look how nice you look.

                           HUSBAND
             Big police officer now.

                           SHARON
             Not so big.
                    (to Mrs. Vander)
             Nice dress.

Sharon moves off toward a side exit, trying to catch up
with Larry and his family.


EXT. SIDE OF CHURCH - DAY

As Larry and his family exit -- and Sharon comes out of
the church, calling ahead.

                             SHARON
             Larry...

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                          119.

CONTINUED:

He starts to just walk on, ignoring her, but Kathy takes
the little boy and walks ahead, with a look at Larry, at
Sharon.


ON SHARON AND LARRY

They nod to a few passing guests. Then they're alone.
His nose is still bandaged, but less so, anger and
betrayal in his eyes.

                           LARRY
             How did you have the guts to walk
             into a church after breaking your
             word?

                           SHARON
             I have to be here. It's a chance
             to make things right, and I'm
             taking it.

                           LARRY
             Why even talk go me? You got what
             you wanted. You laugh about it?
             You tell your cop friends how
             you...

                        SHARON
          You think I talk about it?!    You
          think...

She stops herself, catching her rush toward the old
anger. She goes calmer, deeper, even sad.

                          SHARON
          Here, Lar.

She hands him something. It is the Polaroid photo. He
looks at it, surprised. They lock eyes. She speaks
softly.

                        SHARON
          I was invited. I'm here. I'm
          going to the party. You do what
          you want.

And she walks off toward the parking lot.


INT. POGUE HOME - DAY

We're in the midst of the party. We see Sharon drifting
a bit, a hello here and there. She feels out of place.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                         120.

CONTINUED:

Though the home and yard are thick with people, there is
some tension, especially in the core group -- all who
know about the estrangement of Sharon. Now and then a
nervous glance from her mother is directed at Sharon, or
a hostile glance from Larry.

Sharon passes the videographer, who is pointing light,
camera and microphone at the Vanders -- having them put
their good wishes on tape. She smiles, then looks over
and sees her Father across the room. He is alone. She
steels herself and heads his way. He makes eye contact,
then averts his look. She is approaching him, about to
speak, when he walks up to some friends and starts joking
with them, leaving Sharon hurt, humiliated.

Her mother has seen this and comes to her, speaking
quietly, nervously.

                           MOTHER
             Don't make him talk about...
             anything today.

                           SHARON
             Mom, I was going to fix his tie.
             His tie is crooked.

She sighs, pushing through her hurt to say...

                           SHARON
             It was a nice ceremony.

                           MOTHER
                    (worried)
             Yes. We're running out of
             chicken, though. Nobody's eating
             the ham.

                           SHARON
             It's a great party, Mom.   You look
             happy.

Some joy is allowed to surface in her Mother's face.

                           SHARON
             Thirty-five years and still in
             love, huh?

Her Mother's look clouds a little, nervous again.

                           MOTHER
             You think that's wrong, don't you?

                           SHARON
             Of course not...

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                         121.

CONTINUED:

                           MOTHER
             I always... I feel like
             apologizing to you. But I love
             him.

                          SHARON
             I know.

                           MOTHER
             And then I feel like apologizing
             to him for loving you. I'm the
             one in the middle. I'm the only
             one in this family who knows how
             to forgive anybody.

And she walks away. Sharon's eyes follow her, surprised
and thoughtful. She watches her Mother approach her
Father and straighten his crooked tie. Then Kathy is
moving toward Sharon. Sharon turns to her and they both
speak quietly -- at the same time.

                           BOTH
             You look great.

Then they smile sad smiles.       Kathy gestures to her face,
the faded bruise.

                           KATHY
             Tons of makeup. On Larry, too.

They smile wryly again.

                           SHARON
             Sorry about that, but... I
             couldn't stand him doing that to
             you. I took it on...

                           KATHY
             Don't worry. I'm not your mother.
             If he tries it again, I'm gone.
             I'm out of there, me and Larry
             Junior. He knows that.

They stare, and Sharon gives her a hug, Kathy returns it.


ON LARRY

We see Larry, across the room, notice this hug. He keeps
his expression intact for the group he's in, but we see a
flare of anger in his eyes.

                                                          122.

ON SHARON

moving across the living room.

She sees Larry Jr. sitting alone and goes to him, sits
beside the child -- who looks sad.

                          SHARON
            What's up with you?

                          LARRY JR.
            They won't let me watch T.V.

                         SHARON
            Oh. Well... let's pretend this is
            T.V. It's a show about a party.

They look about the room.

                          SHARON
                   (as if it's a secret)
            That man... is really a super
            hero.

                            LARRY JR.
            Is not.

                          SHARON
            Is too. And so is she. Look.
            See? Red tights under her
            dress... Oh-oh, that man gave her
            a drink with something in it.

                            LARRY JR.
            With what?

                          SHARON
            With stuff to make her sleep.
            He's a bad guy.

The woman sips her drink, and the boy smiles, getting
into it.

                            LARRY
            She drank it.

                         SHARON
            Watch. She'll fall down any
            minute.

The boy is suddenly swooped up, lifted away by his
father. Larry puts the boy down near the door.

                          LARRY
            Hey, sport, you should go play
            outside.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                       123.

CONTINUED:

He turns to Sharon.

                           LARRY
             Stay away from my family.

Then he turns to the crowd, smiling a smile without
humor, speaking loudly.

                           LARRY
             Hey, everybody, keep it down.
             Somebody might call the police.

There is some nervous laughter, people watching them now.
Sharon is angry and embarrassed, keeping her voice low.

                           SHARON
             What're you doing?

                           LARRY
                    (to crowd)
             Once the cops leave, we can really
             party.

The crowd around them is all staring now -- as he turns
back to Sharon.

                           LARRY
             Why don't you give everybody a
             break -- and go home?

In the hushed tension that follows, a GLASS falls and
SHATTERS, and more people quiet down and stare. Sharon
looks at her glaring brother, looks at her Mother
nervously picking up the broken glass -- no support
there. Angry and shaken, she turns to the door.

She walks to the door, opens    it, starts to leave, starts
to close the door behind her,    and she stops, take takes a
breath, battling hard against    the old patterns of hurt
and anger. She looks at that     nearly-closed door. She
pushes it open and walks back    in.

We see a surprised and angry look from Larry, a worried
look from her Mother -- but Sharon is moving through the
crowd, searching until she sees her Father. She heads
toward him. He sees her and walks into the kitchen,
avoiding her. She follows him. We see Larry and his
Mother exchange an anxious look -- and then move toward
the kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Sharon enters, waits, others are leaving the kitchen,
leaving her alone with her dad, but he starts to follow
them.
                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                          124.

CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             Don't walk away. Okay?

He acts as if he just noticed her.

                              FATHER
             What?

She gestures toward his hearing aid.

                              SHARON
             Is it working?     Do you need to
             check it?

He absently touches the device.

                              FATHER
             It's fine.

                              SHARON
             Dad...

But the kitchen door opens. We hear the party going on
out there. Larry and Sharon's Mother enter, her Mother
looking at her husband and back to her daughter, very
frightened. Larry is raging in a near whisper.

                           LARRY
             What the hell are you doing?!

                           MOTHER
             Sharon, please.

                           SHARON
             Please? Please what?! Will you
             stop protecting him? You were
             always protecting him! Don't talk
             to your father. Don't bother your
             father!

She turns to her dad.

                           SHARON
             I'm going to bother you for one
             minute, Dad. Okay? Can you
             handle that?

Larry advances on her.

                           LARRY
             Just get the hell out...

And she turns on him in a fury that halts him.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                          125.

CONTINUED:

                        SHARON
          This isn't about you, Larry -- or
          you, either, Mom. This is between
          me and my father, so leave us
          alone for one goddam minute!

She turns back to her father.

                        SHARON
          How about you, Dad. Do you want
          me to leave?

                           FATHER
             Up to you.

                           SHARON
             Dad... I'm asking. Am I welcome
             here?

                           FATHER
             Jesus -- you're here, aren't you?
             What d'you want?

                           SHARON
             I want to know!
                    (then, quieting)
             Do you want me here? Do you love
             me, Dad? I want to know.

The question's out, and she's totally exposed now -- and
the silence that follows breaks her heart. She nods
toward his hearing aid. Her voice is close to a whisper,
thick with tears.

                           SHARON
             Do you... need to... check that
             again?

                              FATHER
             I feel like...

He can't finish it.

                            SHARON
             What, Dad?   You feel like what?

                           FATHER
             I feel like I don't have a
             daughter anymore.

She takes the blow and doesn't crumble, only her eyes
show the depth of the pain. She speaks quietly, softly.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                           126.

CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             Well... you do. It's a shame
             you're going to miss knowing her.
             You're going to miss all that.

And she leaves, brushing past Larry and her Mother.


INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Sharon comes out of the kitchen, blinking   back tears.
The party goes on around her, oblivious.    She stops on
her way to the door because she sees the   video crew
moving, hunting the next guest -- and she   makes a
decision and walks toward them, stops in   the light, faces
the camera.

                           SHARON
             I'm next.

As they roll tape, people turn, gather, watch.       Sharon
speaks over a torrent of emotions.

                           SHARON
                    (to camera)
             Hi, Mom and Dad. Congratulations.

We see her family coming out of the kitchen and walking
into this, surprised, stopping still.

                           SHARON
             Y'know... being in this house
             reminds me of something.  I was
             about ten, I guess, and Larry and
             I were playing aliens -- remember,
             Lar? We're making a lot  of noise,
             and Dad comes home from work tired
             and pissed off...
                                                 CUT TO:

HER FATHER

watching this. Her Mother is near panic, Larry staring
hard, Kathy wondering. INTERCUT their reactions
during...


SHARON

                           SHARON
             We're yelling like mad, and Dad
             bursts into the room and says,
             what the hell are you doing? And
             I'm scared. I'm really scared.
                           (MORE)
                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                       127.

CONTINUED:

                           SHARON (CONT'D)
             And I say, we're playing alien
             invasion, Dad, and he says, oh,
             yeah, I'll show you a damn
             invasion, and he picks me up,
             picks me up off the floor and
             throws me on the couch. I hit
             that couch and bounce off, and he
             grabs Larry and throws him on the
             couch, and then... then he starts
             making these monster sounds, and
             he says, we came to earth to kick
             ass, and I run at him and jump on
             him and he tosses me on the couch
             and then Larry, and we're laughing
             so hard I almost wet myself, and
             he keeps tossing us and growling
             and beeping, and it was... it was
             great. It was great, and I'm
             never going to forget that.
             Never. And I miss that. I miss
             it. So I just... I wanted to tell
             you tanks for that, Dad. Thanks.
             That's all.
                    (pause)
             Bye.

She hands the microphone back and walks away as the
surprised looks, the deep looks of her Father, Mother,
Larry and Kathy follow her. She walks to the front door
and leaves.


EXT. POGUE HOUSE - DAY

Sharon exits    and starts to walk away. She sees Larry Jr.
look up from    his play. He smiles at her. She returns
the smile --    it means a lot to her, and she walks on. As
she reaches    the gate, she notices something across the
street that    halts her. She stops still, surprised and so
pleased.


HER POV

Catch is there, waiting near her car, watching her now.


BACK TO SCENE - FULL SHOT

as Sharon walks to him, so glad he's there, needing him
-- but still not sure of what he's feeling about her,
until she gets close and sees his eyes and the way he
opens his arms -- and they embrace, and she holds on
tight, eyes closed.
                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                         128.

CONTINUED:

They break the embrace, still holding on, searching each
other's eyes.

                            CATCH
             Sorry, Shar.   For what I said.

                              SHARON
             Me, too.

In a moment, he gestures toward the Pogue house.

                              CATCH
             Was it bad?

                           SHARON
             They don't like me in there.

                           CATCH
             Then they don't deserve you in
             there.

She stares a moment more, still together.

                           SHARON
             That's a nice thing to say.

                           CATCH
             It's not a thing to say.   It's the
             truth.

She can only look away, not wanting to cry.

                           CATCH
             Why do you try so hard not to cry?

She stares at him again. Her throat fills with tears,
mouth is trembling a bit. She starts quietly, finally,
with nothing held back -- but this is not anger as much
as mourning.

                              SHARON
             It's not fair.

The tears come, and she doesn't fight them, emptying the
old, old wound, speaking through her weeping now. The
first time we've seen her cry.

                           SHARON
             It's not fair. Things got better
             for them because of what I did.
             Things got better, and I'd still
             do it. I'd do it all over again.
             And it's not fair they shut me
             out. It's not.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                               129.

CONTINUED:

                            CATCH
             No.
                           SHARON
             It's not fair. I was     19, and I
             didn't know what else    to do. I
             didn't know how else    to stop it.
             It's not fair I don't    have a
             family anymore.

                            CATCH
             No.   It's not, Shar.    It's not.

He raises his hands to her face, places a palm gently on
each cheek, and she covers his hands with her own and
closes her eyes. They remain that way awhile. In a
moment he lightly kisses her forehead. There is a depth
to his words...
                        CATCH
          We're the family, Pogo.

She opens her eyes, staring deep into       his. He has said
it all -- as it is and as it will be.        She smiles a bit
through her tears and nods. He puts        an arm around her
shoulder and holds her tight against       him as they walk to
her car. She puts an arm around his        waist.

They reach the car, and she unlocks it, gets in behind
the wheel as Catch gets into the passenger seat.


INT. CAR - DAY

Sharon just sits behind the wheel, still shaky from
crying. She puts the key in the ignition, but doesn't
move -- no longer sad, but drained now. He watches her.
In a moment, he gets out of the car.


EXT. CAR - FULL SHOT

Catch comes around to Sharon's window. She rolls the
window down, concerned, wondering what he's doing. Is he
leaving? But he reaches for her door and opens it and
says without a fuss...

                           CATCH
          I'll drive.

She stares a long moment,    realizing,    but also making no
fuss about it as she gets    out of the    car, walks around
and enters the passenger    side. They     close the car doors.
Catch STARTS the CAR and    drives them    away. Drives them
home.
                                                   FADE OUT.

                            THE END
