          RICK STEVENS, thirty-six, is Middle America personified. He
          blends in at the crowded ballpark. Blue jeans, work boots, a
          ball cap and leather jacket complete his attire. He snacks on
          a bag of popcorn. The CRACK of the bat and the CROWD is on
          their feet. A BALL PLAYER slides safely into second with a
          double. JOHN SILVERSTEIN, thirty-three, business clad, talks
          on his cell phone. Calm and collected he appears unaffected
          by the cheering crowd. The sits with the crowd.
          
                              RICK
                    Helluva talent, that kid.
          
          John flashes a quick grin, never missing a beat in his phone
          call.

          uninterrupted.

                    Must be something to have that kind
                    of talent. He's just a kid,
                    nineteen, twenty tops, and if he
                    stays healthy and he stays focused,
                    the world is his oyster. Guys like
                    you and me, we squandered those
                    opportunities long ago.

                    just never had the talent.

                    Yeah.
          
                              RICK
                    We're always going in different

                    Mine are much more productive.
          
                              RICK
                    And much less adventurous.

                    Well, I'm gonna...

                    Go?

                    Yeah.

                    That's what I'm going to do.
                    Responsibility calls.
          John turns and heads south. Rick takes a bite of popcorn,
          looks to the sky for a moment, grins, and heads off
          Northeast.

                    Family, my man. Take time off for a
                    ballgame ya should probably tend to
                    the family too. You should try it

                    In the grand scheme of things
                    family is a liability, not an
                    asset. Rick continues on.

          Placing his pistol back in his holster Officer Two grabs Rick
          by the collar and throws him against the cruiser. Officer One

                    Yes.
          
          Officer One appears very eager to discharge his weapon.
          
                              OFFICER ONE
                    Shut him the hell up, Jimmy.

          `Yes' begins to form on Rick's lips. A quick glance at
          Officer One and he decides to nod.
          
                              OFFICER ONE

                    my partner in any way that might be
                    construed as `funny' which could
                    result in harm to your person. Do
                    you understand this right?

                    Nothing pisses me off more than
                    twitching and talking. If he
                    doesn't stop I'm gonna waste him.
          
                              OFFICER TWO

                              DETECTIVE JOHNSON
                    No, that's your job.
          
                              OFFICER ONE
                    If we have to write the report I
                    say I get to shoot him.
          
                              DETECTIVE JOHNSON
                    No one's getting shot today, Bobby.
          
                              OFFICER ONE
                    Can't I just wing him or something?
          
                              DETECTIVE JOHNSON
                    Jimmy; get him out of here.
          
          Officer Two moves to his unwilling partner and helps him
          place his weapon in his holster. Officer One's hand is still
          clenched to his gun as Officer Two drags him around the car
          and forces him into the cruiser.

          FIVE diverse MEN, including Rick, stand against the wall. On
          the other side of the mirror Detective Johnson sits with THE
          LADY IN BLACK (30's). A black veil streams from her hat
          covering her eyes, circa 1930's.
          
                              DETECTIVE JOHNSON
                    Take your time, Ma'am. We need you
                    to be certain.
          
                              LADY IN BLACK
                    Can I see their profiles?
          
          Detective Johnson keys a microphone.
                              DETECTIVE JOHNSON
                    Turn to your left. The men follow
                    their instruction.
          
                              LADY IN BLACK
                    I just... I just don't know...
          
                              DETECTIVE JOHNSON
                    Back to front.
          
          Three men turn to face forward. The other two turn to face
          the wall.
          
                              DETECTIVE JOHNSON
                    All of you face forward. The two
                    turn forward.
          
                              LADY IN BLACK
                    Number three...
          
                              DETECTIVE JOHNSON
                    Are you sure?
                              LADY IN BLACK
                    Could you have him step forward?
          
          The Detective keys his microphone again.
          
                              DETECTIVE JOHNSON
                    Number three take two steps
                    forward.
          
          Rick steps forward and the lights dim on the other four.
          Caught in the spotlight, Rick squints from the brightness.
          The lady in black shifts in her seat. A long beat.
          
                                                                    16.

                              DETECTIVE JOHNSON
                    You're positive?
          
                              LADY IN BLACK
                    I'm positive. That's the man that
                    needs to be in custody.
          
          The detective keys his microphone once again.
          
                              DETECTIVE JOHNSON
                    Okay number three step back. Rick
                    does as he's told.
                              DETECTIVE JOHNSON
                    Turn to your right --- all of
                    you...
          
          The group follows the detective's instruction.
          
                              DETECTIVE JOHNSON
                    ...and exit.
          
          One by one the men filter through the door. Rick EXITS.

          INT. THEATER - CONTINUOUS
          
          Rick ENTERS on stage. The entire theater is cast in shades of
          gray. The stage is barren. There is no audience. He looks
          around for a moment and as he reaches center stage is once
          again flooded with the spotlight. Rick uses his arm to shade
          his eyes. SFX: A SOFT DIN OF VOICES. Looking stage left Rick
          realizes TWELVE JURORS have appeared in their box. A small
          AUDIENCE has congregated. SFX: THE DIN SWELLS TO A QUIET
          CHAOS. A RAPPING of a gavel and Rick's attention swings to a
          white haired JUDGE (70's).
          
                              JUDGE
                    Order in the court.
          
          The noise level wanes, but not completely. Another RAP of the
          gavel.
          
                              JUDGE
                    Order in the court, I say.
          
          Focused on the Judge, Rick doesn't notice THE PROSECUTOR
          approaching from stage right.
          
                                                                   17.

          folders in the other, he sets the chair behind Rick.
          
                              PROSECUTOR

                    Mr. Stevens?

                    Are you being rhetorical?
          
                              RICK
                    Are you asking me?
          
                              JUDGE
                    You stand here today an accused
                    man.
          
                              RICK
                    Accused? Accused of what?
          
                              JUDGE
                    You have been placed in custody of
                    your children.
          
                                 RICK
                    Huh?
          
                              PROSECUTOR
                    Your children, Mr. Stevens. You do
                    realize you have children, don't
                    you?
          
                              RICK
                    Yes, but...
          
                              PROSECUTOR
                    But nothing Mr. Stevens, either you
                    have children or you don't.
          
                                 RICK

                              PROSECUTOR
                    So, you accept responsibility for
                    bringing young life into the world?
          
                                 RICK
                    I guess...

                    PROSECUTOR
          There's no guessing, Mr. Stevens,
          either you're responsible for
          siring offspring or you aren't.
          
                    RICK
          I am, but I'm not sure it was
          responsible.
          
                    PROSECUTOR
          A crime of passion, Mr. Stevens?
          How convenient.
              (A beat)
          And you accept the consequences of
          said actions?
                    RICK
          Why am I here?
          
                    PROSECUTOR
          Why are you here, Mr. Stevens? Why
          are you here? I'll tell you why
          you're here. Are you familiar with
          Ms. Cynthia Stevens?
          
                    RICK
          Yeah, she's my wife.
          
                    PROSECUTOR
          Was your wife, Sir. Was your wife.
          She recently filed for divorce.
          Were you aware of that?
          
                    RICK
          No, no I wasn't.
          
                    PROSECUTOR
          Well, she did. She also named you
          as her coconspirator in the act of
          having children. Were you aware of
          that, Mr. Stevens?
          
                       RICK
          Again, no.
          
                    PROSECUTOR
          Mr. Stevens, you just told the
          court that you aware you had
          children. You have also admitted
          that Ms. Cynthia Stevens was, in
          fact, your wife.
                    (MOR E)

                              PRO SECUT OR (cont'd)
                    On top of that you told this court
                    that you accepted the
                    responsibility of having said
                    children, did you not?
          
                              RICK
                    Yes, but...
          
                              PROSECUTOR
                    Then why, Mr. Stevens, do you
                    continue to deny culpability in
                    this situation?
          
          Rick realizes the audience has swelled to nearly a full
          house. Beads of sweat form on his brow.
          
                              JUDGE
                    Answer the question.
          
                              AUDIENCE
                    Answer the question.
          
          Like a trapped animal, Rick looks for his escape.
          
                              PROSECUTOR
                    The question, Mr. Stevens.
          
                              RICK
                    How can you be sure it was me?
          
          The audience hisses. The Judge RAPS his gavel.
          
                              PROSECUTOR
                    She picked you out of a lineup,
                    Sir. What more do you need?
          
                              RICK
                    Time.
                              PROSECUTOR
                    Time is not an option, Mr. Stevens.
                    Time --- is not --- an option.
          
          A look of sad resignation crosses Rick's face.
          
                              PROSECUTOR
                    You don't deny being married to Ms.
                    Stevens, nor do you deny the act of
                    procreation. You seem to understand
                    that your actions bear consequence.
                    You seem to understand that with
                    parenthood, came responsibility.

                    It seems to me, as it should to
                    anyone with the capacity for simple
                    deduction that you, Mr. Stevens,
                    did willingly and knowingly enter
                    into the commitments of parenthood
                    fully aware of the potential
                    pratfalls. Did you not?
          
                              RICK
                    Yes, yes I did.
          
                              PROSECUTOR
                    It's time to pay the piper, Mr.
                    Stevens.
                        (To the Judge)
                    It is the recommendation of the
                    State that Richard C. Stevens been
                    sentenced to the fullest capacity
                    allowed by law.

                                 PROSECUTOR
                    Excuse me?
          
                              RICK
                    My ex, Cindy, what about her
                    responsibilities to the children?
          
          The Prosecutor moves to Rick and whispers in his ear.
          
                              PROSECUTOR
                    She cut a deal, Rick. You were the
                    one we wanted. You were the one we
                    got. She took the plea. Sure, it
                    costs her financially. But what is
                    freedom worth?

                              JUDGE
                    I see no reason to extend this any
                    further. Mr. Stevens you have been
                    found competent by the State and by
                    this Court. You are completely
                    cognizant of your surroundings, and
                    you leave me no choice. This court
                    finds you guilty as charged.

                    You are hereby remanded to custody
                    of your children for no less than a
                    lifetime. This Court is adjourned.
          
          A GASP in the audience mixed with CHEERS. Rick appears
          dumbfounded. A BAILIFF approaches Rick and begins to lead him
          off stage. Rick scuffles and struggles. The Judge stands and
          begins to collect his files.

          Mommy mad at me too?

          No, baby, not at all. Your mom
          needs time to work through some
          things. So, for awhile, it's just
          going to be us...

                    isn't permanent... we're going to
                    fight this... we're going to
                    appeal. We'll take it to the
                    Supreme Court if we have to.
                              KRIS
                    You don't want us either?
          
                              RICK
                    Of course I want you. I just don't
                    think I should have to do this
                    alone.

                    I've seen your kind before. You're
                    a lifer. Whether it's fair or not.
                    Whether justice was served. It
                    doesn't matter. You're here for the

                    Because it doesn't have to be like
                    this. Mary Ryan, a friend of mine,
                    her son had the same thing happen
                    to him. Wife just up and left with
                    no warning at all. He didn't waste
                    a day. No sir, he was up and at `em
                    almost instantly. You can leave
                    here, you know? Mary Ryan's son
                    did.

                    What's to like? It's dingy and
                    filthy. It's no place to raise
                    children.

                    It's been five days, mom. I'm not
                    hiding. I just need time to adjust.

                    No, but I think you should. I hate
                    that woman. How can a mother
                    abandon her kids? How could she do
                    this to my babies?

                    So, needless to say, I understand
                    your situation. My old lady, she
                    took off and left me with the kids
                    five years ago. That bitch. But I'm
                    not bitter or anything. I found me
                    a good day care and moved on with
                    my life. You should too.

                    Of course it's hard, sometimes
                    feels like you're in prison, but
                    you gotta be a man... stand up for
                    yourself... provide for your
                    family.

                    Me? I'll put ya to work. Some long
                    hours, but it all pays off. Keeps
                    you off the welfare system if ya
                    know what I mean.

                    Well, I need to give him a local so
                    that I can sew the laceration, but
                    he's not cooperating. Maybe hold
                    his hand and distract him?
          Rick moves to Phillip.

                    nothing works. I was wondering if
                    our kids could play together. Maybe
                    some of Phillip's "boy" would rub
                    off on Junior.

                    Hi.
          
                              MELANIE
                    I'm Melanie... The baby-sitter...
          
                              RICK
                    Oh, right, I'm glad you could...
          
                              NICHOLAS
                    My daddy has a big pee-pee.
          
                              RICK
                    I was just demonstrating the art
                    of...
          
                              MELANIE
                    It's okay. I saw.

                        (Mumbling)
                    Great.
          
          Melanie ENTERS the cell followed by Zach.
          
                              RICK
                    You have a kid.
          
                                 MELANIE
                    So do you.
          
                              RICK
                    Not criticizing, just surprised. I
                    don't believe anyone at their old
                    day-care had kids. If they did they
                    kept them in a closet and only
                    brought them out on special
                    occasions. Christmas, Easter, an
                    occasional birthday, and maybe when
                    they had friends over for dinner,
                    but only as a status symbol. It was
                    like they'd say, "Here's the white
                    picket fence. Here's the SUV.
                    Here's the dog. Oh yes, here's the
                    2.5 children. Kids you can get back
                    in the closet now."
          
                                                                 46.
          
          
          
                              MELANIE
                    You'd could make a fortune with a
                    Renta- Kid business.
          
                              RICK
                    That has potential.
          
                              MELANIE
                    I've often thought of renting mine.
                    Why pay for a baby-sitter when
                    thousands of people would pay good
                    money to set your kid on the mantle
                    for a few hours?
          
                              RICK
                    So, what's his name?
                                ZACH
                    I'm Zach.
          
          Rick drops to a knee and extends his hand.
          
                              RICK
                    Hello Zach. I'm Rick.
          
                              ZACH
                    You're old.
          
                              RICK
                    You got me there. I am old.
          
                                ZACH
                    How old?
          
                              RICK
                    Older than dirt. When I was a kid
                    we didn't have dirt. We had rocks
                    and we had hammers. If we wanted
                    dirt we banged a few rocks with
                    really big hammers, and then we had
                    dirt.

                    Beautiful kids.
                              RICK
                    Thanks. So's your's.

                    Ever try Cheerios?

                    For potty training. Give him
                    something to aim at. Drop a Cheerio
                    or two in the toilet and let him
                    pee away.
          
                              RICK
                    I'll have to try that. So, any
                    questions about the job? Melanie
                    moves towards the boys.
          
                              MELANIE
                    I'm going to go talk to them for a
                    little bit. I'll let you know.
          
          Melanie crouches to the boy's level. They appear to take a
          real shine to her. Nicholas hands her a book, and the four of
          them move to the cell cot. The boys gather round.

          lit room. Rick watches from a doorway.

                    Not a knack really. It's just about
                    finding hope in places there should
                    be none.

                    You're a terrific man. Did I tell
                    you I love kids? They love me. It
                    just comes so instinctively even
                    though I've never had kids myself.
                    I get lots of practice with my
                    nephews though. So, when can I meet
                    your boys?

                    I did not. I left them in the care
                    of their loving father. There's a
                    difference.

                    I ain't some charity case. I know
                    what you think when you look at me.
                    You think; Look at that poor, poor
                    woman. Look at those poor, poor
                    children. How unfortunate it must
                    be that they only have a mother.
                    How terrible it must be not to know
                    their father.

                       Four. Two on top and two on bottom.
                       He got a quarter for the first one,
                       fifty cents for the next two and he
                       parlayed the last into an even
                       dollar. Nicholas cries at night
                       because he thinks the house is
                       filled with ghosts. Kiss him once
                       on the forehead, once on the cheek
                       and sing The Cradle Will Rock and
                       he'll sleep the whole night
                       through. Kris' favorite subject is
                       math. He loves to read and write,
                       but he doesn't do so well in social
                       studies. He knows how to ride a
                       bike. Why? Because I taught him.
                       Phillip wants to learn but he's
                       always afraid he'll fall. Nicky
                       just likes to Flintstone his
                       tricycle. Phillip's favorite
                       cartoon is Tunenami.

                    being pregnant, but I sucked as a

          and then tugs at his father's shirt. Rick tries to ignore the
          child but then stops mid-dance.

          Kris points up.

          Too late, Kris has tripped over a can of paint. As he sits on

                    Long way up.

                    that you would burden this court
                    with convening today?

                    alone? A hushed MURMUR rises in the

                    Order in this court! A beat as

                              JUDGE (CONT'D)
                    Your inquiry, Mr. Stevens? Is it in
                    the best interest of the children
                    or in the best interest of you?

                    Then this court sees no reason to

                    I have. I have laid my heart out on
                    the line time and time again, only
                    to walk away empty handed. This
                    love, this caring, this sharing of
                    life, it's a sentence and my heart
                    has been condemned. It doesn't
                    matter who I've told, what's in my
                    heart is never quite enough. The
                    people I have cared for most have
                    shunned me in life and in love.
                    Unanswered phone calls... Unnoticed
                    displays of affection... A rose
                    that withers on the doorstep... No
                    matter what I do, it's never
                    enough. Just once, just one fucking
                    time, I want to be enough.
          
                              PROSECUTOR
                    Your only condemnation is self-
                    pity. You have people that care all
                    around you, but you're too blind to
                    see them. If you don't pull
                    yourself together soon, my friend,
                    they soon will all be gone.

          blows the leaves of a tree. The boys run further and further
          out until they are out of sight. Rick calls out to them.
          Slowly, across the field, three young adults return. Rick is
          now an old man, hunched over and aged with wrinkles. The
          three young men walk beside their elderly father, supporting
          him with each step.

          "instruments" to add a serenade. The music is a mishmash of
          odd notes that could only be construed as music to a parent's
          ear. Melanie stands on the front porch, her arms crossed.

                    Yes you did.

                    Life's not fair Rick.
          
                              RICK
                    You were more a mother to my boys
                    than they have ever known. You were
                    more a woman to me than I have ever
                    deserved.
          
                              MELANIE
                    You're right.
          
                              RICK
                    You're not going to make this easy,
                    are you?
                              MELANIE
                    Cut the bullshit, Rick.
          
          Rick wraps his arms around Melanie and pulls her in for a
          hug.
          
                              RICK
                        (In Mel's ear)
                    I can live my life alone. I can
                    raise my kids alone. I can walk
                    this path alone. I'd much rather do
                    it with you.
          
                                                                 89.
          
          
          
          Grabbing him by the collar she's torn. Melanie shakes her
          head.
          
                                 MELANIE
                    I can't.
          
          She turns to go inside.
          
                                 RICK
                    Can't?
          
                              MELANIE
                        (Turning back around.)
                    I won't.
          
                              RICK
                    I shouldn't have come here.
          
                              MELANIE
                    No, you shouldn't have.
          
          Rick turns to leave.
          
                              MELANIE
                    You just don't get it do you?
          
                                 RICK
                    Get what?
          
                              MELANIE
                    You're here for you, you selfish
                    prick.

          Melanie lays in bed covering her ears.
                              MELANIE (VO)
                    Days go by when I lose me. There
                    are nights when I lay in bed and I
                    can hear Zach through the walls.
                    He's crying out for me, and I lay
                    there motionless, wishing I was
                    anyone but me, anywhere but here,
                    thinking that somewhere, sometime,
                    there has to be room for me. But
                    that someday never seems to come.
                    You're dangerous. Loving you means
                    I lose me. And I will never lose
                    let that happen.

                    So, don't come knocking on my door,
                    asking for my heart, if you don't
                    have room for me.
          
          Melanie ENTERS the house closing the door behind her. Rick
          tosses the flowers on the porch, turns and walks away. The
          boys follow behind.
          
                              KRIS
                    I could have looked sad.
          
                              PHILLIP
                    I can look sad too.
          
                              KRIS
                    But I look sadder.
                              NICHOLAS
                    I sad.
          
          Nicholas starts to cry.

                              PHILLIP
                    Don't quit, daddy.
          
          Rick pounds the ground, pulls himself up, dusts himself off
          and with a determined look starts back up the hill.
          
                              KRIS
                    Daddy doesn't quit.

                    You love her?
          
                              RICK
                    I think so... I don't know.
          
                              JOHN
                    If you think you're in love you
                    are.

          I suppose I am.
          
                    JOHN
          Does your heart skip a beat when
          she walks by?
          
                    RICK
          She's my best friend... or was.
          
                    JOHN
          Does your heart skip a beat when
          she walks by?
          
                       RICK
          Yes.
                     JOHN
          Do your palms sweat when you think
          about her?
          
                       RICK
          Yes.
          
                    JOHN
          Does she inspire you?
          
                    RICK
          With music and poetry.
          
                    JOHN
          And is there passion?
          
                    RICK
          There's fire.
          
                    JOHN
          And have you ever told her this?
                       RICK
          She knows.
          
                    JOHN
          Have you ever told her this?
          
                       RICK
          No.
          
                    JOHN
          Don't you think you should?
          
                    RICK
          It only confuses things.
          
                                                                   92.
          
          
          
                              JOHN
                    Loving your best friend confuses
                    things? I can't think of a love
                    more lucid. Rick stands to leave.
          
                              JOHN
                    You know I'll never forgive you for
                    this, don't you? You had the power
                    and the dream at your fingertips
                    and you're giving it all away.
          
                              RICK
                    You didn't marry your best friend?
          
                                JOHN
                    No.
                              RICK
                    I thought you had things all
                    planned out.
          
                              JOHN
                    Affairs of the heart and those of
                    the mind are two different things.
          
                              RICK
                    It's not too late, you know?
          
          With a shrug John drops to one knee in front of Rick.
          
                              RICK
                    Go Home, John. Go home and talk to
                    your best friend the way you talk
                    to me.

                    I'd just like some coffee.
          
          Melanie walks off. Rick grabs a cup from a recently vacated
          table and sets it in front of the patron.

                        (Setting the cup back
                         down.)
                    Quit your bitching.
          
          Rick moves to Melanie.
          
                                                                 95.
          
          
          
                              MELANIE
                    I can't believe you came here.
          
                              RICK
                    I can't believe you're a waitress.
          
                              MELANIE
                    Beats chasing around after snot
                    nosed brats all day.
          
                              RICK
                    I thought you liked my kids.
          
                              MELANIE
                    I was talking about you.
          Melanie moves on. Rick gives chase. He catches her and spins
          her around spilling coffee all over the floor.
          
                              RICK
                    I deserved that.
          
                              MELANIE
                    So, what do the kids need? A
                    babysitter? A surrogate mom?
          
                              RICK
                    This isn't about the kids.
          
                              MELANIE
                    Then what's it about?
          
                              RICK
                    It's about me, the selfish prick.
          
                                 MELANIE
                    About you?
                              RICK
                    Hear me out, okay?
          
                              MELANIE
                        (Looking at her watch.)
                    You have 15 seconds.
          
                              RICK
                    Okay, okay.
          
                                 MELANIE
                    Ten.
          
                                                          96.
          
          
          
                              RICK
                    Melanie, there is a grace about you
                    that reminds me how clumsy I am.
                    There is an honesty about you that
                    reminds me how deceitful I can be.
                    There is a beauty in your eyes that
                    reminds me how ugly I've become.
                    There is a kindness in your voice
                    that contradicts my coarseness.
                    There is a glow around you that
                    illuminates my dullness. There is
                    spirit in you that challenges my
                    laziness, but most of all, there is
                    a woman in you, that sparks my
                    desire, a desire to be graceful and
                    honest and beautiful and kind. A
                    desire to be better than I am or
                    ever thought I could be.
          
                              MELANIE
                    Go on.
          
                              RICK
                    I think my ten seconds are up.
          
                              MELANIE
                    Who's counting?
          
                              CUSTOMER 2
                    Miss... My coffee?
          
          Melanie sets the coffee on a nearby table.
          
                              MELANIE
                    Get it yourself.
          
                              RICK
                    I love you.
                              MELANIE
                    I don't think I heard you.
          
                              RICK
                    If I give you my heart will you
                    promise to treat it softly? Kiss it
                    when it hurts? Put it in a box and
                    know that it belongs to you?
          
                              MELANIE
                    That's not what you said.
          
                              RICK
                    I said I love you.
          
                                                                 97.

                    As brutal as that can be?
          
                              RICK
                    I love you. I love you, I love you,
                    I love you.
          
                              MELANIE
                    I kind of like you too.

          EXT. GORGE PARK - DAY
          
          Rick comes to another plateau and finds Melanie waiting for
          him.
                              MELANIE
                    I never thought you'd make it.
          
                              RICK
                    Been waiting long?
          
                              MELANIE
                    I never thought you'd find me.
          
                              RICK
                    I had to find me first. I hope you
                    plan on walking, cause I'm not sure
                    I can carry you.
          
                              MELANIE
                    So, how do we do this? The two
                    begin the ascent together.
          
                              RICK
                    One step at a time?
                              MELANIE
                    Side by side?
          
                              RICK
                    Maybe you could carry me?
          
          Rick jumps in Melanie's arms. They tumble to the ground under
          his weight.

          Rick packs his things in boxes. A knock at the door and the
          room morphs back into the cell.
          
                                                                 98.

          Rick turns around to see the jailer standing at the door.
          
                              JAILER
                    Getting out of here, huh?
          
                              RICK
                    It's time to move on.
          
                              JAILER
                    If you leave don't ever come back.

                    Not even...
                              JAILER
                    Not even on a visit. You're a very
                    ugly man. I'd hate to explain to
                    the other guards why you'd come to
                    visit me.

                    So, this is where it all happened.
          
                              RICK
                    It's funny, the tricks the mind can
                    play on you... but the Judge, he
                    sat right over there... and the
                    jury sat right there... and the
                    audience was filled with all these
                    people who didn't really give a
                    shit about me.
          
                              MELANIE
                    A bunch of innocent bystanders?
          
                              RICK
                    And they all sat passing judgement
                    on me, not knowing the situation,
                    just staring over their schoolmarm
                    spectacles and pointing their
                    crooked fingers.

                    Always casting dispersions.
          
          Rick walks off leaving Melanie at center stage. She looks
          around. The faint echo of a Judge's gavel can be heard in the
          distance.
