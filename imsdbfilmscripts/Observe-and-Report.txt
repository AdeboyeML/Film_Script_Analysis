          EXT. CAROLINA MALL - MORNING
          
          ONE LONG TRACKING SHOT FROM THE BACK.
          
          A PERVERT in a trench coat runs along the edge of the
          mall. A group of OLD WOMEN is coming toward the MAIN
          ENTRANCE. The Pervert opens his trench coat and flashes
          the old women. They SCREAM!
          
          The Pervert ducks behind the bushes and runs with the
          skill of a Navy SEAL. A FAMILY is walking down the
          sidewalk. The Pervert opens his trench coat and flashes
          them.
          
          The Pervert ducks behind a dumpster. He keeps running
          and sees a car driving by. The Pervert flashes the CAR.
          
          The Pervert takes a two-step run, sees ANOTHER LADY,
          flashes her. He dives behind a car. Then pops up and
          flashes ANOTHER GIRL.
          
          It's an all-out Pervert assault!
          
          The Pervert then runs across the parking lot, jumps a
          fence, and darts from the property -- vanishing as
          quickly as a Ninja who just perfectly executed an
          assassination.
          
          
          INT. MALL - BUSINESS OFFICES - DAY
          
          MARK, the Mall Manager, walks by a group of women, who     
          were exposed to the Pervert. They crowd around and         
          complain loudly.

                     important to us than the safety of              
                     our shoppers. Now in the

                     minute.
          
          Mark walks down the hallway that houses all of the         
          business affair offices. He stops at the RECEPTIONIST'S    
          desk.

          The Mall Manager quickly walks off.    On the way, he          
          passes a JANITOR.

          The Mall Manager keeps walking.
          
          
          INT. SECURITY OFFICE - DAY
          
          The Mall Manager comes into the surveillance room. It's
          a small office with monitors that show the different
          security cameras around the mall. DENNIS, a Mall
          Security guard with sunglasses who will not utter a word
          ever, turns around in the chair.

          Dennis shrugs.

          INT. GARAGE - DAY
          
          Blackness. White shafts of light sporadically shoot
          through the dark and we see IMAGES. A GIANT FLASHLIGHT
          is inserted into a UTILITY BELT. MACE is inserted in the
          other side. A WALKIE-TALKIE is turned on. A TASER is
          sparked. MIRRORED SUNGLASSES are pushed over the nose.
          
          A garage door raises and bright light spills in...
          
          
          EXT. GARAGE - DAY
          
          A garage door opens slowly and reveals a souped-up ORANGE
          GOLF CART. There's a siren on top that spins around.
          The man driving is RONNIE BARNHARDT (28), a stocky mall
          security guard whose expression reads all business.
          Ronnie pulls out of the garage...

          EXT. MALL - DAY
          
          HEAVY METAL MUSIC. A group of anarchist SKATERS rages
          through the mall parking lot tearing up everything they
          see. A couple of them smoke cigarettes. One skater
          grinds over a bench. One kid ollies onto the hood of a
          car. Another slams into an old man and knocks him over.
          
          Meanwhile, Ronnie sits in his golf cart -- waiting. He
          looks eerily like Mel Gibson at the beginning of Mad Max.
          
          The skaters ride past a set of construction cones. One
          skater picks up the cone and tosses it across the parking
          lot.
          
          The skaters soar past Ronnie, who flips on the silent
          orange siren and gives chase.
          
          As the skaters ride through the parking lot, Ronnie pulls
          up and drives alongside of them.
          
                                  RONNIE
                            (cop authority voice)
                    Pull over to the sidewalk, NOW!
          
          STEVIE, the leader of the skaters, yells back.
          
                                  STEVIE
                    Fuck off, Ronnie, it's just a                      
                    parking lot.                                       
          
                                  RONNIE
                    Sir, pull over to the sidewalk,
                    NOW!
          
          HECTOR, another skater, joins in.
          
                                  HECTOR
                    Leave us alone.                                    
          
                                  STEVIE
                    Yeah, skating's not a crime, dick.
          
                                  RONNIE
                    Skateboarding is not allowed on
                    mall premises. Pull over now!
          
                                  STEVIE
                    We're not leaving.
          
                                  HECTOR
                    Yeah, fuck you!
          
          The skateboarders flip Ronnie off and push hard to get       
          away from him. Ronnie guns it and an all out chase
          ensues.
          
                                                      (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          Ronnie pulls up alongside of a SLOW SKATER. Ronnie side-
          swipes the skater, forcing the skater to run into a trash
          can and fall.
          
          Ronnie catches up to ANOTHER SKATER. This time, Ronnie
          tries to hit the skater on the side again, but he is too
          fast. Ronnie swerves trying to get him, but he dodges
          and ducks. Ronnie hits the brake. The skater thinks he
          has escaped, but looks up and sees that a car is in his
          way. The skater nails the car and is thrown over the
          hood.
          
          Ronnie is back in the chase and only Hector and Stevie
          are left. Ronnie guns the golf cart and zooms up closely
          behind the two kids.
          
          Ronnie rams Hector over and over from behind. Hector
          wobbles. Ronnie rams him again. Hector goes swerving
          off and falls down hard.
          
          Ronnie doesn't break his pace and guns it toward Stevie.
          
          Stevie is good. He turns and rides through cars, ollies
          over parking blocks, and through pedestrians. Ronnie
          burns down the lane beside him.
          
          Stevie looks behind and Ronnie is nowhere in sight.    He's
          in the clear.
          
          Stevie turns back around and sees Ronnie, driving in
          reverse straight towards him. Ronnie rams into the
          skater and knocks the poor kid on his ass.                     
          
                                     STEVIE                              
                       What the fuck are you doing?

                       I was driving in reverse and                      
                       trying to get you to flip into the                
                       back seat.                                        
          
                                     STEVIE                              
                       What?                                             
          
                                     RONNIE
                       That way I could handcuff you                     
                       smoothly and take you in. You                     
                       know, never mind, just get in the                 
                       goddamn golf cart.                                
          
          Stevie picks himself up slowly and hobbles toward the          
          golf cart.

          INT. MALL - SECURITY OFFICE - MORNING
          
          Ronnie is in the room with the monitors. The skaters sit
          across from him. There's a poster on the wall with the
          security guard motto: OBSERVE AND REPORT.
          
          Ronnie fiddles with his walkie-talkie.                      
          
                                  RONNIE
                    It seems like we go through this                  
                    every day. What's it going to                     
                    take for you all to realize that I                
                    won't tolerate this horseplay and                 
                    just do whatever you want to and                  
                    don't worry about the rules                       
                    attitude?                                         
          
                                  STEVIE
                    Ronnie, I hear what you're saying                 
                    and I just want you to know that                  
                    personally, it pains me to see you                
                    all worked up and I just want you                 
                    to know that I'm really sorry                     
                    because you can't do shit and you                 
                    can take your little rules and

          The Skaters all start cracking up.                          
          
                                  HECTOR

          The Skaters start laughing louder.                          
          
                                  RONNIE
                    That's funny, guys. I try to be a                 
                    mentor to the youth, but it seems                 
                    like you boys have gone straight                  
                    past boydom to the land of street-                
                    hardened criminals. I'm left with                 
                    no choice. You call me rent-a-                    
                    cop, but I call myself the law's                  
                    right hand. I see the crime...

                       minute to talk. There's no easy                 
                       way to say this so I'm just going               
                       to come right out with it. Mark                 
                       offered me the position of Head of              
                       Mall Security. I know this isn't                
                       easy for you to hear seeing as                  
                       you've been here longer than me.                
                       But I want you to know that you're              
                       my best friend and I'm only going               
                       to accept the job if you're okay                
                       with that.                                      
          
          Dennis shrugs.

                       accepted and it's too late to turn              
                       it down now. Every ship needs a                 
                       captain. So you were passed over.               
                       Who gives a shit? Dennis, in                    
                       time, you'll come to accept                     
                       answering to me. Remember, there                
                       aren't any leaders in friendship.

          Dennis and Ronnie shake hands.    They walk out and lock     
          the doors behind them.

          Dennis doesn't say anything and just walks to his car.
          Ronnie follows.
          
                                     RONNIE
                       Yeah, you're right. You're
                       probably in no mood to party after
                       that news. Well, try not to take
                       it too hard. See you later,

          Ronnie leaves Dennis and walks to his car.
          
          
          EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT
          
          Ronnie's home is a shitty double-wide at the very end of
          the shittiest trailer park in town.
          
                                                                 17.
          
          INT. RONNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Ronnie lives in a boy's room. There's all kind of
          posters up with instructions on how to execute choke
          holds, wrist locks, and other assorted death blows.
          However, the biggest decoration is a large diagram of the
          mall.
          
          Ronnie stands in the middle of his room with his MOM
          across from him. She's an old, thick boozer, with the
          strength of a father and the love of a mother. She downs
          a full beer and throws it against the wall.
          
                                  MOM
                    You think you're ready for a shot
                    at the title, motherfucker?!
          
                                  RONNIE
                    I'm ready, Mom.
          
                                  MOM
                    Ding ding.
          
          Ronnie and his Mom take to fighting. Ronnie's Mom is
          surprisingly good and she lands the first blows to
          Ronnie's cranium.
          
                                  RONNIE

                    Fuck you!
          
          Ronnie attacks his Mom. He manages to scoop her and body
          slam her to the ground. Ronnie's Mom flips out of it on
          the ground. However, Ronnie holds onto her wrist and          
          stands up, thus locking in the submission hold.
          
                                  MOM
                    Ah!

          Ronnie flips the wrist lock tighter!
          
                                  MOM

          Ronnie lets his Mom go.     She shakes off the pain.
          
                                     MOM

          Ronnie's Mom rubs her arm. Ronnie drops his guard and
          comes over to tend to his Mom's wounds. However, she's
          only playing possum. Ronnie's Mom sees an opening and
          attacks Ronnie at his legs. Ronnie goes down and the two         
          start wrestling again.

                       Kind of funny they thought they
                       needed more security here. Ha.
                       You do realize that if anyone gets
                       out of hand, you need to call me
                       to handle the situation.

          LOUD ROCK SCORE FADES TO LOUD ROCK SOURCE. A tricked-out
          Toyota pulls up to the parking lot. The car comes to a
          stop and out steps Brandi, the makeup counter girl.            
          
          Brandi walks toward the mall to start her new day. As          
          she crosses the parking lot and heads toward the door,
          the Pervert pops out. This time, he's upped his attack
          and beats off staring right at her.
          
          The horrendous sight stops Brandi dead in her tracks.

          It looks like a RAPE SCENE. Brandi cries in the makeup         
          chair and is surrounded by a large group of mall
          employees. Her makeup runs down her face as her
          effeminate coworker BRUCE consoles her. Mark is working        
          crowd control.

                       My name is Ronnie Barnhardt, chief
                       inspector on the case and head of
                       Mall Security here at Carolina
                       Mall and this is my lieutenant,
                       Dennis. From one law enforcement                    
                       officer to another, I just want to                  
                       welcome you and say that we will                    
                       do whatever it takes to coordinate                  
                       with your department in order to                    
                       bring this assailant to justice.                    
          
          The Detective pauses as if he's unsure what just
          happened.

                                (back to Brandi)                           
                       Okay, Brandi. Did you get a look                    
                       at the suspect?

                       Thank you. Brandi, can you                          
                       remember anything specifically?
                       What color was his hair? Was he
                       tall or short?
          
                                     BRANDI                                
                       He was tall and skinny and he had
                       brown hair and it was real greasy.
          
          Detective Harrison begins writing in his note pad as
          Brandi speaks. Ronnie notices this and picks up some             
          paper and begins to write as well.
          
                                     DETECTIVE HARRISON

                       It was long about to his
                       shoulders.

                       No, he just stood there and you
                       know, touched himself.
          
                                     DETECTIVE HARRISON

                       Just a brown trench coat.

                       This is what I got so far.
          
          Ronnie holds up his paper. Ronnie has drawn a crude
          sketch of the Pervert that Brandi described, but it's           
          basically a long-haired stick figure with a penis.
          
                                     RONNIE
                       What's yours look like?
          
                                     DETECTIVE HARRISON
                       I just wrote a description.
          
                                     RONNIE
                       Oh.
          
          Ronnie puts his sketch away.
          
                                     DETECTIVE HARRISON
                       Okay, Brandi, I think that's good                  
                       for now. I think the best thing
                       at this point is to just follow up
                       with the other ladies who saw the
                       perpetrator yesterday and see if
                       they remember anything.
          
                                     BRANDI                               
                       What if he comes back?                             
                                                                          
                                     DETECTIVE HARRISON
                       That's highly unlikely. These                      
                       incidents are usually random and                   
                       unpredictable. I'm sure you'll be                  
                       safe.

                       pretty clear that Brandi's been                     
                       targeted.

                       Well, how about the fact that she
                       was the first employee to get                       
                       assaulted? Not to mention the
                       fact that she is the prettiest
                       girl who works at this mall. To
                       me it seems obvious that this is
                       some sort of methodical villain
                       that plans on returning to finish
                       what he started by murdering
                       Brandi.

                       That's not going to happen.
          
          Ronnie looks at Brandi and nods his head "yes."

          The living room is dark. Ronnie and Nell are on the              
          couch making out. Ronnie is starting to get frisky. His          
          hands go to Nell's boobs, but only outside of the shirt.         
          She allows it.

                       I've already checked the Security                    
                       tapes. They didn't catch a thing.                    
                       Someone must have broken in here                     
                       and turned them off.

                       My team just checked all the doors
                       and there are no signs of forced                     
                       entry. I've also checked out the                     
                       crime scene, but we didn't see any
                       fingerprints on the glass. The
                       suspect was probably wearing
                       gloves.

          Ronnie tacks up pictures of all of the      robbery "suspects"    
          on a bulletin board. It's pictures of       Saddamn and the       
          Devil Worshipper guy. Beside him is a       sketch of the         
          Pervert. The images are on the bottom       points of a           
          Pyramid.                                                          
          
          On top of the Pyramid is a combination drawing/picture of         
          Ronnie. The body is drawn with his arms folded across             
          his chest and a photo of his face is tacked on top. The           
          whole thing adds up to nonsense, with the only clear idea         
          is that he defeats them all. Ronnie sits back in his

                       something. I'm not really sure                     
                       how to put this. Let's see. If                     
                       you drove a Toyota.

                       I know, but let's just pretend you                 
                       drove a Toyota. Now, this Toyota                   
                       runs really good. It always                        
                       starts when you need it to and it                  
                       gets good gas mileage and you                      
                       don't have to do much to maintain                  
                       it. Then you get a really                          
                       important job like Astronaut, no                   
                       that won't work, you get a job as                  
                       the head of Wall Street. Well,                     
                       you may really like that Toyota,                   
                       but you're going to feel weird                     
                       about driving it to work every                     
                       day, right? Now let's say that                     
                       somebody offers you a chance to                    
                       get rid of that Toyota and instead                 
                       you get a Ferrari. It may be more                  
                       expensive and harder to drive, but                 
                       I mean, it just looks good as                      
                       hell. What would you do?

          Ronnie comes out of the closet and he's wearing a

          smiling, but Dennis isn't saying a word as usual.

                       Dennis. I told you I wouldn't                       
                       talk.                                               
          
          Ronnie sits back, but he can't help a giant grin on his          
          face.

                       I'm serious, Dennis. A gentleman                  
                       never kisses and tells. So, just                  
                       stop with all the pressure because

                       details. I had sex with Brandi                    
                       last night.

                       but let me tell you, this was so                  
                       much better. You know how many                    
                       times we did it? Twice! BAM!

          Nell, who looks like she's been crying nonstop, stuffs a       
          whole Cinnabon into her face. As it fills her cheeks,          
          she looks over to Ronnie's table and sees Ronnie making        
          thrusting motions at the table. Nell swallows, stuffs          
          another Cinnabon in, then storms out of the Food Court.

                       was steamy and sexy, but more than                
                       anything, I should tell you that                  
                       it's her soul that I fell for the                 
                       most. She got pretty tanked, but                  
                       I could just really tell that                     
                       she's a good person. The kind of                  
                       person that I could see myself                    
                       with.

          Nell watches Brandi as she pops a couple of aspirin

                       several steps you have to complete
                       in order to be eligible for the
                       police academy. Physical
                       evaluation, psychological test,
                       background check.

                       Now, I like to tell all new
                       recruits that they should complete
                       a ride along before making this
                       decision. It's where you actually
                       ride along with a real police
                       officer during a routine patrol.
                       It helps give you an idea of the
                       kind of situations you'll be
                       dealing with. Sound good?

                       That's right, but myself and the
                       other officers worked on cleaning
                       it up for years so that the good
                       folks of this neighborhood
                       wouldn't have to worry about being
                       safe. Yes, sir, that corner is a
                       testament to the fine police work
                       of our force.

                       easy. We still patrol this area

          Ronnie   opens the door and gets out of the car. As he
          exits,   a car drives by BLARING RAP MUSIC. The passenger
          throws   a beer bottle at Ronnie. He dodges it and the
          bottle   shatters on the ground.
          
          Ronnie is shaken, but he waves to Detective Harrison like
          he's okay. Detective Harrison waves back, then PEELS OUT
          OF THERE. Ronnie is confused.

          Ronnie waves to the bum. The bum runs his finger under

          A group of KIDS walk by Ronnie talking loudly.

                       Because I'm proud to report that I
                       passed the test. I know you
                       wanted to see if I had the chops
                       to cut it on the police force and
                       I'm glad to say that I passed. I
                       knew I would get initiated some
                       time, but I didn't think it would
                       be so soon. Thank you, Detective
                       Harrison. Thank you for believing
                       in me.

                       You don't have to say anything.
                       Your actions speak for themselves.                   
                       Thank you for giving this rookie a
                       shot. Get used to seeing Ronnie
                       Barnhardt around here, boys.
          
          
          BAD-ASS PHYSICAL EXAM MONTAGE - INT. TRAINING FIELD -
          DAY
          
          SPRINT: The TESTING OFFICER blows a whistle and starts
          the 100 meter dash. Ronnie jumps off the starting line
          and hauls ass down the track. The other Trainees fall
          behind Ronnie as he smokes their asses.
          
          PULL-UPS: Ronnie jumps on the bar and begins to do pull-
          up after pull-up.
          
          SIDE SLIDE: The Testing Officer blows a whistle and
          Ronnie begins to shuffle side to side like an ice skater
          that never moves forward.
          
          SIT-UPS:     Ronnie goes hard on the sit-ups.
          
          OBSTACLE COURSE: Ronnie sprints up a wall and flips to
          the other side. He charges a body of water, then jumps
          onto the rope and swings safely to the other side.

          INT. MALL - NIGHT
          
          All the lights are off and we see the dark shadow creep
          through the darkness.
          
          The shadow breaks into the SHOE STORE and grabs as many           
          pairs of sneakers that it can carry. The shadow opens             
          the sliding cage and closes it from the other side. Then          
          bends down and locks it.
          
                                                                82.

                    Is it, Ronnie? I mean, the mall                    
                    is getting butchered in the press.                 
                    Somebody who works here is ripping                 
                    the place off. The cops don't                      
                    have any leads. I'm getting shit                   
                    from the owner of the mall. Sales                  
                    are down. I mean, what's so good                   
                    about this morning?

                    I feel your pain, Mark. Quite                      
                    frankly, there's two things                        
                    happening. One, I'm lacking a                      
                    sufficient firearm. And two,                       
                    we're understaffed. That's why I

          training.
          
          Ronnie comes walking up and takes a long look at the
          building. Ronnie smiles to himself and heads up the
          stairs.
          
          Ronnie reaches the top where Detective Harrison is
          waiting. Ronnie stops.

          Harrison reaches over Brandi and opens her door.

          Harrison pushes Brandi out of the car and shuts himself           
          back in.

                    fact, shit is seriously fucked up.
                    I've got to protect the whole mall
                    by myself. Now, I got you this

                    stop being a little baby and do
                    something for a change.

                    You know, Dennis, for the longest
                    time I made this job my whole
                    life. I looked at this mall as a
                    kingdom and I looked at Mark as
                    the King. I thought of myself as
                    the first Knight and the
                    customers, well, they were the
                    peasants. I lived by an old code
                    where one was bound by duty and
                    honor. But now I don't know if I
                    believe in that code anymore.
                    I've lost my way. Now I just feel
                    like it's one big kingdom of shit.
                    Right now, I got half a mind just                  
                    to let this whole place burn.                      
                    Burn it to the fucking ground!

          Dennis stares down at the desk. Dennis takes off his hat
          and reveals that he has bleached white Eminem hair
          underneath. Next, he reaches under his collar and flips
          out a thin gold necklace. He kicks up his shoes and
          reveals the newest and freshest basketball kicks.

                       got to be willing to accept it. So
                       I'm gonna ask you now, Ronnie. Are

          Dennis and Ronnie hang in the back of the mall by the
          dumpsters. Dennis sucks down a fat joint. He passes it
          to Ronnie.

                       So, yeah, usually I take a joint
                       straight to the head before I
                       start work in this motherfucker,
                       but on really stressful days, I
                       like to get drunk too.
          
          Dennis pulls out a flask and gulps it down. Ronnie is
          still staring at the joint. Finally he takes a puff and
          begins violently coughing. He finally stops.

                       Dressing rooms are a great place
                       to hide out, because nobody is
                       really going to think of looking
                       for me here. You can nap or just
                       kind of hang out and just really
                       have some personal time. Hey,
                       hand me that camera.
          
          Ronnie picks up a shitty camera and hands it to Dennis.

          Dennis stands up on the bench and looks into the other

                       here in case I got out of hand?                      
                       Well, get ready to earn your                         
                       money.                                               
          
          Ronnie cracks. He grabs a calendar and throws it on the           
          ground in a violent baby-like outburst.                           
          
                                     MARK                                   
                       Stop him!                                            
          
          Charles tries to grab Ronnie, but Ronnie pushes him off.          
          Ronnie knocks the framed pictures off of the wall. He
          then opens the door and slams it into the wall over and
          over again. That does nothing. Ronnie tries to rip the
          cushion on the chair. He looks ridiculous.
          
                                     CHARLES                                
                       Alright, Ronnie, that's enough.                      
          
          Ronnie stops and begins to cry.     Then he runs out of the
          office in tears.

          Ronnie lies in his bed and we...
          
          TIME LAPSE: The sun rises and sets three times through
          the window of his bedroom, signifying that three days
          have passed. The whole time, Ronnie doesn't move from
          his bed.
          
          Until...
          
          Ronnie gets on his "nice" clothes, but they're a far cry
          from his Security Guard uniform. Ronnie's Mom comes up
          to him.

                       Ronnie, you may not be smart or
                       handsome, but you've got dreams
                       inside of you and dreams make you
                       special. No matter what this
                       world tries to throw at you, they
                       can never take those dreams away.

                       I don't know. I'm drunk. I just
                       know that mothers are supposed to

                       gig was one of the best jobs I                       
                       ever had. I got to wear a                            
                       uniform, I could smoke weed                          
                       whenever I wanted. For once in my                    
                       life, I felt like I was actually                     
                       somebody. I know most people                         
                       don't think it's shit, but I                         
                       really loved it. Then, all of a                      
                       sudden, I find out that your ass                     
                       got promoted over me.

                       I'll spend the rest of my life                       
                       making it up to you. And you can

          Nell thinks about it.    She leans over the table and             
          kisses Ronnie.                                                    
          
          Ronnie is stunned. With one kiss, Nell seems to make              
          everything okay. They stare at each other and the moment          
          seems to hold for an eternity. Love is in the air
          until...
          
          THE PERVERT STEPS IN FRONT OF THEM AND EXPOSES HIS DING-
          A-LING!

          Ronnie realizes that this is his duty and his alone.
          Ronnie rises from the table slowly. He looks at Nell and
          nods acceptance. Then, Ronnie runs after the Pervert.
          
          
          INT. MALL - DAY
          
          The Pervert is in a full blown run through the mall. His
          trench coat is wide open and his wienie is flapping for
          the world to see. In a way, it's his greatest
          accomplishment. People scream! Mothers grab their
          daughters! No one is safe!

          Ronnie comes ripping out of the food court. He's got a
          fierce look of determination in his eyes. He runs hard
          to catch up with the Perv.

          There's a crowd surrounding the Cell Phone Kiosk. The
          Pervert bursts through the crowd and knocks people out of
          the way.

          The crowd totally clears a path for Ronnie, but Ronnie
          stops running and SUCKER PUNCHES SADDAMN. Saddamn goes            
          down hard and Ronnie rejoins the chase.

          Stevie slides his skateboard out for Ronnie to jump on.
          Ronnie jumps like he is going to land on the skateboard           
          and sail to the finish line. However, when Ronnie's feet          
          touch the board, it goes shooting out from under him.             
          Ronnie slams onto the ground. All of the skaters start            
          laughing.

          Ronnie picks himself up and starts to run again. He only
          makes it a little ways before he hits something slippery.         
          Ronnie falls onto the ground and cracks his head.
          
          Ronnie lays on the ground and sees Ramon laughing against

          He looks like he's charging straight at Brandi.    He's         
          getting closer.
          
          BOOM! Ronnie comes in from the side and nails the
          Pervert with the flashlight. Ronnie jumps on top of the
          Perv and beats the ever-living shit out of him. This is
          a vision of a man leaving all out on the field.
          
          Ronnie stops pounding and looks up. He sees Brandi              
          staring at him. Ronnie is overcome by anger and beats on
          the Pervert harder than ever before. Finally, Charles           
          comes in and pulls Ronnie off of him.
          
          A huge crowd has gathered around. Ronnie has blood all
          over him. Ronnie picks the Pervert up and holds him
          tightly by the arms. Mark comes running up.

          INT. GOLF CART - DAY
          
          Ronnie is stuck in traffic. He looks ridiculous in the
          orange golf cart on a city street with a Pervert chained
          up beside him, but Ronnie could care less.
          
          
          EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY
          
          The golf cart pulls up to the police station and Ronnie
          gets out with the Perv. Ronnie walks up the front steps
          and all of the officers part and let him through.
          
          Detective Harrison is at the top of the stairs.      Ronnie
          walks right up to him.

                       I see that. Well, you better turn
                       him over to me and I'll take him
                       inside and book him.

                                     DETECTIVE HARRISON
                       Hey, Ronnie, you may not be an                       
                       officer of the law, but you're the

          Ronnie lets go of the Pervert. He nods to Harrison, then          
          turns his back and walks back down the steps. Ronnie
          gets into his golf cart and drives away.

          Ronnie stands in front of the Mall with Nell beside him.          
          Ronnie looks nervous, but Nell looks down at her yellow           
          ring with pride. She looks at Ronnie, sees a loose                
          eyelash and brushes it off of him.

                       Good evening. We're here today                       
                       with Ronnie Barnhardt, head of                       
                       Mall Security here at Carolina                       
                       Mall. Last week, Ronnie was able                     
                       to catch The CAROLINA MALL FLASHER                   
                       single-handed and bring him to                       
                       justice. Ronnie, how did you                         
                       manage to find the identity of The                   
                       Pervert and take him down?

                       Well, being a mall security guard
                       basically requires the same skill
                       set that someone in say the FBI
                       has. You have to use logic and
                       evidence and old-fashioned common
                       sense as well as the latest
                       technology to deduce the criminal
                       mind. It's what I do.
          
          All of a sudden, STEVIE AND THE SKATERS come up behind            
          Ronnie. They look into the camera lens and start                  
          smiling. Ronnie turns around and sees them, but tries to          
          focus on the reporter.

          The Skaters start flipping off the camera.       Ronnie keeps
