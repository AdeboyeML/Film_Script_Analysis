          Annie is in nice lingerie, happily getting ready for the
          day. She puts a lot of effort into her appearance.
          Products everywhere, too many hair-flips, eye-cream, no
          hair out of place.
          She walks into the bedroom, where TED, a gorgeous man
          sleeps. She sneaks back into the bed, carefully
          positioning herself and moving the sheets to show her
          good parts.
          She coughs and nudges Ted to wake him up then pretend
          sleeps.

                         TED
          Good morning.
          Annie pretends to wake up.

                         TED (CONT'D)
          Wow, you look beautiful.

          What? No. I don't. Oh my God its the
          morning. I look terrible. I just woke up.

                         TED
          Last night was fun.

                         ANNIE
          Yeah, I had the best time. I have't had
          that much fun on a first date in years,
          ever...
          She brushes the hair off his forehead as if he were her
          long time lover.

                         TED
          So listen Annie, I like you. So, I want
          to be up front with you. I'm not really
          looking for a relationship right now.
          Annie's eyes grow large. She uncomfortably smiles at him,
          nodding.

          Oooooo. Oops. I mean, yeah. What?

          And honestly, (sits up) I don't even know
          how I feel about the whole monogamy
          thing, is one person really enough for
          anyone? I mean, I like to be with a lot
          of different people.

                         ANNIE
          It is sooo refreshing to hear you say
          that, because isn't that what everyone
          thinks but is afraid to say? I mean, i's
          science. I'm-I don't want a relationship
          either. Let's just say that. And I
          wouldn't even care whatever you do or I
          do, I just wanna have tons of fun, like
          no strings attached at all. I'm just
          different from other girls.

          going. I was gonna get a haircut today.

                         ANNIE
          Yeah, they say that every couple months
          it's good to trim the ends, you know, get
          all the dead stuff. So, cool. Cool. 've
          cut hair before.

          Lillian is getting dressed. Upscale, professional

          It's summer?! What the hell does that

          No! But I gave him a blow job.

          Well, he kept putting it in my face.
          Lillian's boyfriend DOUGIE enters the bedroom eating a
          Luna Bar in his sweats. He's stretching and flexing his
          muscles trying to make her laugh.

          Baby, look how hard I worked out. Look at
          all this sweat.

                         LILLIAN
          Can you see that I'm on the phone? I'm
          talking to Annie.

                         DOUGIE
          Hey Annie.

                         LILLIAN
          Are you eating my Luna Bar? Those are for
          women you know?

          It's not gonna do anything to you.

                         DOUGIE
          Oh my God. My breasts are getting bigger.
          He tries to rub up against Lillian.

                         LILLIAN
          Ew, go take a shower.
          Dougie leaves.

          I'm gonna play with my new boobs in
          there.

                         LILLIAN
          I swear I cannot handle him right now. He
          has been driving me crazy. Sometimes it
          feels like I'm kissing my brother. I
          don't know what do.
          Annie pulls into an alleyway behind HARRINGTO'S JEWELRY
          STORE and starts changing into her work uniform in the
          car. A white blouse and navy skirt.

          OK, so you had a first date last night.
          Did you bring him a present?
          Annie is silent.

          Ann, what did I tell you?

          I brought him lemon-bars because I was

          Sweetheart...did I ever tell you the
          story of the little paralyzed Chinese
          girl who wanted to be dancer?

          Many times.

                         DONNA
          She was paralyzed Annie, had no feeling
          in her legs, and then one day after years
          of believing in herself, she stood up out
          of that chair and tap-danced for the
          king. On his birthday! My point is, Sandy
          makes a real effort around here. He
          connects with the customer. And when he
          wants to make a sale, he goes for it.

          Uhh! A wasp! Who walks around even their

          so many cupboards!

          INT. ANNIE AND STEVE'S APT. THAT NIGHT.

          STEVE, Annie's mid-thirties roommate, sits on the couch
          shirtless and is enthralled by the show.

                         STEVE
          Noooo. That's, that's sooo smart.
          Annie enters the apartment, tired. She throws her keys
          down and sifts through her mail. Steve presses mute.

          STEVE (CONT'D)
          There you are, you stayer-out-all-
          nighter. Did you make out? Sleep over?
          As Annie heads for her bedroom, he walks towards her
          room.

          STEVE (CONT'D)
          Don't go in the bathroom. Are you going
          to bed?

                         ANNIE
          Yes. I'm beat.

                         STEVE
          Your ex-boyfriend got more mail, I did
          what you said and just threw it away.

                         ANNIE
          Thanks. Goodnight Steve!
          She shuts the door behind her.

          That credit lady called! She wants to
          talk to you, Annie! She's gonna find you.

          She sits on her bed grabs a âSounds to Relaxâ CD with a
          post-it that reads, âLove, Momâ. She plays it and lies
          down. We hear a loud Tibetan woma's voice wailing. NOT
          relaxing. She turns it off and curls up on top of her
          bed.

          It's a short grey-haired OUTDOORSEY WOMAN in hiking
          boots. They laugh to themselves. Annie keeps reading.

          That's not I mean. I mean, I remember

          your virginity to him right in front of
          me on the dock, remember?

          I've never been in a wedding.

                         LILLIAN
          It's no big deal, and I don't want to
          make it one. It's not gonna be a big
          crazy thing. I wanna keep it simple.
          (beat) What dessert are you gonna get?

                         ANNIE
          I know what you're doing. Don't downplay
          this. I'm happy for you. And someday when
          hell freezes over and I get married, you
          can be my Maid of Honor. But for right
          now, this is about you. OK? This is
          you're day, and it is a big deal.

                         LILLIAN
          Ok, but I still don't want this to be a
          huge production. I just want to have all
          my friends meet each other, have fun,
          dance, drink, whatever.

                         ANNIE
          Then that's what it'll be. Did you guys
          set a date?

                         LILLIAN
          Oh God, not yet. I don't want a super
          long engagement, but there's a lot to do.

          Well you are very fortunate because you
          happen have the best maid of honor in the
          whole wide world, and--

          It's kinda funny right? That when girls
          are ugly, they're called dogs, but dogs
          are cute.
          Annie laughs. He half smiles but does not respond.

          ANNIE (CONT'D)
          (beat) Well, some dogs are ugly. Some
          girls are ugly. I know a lot of ugly
          girls. But I'm not friends with them.
          I've seen a lot of ugly dogs too. But
          some people I know who are considered
          dogs, you know, they have a good
          personality, and are better looking to
          people cuz of that. And people who are
          not nice...that's ugly to me. And female
          dogs are called bitches, that's weird.
          I'm just kidding. It's a joke. I have
          better ones.

          Oh, he saw me alright. He was married to
          me for fourteen years, he knows what I

          Shhh, I got it at Glory Gay's.

                         MARY
          Ooooh. I can't even walk in there. The
          blouses alone make my wallet open.

                         LAURIE
          It's worth it, though huh? Mary, I want
          you to meet Lillian's Maid of Honor.

          This is Annie Walker. She lived next door
          to us in Milwaukee until the girls
          graduated from high school.

          LAURIE (TO MARY)
          Her father ran off to Florida with a
          younger woman who was working at a
          Chrysler dealership.

          Oh my.

                         LAURIE
          Poor Judy, never quite got over it. She
          also ended up moving to Florida to take
          care of her parents.

                         MARY
          Oh, that is tough. Well it's nice Annie
          and Lillian have stayed friends.

          This place is so fancy. Dougie's parents
          belong here?

                         LILLIAN
          Yeah. So does Dougie. This is the tennis
          club I've been playing at.

                         ANNIE
          Oh. Wow. I guess it's not what I
          pictured. Lucky you.

                         LILLIAN
          Tennis courts are tennis courts if you
          ask me. But I have met a lot of really
          cool people here. I can't wait for you to
          meet the girls.

                         ANNIE
          Oh! So where's this guy you were telling
          me about?

          LILLIAN.
          Oh shoot, Matt's not coming. I guess he
          got back together with his ex or
          something. Anyway, Dougie just told me.
          Sorry.

                         ANNIE

          Dougie picks Annie up and swings her around.

                         LILLIAN
          Dougie, be careful. God, you reek!
          He puts her down.

                         DOUGIE
          Annie, make sure when my fiance gets cold
          feet you tell her what a great guy I am.
          He grabs Lillian and kisses her on the cheek.

                         LILLIAN
          (waving the cigar scent away) Ugh. Wash
          your face.

          Well, I just squeezed my third kid out
          last month and I feel like I'm walking
          around in a fat suit.
          She swigs beer out of a bottle.

                         PAUL
          I keep telling her she looks great.
          (beat) Oh, I'm sorry. Is this your
          boyfriend?
          A 30 YEAR OLD AVERAGE GUY with a neckbrace stands behind

          Everyone! We can't all have the dress
          that we want. I've been in a lot of
          weddings and when choosing a bridesmaid

          Very few HPV infections show any signs or

          people don't even know they have it, yet

          Nah... The reason I pulled you over

          A lot of people get up to high speeds on

          Annie pulls out a very dry, warped discolored carrot.

          No. I think you should eat it. The're

          He goes to eat it. She grabs it out of his hands.

          It's an ok job. It's commission, so it's

          wanted to finish my bachelor's but that's
          kind of financially impossible right now.

          like a hallway of doors. You can stand at
          the same door forever if you want. Or you
          can open a different door. And that one
          may not be the right door, but i'll open
          up a whole new hallway of doors. Anyway,
          it worked for me. I was kinda lost and I
          opened a door and the next thing I knew I
          was a cop. And I love my job.

          Moonpies. What?

                         RHODES

          borrowed $30,000 in my name without
          telling me, putting me in horrible debt

          No, everyone pays for themselves. And you
          pay for the bride.

                         STEVE
          Ok, I'm gonna say no. You cannot afford
          that. Vegas is not cheap. Airfare,
          hotels, food, cars, drinks, clubs, show
          tickets. Remember this morning? You
          cannot afford Vegas.

          Well it's not just Sea World. It's a
          weekend in Florida. See, when Lillian and
          I were kids we went there and she loved
          it and has always talked about going
          back. Ask Dougie. I think it would really
          mean a lot to her. We could stay at my
          Dad's house, he won't even be there. Then
          we could go out at night and got to the
          beach and then Sea World on one of the
          days.

          That's where we went for for MY
          bachelorette.

          It's super old though! They have awesome

          I gotta be honest. I've been married for
          nine years, this may be the last
          bachelorette party of my career and I
          want the sweaty nuggets of a gay man
          pounding me in the face at some point

          INT. JUNGLE LOUNGE.

          Annie walks through the club. She calls Lillian. No
          answer. She gets a a drink. Time passes. Her phone rings!

          INT. PARTY BUS.

          Loud music. Lillian tries to call Annie back. Annie tries
          to call Lillian back. They both get voice-mails. Annie
          gives up. It starts pouring rain on her inside the club.
          Everyone jumps up and screams with excitement. Thunder!

          CLUB D.J.
          Me Tarzan, you Jane. It's time for the
          dance spotlight. If it lands on you, you
          gotta shake it!
          The spotlight immediately lands on a soaking wet Annie.
          She dances very angrily. Jungle dancers dance very close
          to her and put vines around her neck.

          INT. BAR NEXT DOOR

          Annie walks in.

          Roller, I can't stand seeing you like

                         ANNIE
          That's what I'm saying. Some people have
          everything and others have just little
          bits of things. It's not fair. I don't
          get it.....I mean I think I hate Helen.

                         DAVE
          I hate Helen.

                         ANNIE
          That is the sexiest think anyon's ever
          said.

          INT. ANNIE'S ROOM. HOTEL RICK.

          In the dark, Annie and Dave are passionately making out.
          Knocking things over, etc.

                         DAVE
          I hate Helen.

          NEXT MORNING. ANNIE'S HOTEL ROOM
          The cat jumps on the bed and meows. Annie opens her eyes
          to see Dave sleeping. She notices his college tattoo on
          his arm (tasmanian devil with a lacrosse stick?).

                         DAVE
          Hey.

                         ANNIE
          Hi. Sorry I fell asleep while we were
          making out. I guess I was pretty tired.

                         DAVE
          Its ok. Sorry I gave you a hickey.

                         ANNIE
          Oh shit.
          There's a knock at the door. Annie opens it to reveal
          NICOLE, (20), pretty and sweet.

                         NICOLE
          Is Dave here?

                         DAVE
          Nicole!? Hey, Nic.

                         NICOLE

          Brian 1, Brian 2 and Mark appear in the doorway as well.

                         BRIAN 1
          Dude, I'm sorry. She made us bring her
          here.

                         MARK
          She said you have her fake I.D..

                         NICOLE
          Yeah and I couldn't go anywhere last
          night. I tried calling you fifty fucking
          times. And YOU? You were what, hooking up
          with this fossil?!

                         ANNIE
          First of all-

                         NICOLE
          Shut the fuck up or I will kick your ass
          bitch.

                         ANNIE
          Ok, that is not nice.

                         NICOLE
          And what are you forty?

                         ANNIE
          No, I'm in my low thirties...(under her
          breath) and you could never kick my ass.

                         NICOLE
          What did you say?!

                         ANNIE
          (timid) You heard me.
          Annie immediately gets punched in the face. Annie is
          shocked and swings back, hitting Nicole in the face.
          She's proud of herself. Nicole's two friends enter and
          jump on Annie. HUGE GIRL FIGHT.

          EXT. HOTEL RICK. FIVE MINUTES LATER.

          Annie is outside of the hotel. Guys are pulling the girls
          off of Annie.

                         NICOLE

          The girls leave in victory. Dave turns and mouths to
          Annie âI'm sorry.â

          INT. ANNIE'S HOTEL BATHROOM.

          She frantically tries to cover up her HUGE hickey and
          evidence of the fight, with make-up. She remembers a
          small cowboy print tablecloth from the other room and
          wraps it around her neck like a scarf.

          INT. THE NEW MARQUIS ROYAL SUITES. BUFFET TABLE

          All the girls are hung over and eating. Annie arrives.

                         MEGAN
          Annie!

                         LILLIAN
          Whoa. What are you, going to a rodeo?

                         ANNIE
          That's hilarious.

                         MEGAN
          Annie, you missed it. I scammed all night
          last night. I met this guy named Darwin.
          He works for Cingular. He had a friend.

                         LESLIE
          What happened to your face?

                         LILLIAN
          Yeah, why are you wearing all that
          makeup?

                         ANNIE
          It's covering up bruises, cuts and a
          hickey. I got into fight with a community
          college student and her friends because I
          spent the night with her boyfriend after
          spending the entire night trying to find
          you.

                         LILLIAN

                         ANNIE
          Well, I-(to Lil} Can I talk to you for a
          minute?
          Annie takes Lillian away.

                         LILLIAN
          What is going on? You told Helen you were
          sick.

                         ANNIE
          I wasn't sick. Helen told you that
          because... I couldn't afford to go with
          you guys.

                         LILLIAN
          Why didn't you say something?--

          don't wanna be rude.

          That's funny. You know what? As the Maid
          of honor, which is what I am and what you
          are not, I am asking you to just give us
          a minute.

          She lives here! She lives in Vegas.

                         HELEN
          You're not going to run into her. Just
          shut-up about it.

                         LILLIAN
          Guys stop! Please! Annie, I'm so sorry
          about last night. I feel horrible. I want
          to hear everything that happened.
          Tonight, you're not leaving my side.
          We're hittin' the strip club all of us
          and we're going to put this shit behind
          us. Okay?!
          The girls agree. Dana rubs her arm.

          A siren goes off.

          V.O.
          Good evening ladies, and welcome to
          Thunderbird. Our first male entertainer
          has been roaming the prairie for many,
          many lonely nights...
          A horse winnies. Ladies scream.

          V.O. (CONT'D)
          Here he is...looking for a sweet lady to
          keep him company under the stars...say
          hello to Cowboy Ron!
          A male stripper comes out on a cardboard horse, humping

                         'S
          looking for someone. The room goes wild.

          V.O. (CONT'D)
          There he is ladies looking for that
          special woman, looking for his
          briiide...And I believe the person he's
          looking for is Lillian Donovan!
          The girls scream. Lillian mouths to Annie âI'm gonna kill
          you.â Cowboy Ron takes her up on stage. He puts her in a
          chair and humps her face. Everyone is cracking up.

          Leslie, your missing it.

          Don't talk to me. Nobody talk to me.
          Leslie has her hands on the bare ass of a stripper who is
          dancing in her face.
          Stripper #2 appears.

          V.O.
          Wow, looks like Cowboy Ron has a friend
          on the prairie and he's lookin' for a

          NO! NO!
          Stripper #2 pulls Annie up to the stage, lays her on the
          ground and simulates sex with her. Standing above her,
          pulls his chaps off. We see that his balls are not all
          the way tucked into his g-string. The girls cringe. As he
          stands above her, in slow motion, we see a bead of sweat
          leave his balls and fly into Anni's open laughing mouth.
          She dry heaves. The stripper is oblivious, goes to
          another girl.
          Lillian and Annie roll around on the ground laughing.

          You're stupid.

                         GIRL
          You have no chin.

                         ANNIE
          You're gonna be a slut in high school.

                         GIRL
          You are an old, single loser who has no
          friends, works in a jewelry store, colors
          her own hair, and will never know the
          feeling of owning a luxury car.

          (quietly] You. Little. Cunt.
          The girls eyes widen. The camera pans to show that the
          girl's dad and Donna have been there the whole time.

          INT. DONNA'S OFFICE

          Donna stands across from Annie wh's cleaning out her
          locker. She sadly starts to leave.

                         ANNIE
          Bye.

                         DONNA
          You know, I knew a girl once. Karen
          Stippleton. She was really something. The
          life of the party, a concert pianist, she
          had naturally curly hair, and skin black
          as night. But one evening at a dinner
          party I walked in on her in the bathroom
          putting a vile of cocaine up her buttocks
          and last I heard, she was playing the
          saxophone outside of a drug store. And
          I'm gonna say something to you I should
          have told her. Don't waste your life.
          Find out what your gifts are and use
          them.
          Donna hugs Annie, then leaves her in the break room.

          INT. ANNIE'S APARTMENT. LATER THAT DAY.

          Annie arrives completely depressed. Outside her doorstep
          is yet another package. Annie takes it inside.

          INT. ANNIE'S APT.


                         STEVE
          Ooh, another package from your mom?

                         ANNIE
          Yep.
          It is a beautiful pink and white striped box with her
          name and address in calligraphy. When Annie opens the
          lid, âCanon in Dâ plays and a real butterfly flies out.

          She reads, âA Shower for Lillian.â Steve comes over to
          see.
          On one side of the box, there is a beautiful sculpture of
          Lillian and Dougie as Bride and Groom, a candle with
          Lillian's face printed on it and some chocolates. Annie
          takes the invitation out, opens it quickly.

          ANNIE (CONT'D)
          Are you kidding me?
          The invitation reads:

          Annie's relaxation CD is playing as she lies talking on
          the phone to her Mom, who is painting a very life-like
          picture of Enrique Iglesias in concert.

                         JUDY
          Is there an animal over there?

          No, it's a C.D.
          She rolls over and turns it off.

          So, I'm flying straight to O'Hare the day
          of the shower cause I wanna get my hair
          done. Did you see that invitation? I
          didn't get the significance of the dead

          have fun.

          It's gonna be uncomfortable and weird...I
          don't wanna go.

                         JUDY
          Sweetie, listen to yourself. You ca't
          let her new friends get in the way of
          your being a part of one of the best days
          of Lil's life. NO way. You have a history
          with her that no one else has. So you

          INT. ANNIE'S CAR.

          Annie drives to Helen's. She sees a pink and white
          highway sign (that looks like a traditional highway exit
          sign) âLillian's Shower Rue. This exitâ

                         ANNIE
          Oh my God.
          She turns into the gates of âWhitewater Estates.â There
          is, a life-size sculpture of a bride and groom. As she
          gets closer, she sees they are real life models. They
          smile at Annie, wink at her and wave her by.
          At the next stop sign, a butler appears with a tray.

                         BUTLER
          Are you a guest of Helen Harris?

                         ANNIE
          Yes.

                         BUTLER
          The shower is one mile away.
          He hands her a pink lemonade.

                         ANNIE
          I don't have a cup-holder.
          As she's driving, little pink things start to fly beside
          her car.

          ANNIE (CONT'D)

                         WHAT THE-
          One flies in her car. They're Rose petals!
          Annie's shitty car drives down a road covered with Rose
          petals. At the driveway, she is greeted by a valet in a
          pink bow-tie and beret. As she reaches for her gift from
          the passenger seat, another valet opens that door and
          take it.

                         VALET
          This will be placed in the gift room for
          you madame.
          He reaches for the cookies she made, and she stops him.

                         ANNIE
          I'll take those.

          Annie watches the valet drives her car away. When she
          turns back around, there is a man with a white horse
          holding out his hand to her.

                         HORSEMAN
          Would you like an assisted ride to the
          main house?

                         ANNIE
          Do I have to?
          An annoyed Annie arrives at the house on the horse with
          the man leading her on foot, holding the cookies. She
          dismounts.
          The front door is swung open by two attendants. As she
          enters the mansion, groups of girls pass by her...

                         SHOWER GIRLS
          This is the most amazing shower 've ever
          been to/Can you believe this?/What a
          lucky bride/What a good friend...
          Helen's house is ALL cream and white with gold. Couches
          are puffy, etc. Annie walks to the backyard. We hear
          French standards. Beautiful tables are set. Swans and
          bunnies milling about. Attendants ready to serve. In the
          middle of everything stands an eight foot tall round
          âsignâ that says âLillian and Dougieâ in puffy pink
          cursive. A waiter offers Annie champagne. She takes it.

          BECCA AND LESLIE(O.S.)
          Annie!
          They walk to her.

                         LESLIE
          Do you believe this shit?
          Annie is still staring at the sign.

                         BECCA
          That's a big cookie huh.

                         ANNIE
          Where?
          They point to the âsignâ. Annie walks closer to see it is
          indeed a huge cookie.

                         LESLIE

          It's even better if you dip it in the
          chocolate.
          REVEAL a glorious four tiered chocolate fountain. Girls
          are around it dipping strawberries and pieces of the big
          cookie, laughing. Helen is there taking their praise.
          Annie is pissed and plops her tupperware of cookies on a
          nearby table.

                         LILLIAN
          Annieee!!!
          Lillian runs to her.

          I said I love this shower, and i's
          amazing. I said all that.
          Annie leaves. Two hip hop dancers wearing pink berets
          approach Helen and jam out in her face.

          INT-HELENS POWDER ROOM
          Annie puts lotion her hands. She sees a magazine photo of

                         'S
          face super imposed over them. On the counter is a framed

          face. She also sees a photo of Helen and Lillian from

          As Annie leaves, she runs into her Mom, wh's new
          hairstyle is a bit overdone.

          them. I gotta go tell Lillian.

          EXT- HELEN'S BACK YARD- MOMENTS LATER
          Annie now stands next to the chocolate fountain. She
          looks around, drops her glass in it and unplugs it with
          her foot. It stops flowing. She looks around and throws
          some leaves in it and walks away.

          Everyone sits surrounded by decorations, pictures of
          Dougie and Lillian as babies, flowers, fire in the
          fireplace.

                         DANA
          Everyone it's game time! Please take your
          piece of paper, put it on top of your
          head, and with your other hand try to
          draw what Lillian and Dougie's first baby
          is going to look like!!! Ready? GO!
          Everyone draws, giggles, looks at their stupid drawings,
          laughing. Annie cheats and draws it on her lap.

          Find the veil! C'mon Ellie! Come on Look!
          You can do it! It's right there!
          Ellie feels around in the huge pile of pillows. She finds
          the veil, holds it up in victory and then falls down from
          dizziness.

          Doesn't it? Smells bad. This house has a
          weird smell.

          What is the craziest place Lillian and
          Dougie....?
          Helen strongly hints with a weird smile instead of
          saying, â...had sex?â Shower Girls Ooooh and Ahhhh.

          sailing but you can ride the waves
          together.
          Dana cries and takes a picture. Everyone applauds,

          girl starts crying.
          Annie walks back through the house, through the crowd
          holding her chocolate covered hands in the air.

          I actually thought I wanted to be like

          bad choices. I'm broke, I lost my stupid
          job, I'm thirty two years old and I still
          answer booty calls. I don't like Mike
          Donahue cause he () on our date. I have
          a single black hair that grows out of my
          chin and I can't wear white t-shirts
          cause something about my sweat turns the
          pits yellow! AND you know when we were in
          Vegas? When you were all staying at your
          luxury hotel? I was staying at Hotel RICK
          where got BODY LICE! So Helen, you can
          have the coveted Maid of Honor title. You
          can have it all wrapped up in a big pink

          Annie goes to get out of the car.

                         BECCA/DANA
          No!/ Annie don't get out!/ It's pitch
          dark out.

                         HELEN
          Everybody calm down. I'm calling 911.

                         LESLIE
          You don't call 911 for a flat tire!
          A huge truck drives by moving their car a little bit.
          The girls SCREAM!

                         ANNIE
          Guys! We're fine. Helen, put the hazards
          on.
          Helen puts them on.

          Helen, do you have a jack?

                         HELEN
          Probably?!

                         DANA
          What if we get hit just sitting here? Or
          kidnapped or chased by an animal?

                         ANNIE
          Dana calm down.

                         LESLIE
          Shit! I don't have any service.

                         BECCA
          Me neither!

                         DANA
          Oh my God! We're gonna die...
          Annie has had enough and gets out.
          The tire is definitely flat. She opens Hele's trunk,
          lifts the bottom (wherever the jack is in an Escalade]
          She goes up to the window.

          INT. HELEN'S ESCALADE. CONTINUOUS.


                         ANNIE
          Everyone's gotta get out, if you want me
          to fix this.
          They complain that its dangerous, i's cold, but they do.
          Annie puts the jack under car.

                         LESLIE
          So, how can I help?

                         ANNIE
          Hold the flashlight.
          Leslie and Megan watch as Annie pumps the jack. She
          really does know what she's doing! The car is raising.

          Megan hand me the wrench.
          Megan hands it to her. Annie starts to unscrew the lug
          nuts handing them to Megan, with Leslie by her side.
          Dana and Becca stand with Helen.

                         DANA
          That's pretty cool she knows how to do
          change a tire.

                         BECCA
          I know. I can't believe she's doing it.
          Dana and Becca move over to Annie. Helen waits alone.

                         HELEN
          Just don't scratch anything.
          The girls are all crouched down to watch Annie in awe.

                         DANA
          So what are you doing now?

                         ANNIE
          I'm removing the lug nuts so we can take
          the tire off.

                         BECCA
          How does that little thing lift the whole
          car?

                         MEGAN
          It uses hydraulic power. It gives a human
          being the lifting capacity of 1.5 to
          three tons.

                         LESLIE
          How do you know this stuff?

                         MEGAN
          I like cars. There's a real artistry to
          them.

                         HELEN
          Are you guys working or talking? We do't
          have all night.

                         DANA
          (quickly) Annie is doing the best she can
          Helen. So why don't you just stand over
          there and be quiet and wait.

          Excuse me?!
          Dana stands. She has had it with Helen.

                         DANA
          I said, will you, for once, shut the fuck
          up!!!??
          Dana approaches Helen. The other girls are standing now.

          DANA (CONT'D)
          Lillian probably left because of you
          anyway.

                         HELEN
          What!?

                         DANA
          You're so- bossy! You've been acting like
          you're in charge this whole time! Do't
          you realize how much pressure sh's
          under? You know, Lillian did not want to
          leave her reception in a unicorn-drawn
          carriage?! She said âThat's not me.â And
          you ordered it anyway! You've been
          pushing her this whole time! Annie was
          right.

                         MEGAN
          Yeah!
          Helen glares at Megan.

                         HELEN
          What are you talking about? The only
          reason you're even in this wedding is
          because you're the groom's sister.
          Weirdo.

                         MEGAN
          I'd rather be the groom's sister than
          have cameltoe from my $600 pants.
          We see that Helen has cameltoe. Megan has surprised them.

                         HELEN
          Why is everyone attacking me? I wasn't
          the one who caused a huge scene at
          Lillian's bridal shower and made her cry.

          I hate to interrupt this riveting
          discussion but a really creepy guy in a
          Trans Am just pulled over.
          The guy gets out of the car. He is thirty-ish, wears at-
          shirt with a cat on it and camouflage shorts.

          TRANS AM MAN
          Hey it's pretty late. What are you ladies
          doing?
          Becca and Dana scramble into the woods. Leslie gets
          behind the car.

                         ANNIE
          Just changing the tire.

          TRANS AM MAN
          You guys need some man hands for that?

                         ANNIE
          Nope I think we got it. But thank you.
          He doesn't leave, the girls worriedly look at each other.

          TRANS AM MAN
          Look, if you guys get tired, I live right
          up that hill. You ladies can just leave
          your car here, come on up and let us all
          lay down together.
          He starts to walk toward them. The girls are scared.
          Annie gives Megan a look. Megan tries to distract him.

                         MEGAN
          Hey! Are those snowflake rims?
          The guy looks at Megan.

          TRANS AM MAN
          Yeah, found âem in a junk yard. Restored
          âem myself.

          You don't say. I never met a lady in the
          FBC before.
          He walks over to Megan, she gives Annie a nod. Annie
          rushes to the tire and quickly continues changing it.

                         MEGAN
          You ever make it up to the Trans Am
          Nationals in Dayton?
          Becca, Dana, Leslie and Helen are huddled together. They
          talk in a loud whisper.

          It's my favorite movie. âGive me a Diablo

          quick . I'm in a goddamn hurry.â
          He leans into her.

          Why don't you show me what's under the
          hood?
          Back at Helen's car. Leslie sneaks over to Annie.

                         ANNIE

          puts his hands on her ass.

          No, it's not. I don't know what happened.

          even talking to me. I think I'm so afraid
          to see what's really happening.
          Lillian's moving on to this great life
          and I feel left behind. And know matter

          life now.

          Annie, Lillian loves you. (beat] I know I
          haven't made things easy for you.. I
          don't have a life and I am bored. Perry
          is always away and I'm constantly alone
          and she's been there. And I've been a
          bridesmaid nine times and although I may
          have implied it, I....I've never been a
          Maid of Honor. I wanted to make
          everything special for Lillian because...
          I don't have a lot of friends. I wanted
          her to like me better and to impress her,
          and everyone else. And I'm just good at
          throwing parties. I always have been. In
          fact sometimes I think people only ask me
          to be in their wedding's because of that.

                         ANNIE
          Lillian wouldn't do that. If she asked
          you to be in her wedding it's because you
          are her friend. Trust me.
          Dana is crying and takes a picture. The're both startled
          by the flash.

          Well, I'm really rich.
          They smile.

          It is getting pretty late.

          What should we do about Lillian?

                         ANNIE
          She'll come home when she's ready.

          INT. ANNIE HALLWAY. LATE THAT NIGHT (EARLY AM]

          Annie enters exhausted to find Lillian sitting against
          her door. Annie walks up and slides down to sit next to
          her. After a minute.

                         ANNIE
          You okay?

                         LILLIAN
          Yeah. Didn't mean to make anyone worry.

                         ANNIE
          It's okay. I really am sorry.

                         LILLIAN
          I'm sorry too. I didnt want things to
          turn out like this. I got so caught up in
          the frenzy of everything, wanting this
          one day to be perfect.

                         ANNIE
          Well its easy to get caught up.

          hate eachother.

                         ANNIE
          I'm sorry. But it's all good now. We all
          talked and everythings cool.

                         HELEN
          Really?!

                         ANNIE
          Yup, Helen and I are best friends now.
          We're going shopping for cream sweaters
          tomorrow.

                         LILLIAN

          I know.

                         LILLIAN
          I just wish the wedding hadnt become
          about everything and everyone else but me
          and Dougie. And now, it's become this
          thing I never wanted. I did want simple.
          I wanted colored lanterns, twinkly lights
          and food everywhere. I wanted a DJ to
          play all those stupid wedding songs.

                         ANNIE
          It's not too late to have those things.

                         LILLIAN
          I'm sorry I didn't know all the stuff you
          were going through too.
          Annie is clearly sad.

                         ANNIE
          It's fine. I just feel really lost right

                         NOW AND--
          Lillian hugs her.

                         LILLIAN
          Nothing's going to change.

                         ANNIE
          You want to come in? Steve's home. This
          could be your last chance as a single
          woman.

          EXT HIGHWAY. VERY EARLY NEXT MORNING
          The small paper bag sits on the side of the road. Cop car
          pulls up. This is Rhodes' spot, we've seen before. He
          gets out and walks over to it, confused. He picks it up
          and it says, âOfficer Rhodesâ. He's a little weary but
          opens it and pulls out a note. âI hear you like
          moonpies.â He looks in the bag and smiles.

          EXT. WEDDING RECEPTION. BELMONT CLUB. DUSK.

          Becca and Kevin are slow dancing happily very much in
          love.
          Leslie and Paul dancing with two boys trying to join in.
          They are all happy, he rubs her stomach.
          Perry and Helen are dancing. They look like they are
          talking and working things out. He hugs her and kisses
          her.
          Lillian and Dougie dance into frame. They are very close.
          Smiling and kissing. They've never looked happier. She
          smiles at someone. It's Annie.
          Annie is watching everyone from the side, smiling also.
          Steve approaches.

                         STEVE
          Thanks a lot for bringing me.

                         ANNIE
          Thanks for coming with me.
          Megan appears on her other side.

                         MEGAN

          Megan winks at Steve, he grabs her hand and they go to
          dance.
          Annie is alone, watching everybody. We see the wedding as
          a whole. It's a beautiful event. Colored lanterns,
          twinkly lights, food everywhere. Simple, fun...very
          Lillian.

          EXT. RECEPTION. LATER

          Annie and Lillian walking out of the reception.

                         LILLIAN
          So when does school start?

                         ANNIE
          A week. I'm scared. I'm gonna be the
          oldest one there.

                         LILLIAN
          So what? Now you can have an affair with
          your teacher and it won't be gross.
          They walk down the steps.

                         LILLIAN (CONT'D)
          Thanks for everything today. Yo've been
          the best Maid of Honor ever.

                         ANNIE
          Really?

                         LILLIAN
          (kidding) MMM. No. That's not true at
          all. You were pretty terrible. Today you
          were good.
          Annie sees the hotel shuttle.

                         ANNIE
          Oh, I want to catch this shuttle back to
          the hotel.

                         LILLIAN
          You're always gonna be my best friend.
          They hug goodbye. She runs down the stairs.

                         ANNIE
          I will see YOU in a couple weeks Mrs.
          Price!

          Lillian waves goodbye and turns to go back inside. Annie
          runs towards the shuttle.
          She's too late. The shuttle drives away without her. She
          JUST missed it.

          ANNIE (CONT'D)
          Wait! Wait! Stop! Great. Of course.
          The shuttle is gone, but there's something that was on
          the other side of it.

          RHODES (O.C.)
          Need a ride ma'am?
          It's Rhodes, leaning against his car like Jake in sixteen
          candles. Annie is all smiles and walks up to him.

                         ANNIE
          How did you know I was here?

                         RHODES
          It was really complicated. I remembered
          the name of this place, I called them up,
          told them I was a cop calling on official
          police business, doing a very big
          investigation and uh, made them tell me
          all the weddings they had planned for the
          next two months with a bride named
          Lillian. [ALT: I'm a cop]
          Annie smiles.

                         ANNIE
          Wow.
          They're looking at each other, not knowing what to do.

          ANNIE (CONT'D)
          So, did you get the moonpies?

                         RHODES
          Yes I did.

                         ANNIE
          Did you like' em?

                         RHODES
          Yeah. No. I couldn't eat them. They were
          completely covered in ants.

                         ANNIE

          You probably should have put it in a
          plastic wrap or maybe a foil or
          something. Tupperware would've worked but
          then I'd have to get it back to you-I'm
          gonna kiss you right now so...
          He walks to her and takes her in his arms. They are about
          to kiss.
          Rhodes stops.

          I didn't want to miss my chance again.

          next to her.

          RHODES (O.C.)
          Need a ride ma'am?
          She turns to see Rhodes driving slowly next to her.

          He opens his hand to reveal the ugly carrot. She smiles.
          He stops the car and unlocks the passenger door. She gets
