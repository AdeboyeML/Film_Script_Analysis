          EXT. DESERT HILLS - DAY

          Open on a GEIGER COUNTER scanning over a rocky terrain.
          A SAND STORM blows over the landscape. We are lost somewhere
          in the middle of the New Mexico desert.
          According to the instrument, the area contains high levels of
          radiation...
          THREE MEN WEARING FULL ANTI-RADIATION SUITS have left their
          jeep behind to collect samples of contaminated rocks.
          Not at all worried or bothered by the dust storm or high
          winds, they walk towards the hills.
          The man holding the counter stops in his tracks -

          mask.
          Suddenly, for no apparent reason, THE GEIGER COUNTER GETS

          LOUDER AS THE NUMBERS SKYROCKET.
          In confusion, he taps on the instrument attempting to
          stabilize it, but the radioactivity continues to climb...
          He looks up to the horizon obscured by the sand storm - still
          nothing in sight.
          He sighs. His colleague is probably right, the Geiger counter
          simply needs an adjustment...
          He turns it off when A MAN COVERED WITH BLOOD, HALF NAKED,

          Scared to death, the scientist pushes him away and backs off.

          On the side of the road, at the bottom of a hill, a gas
          station has survived years of wind and dust.
          Around the main building, a tool shed, three gas pumps, a
          dilapidated well, a water tower, and gutted carcasses of cars
          from the 1950's accentuate the desolate feeling which
          prevails in this place.
          A sign reads "LAST STOP FOR 200 MILES".

          road. The car and trailer approach.
          Off screen, we hear ANIMALISTIC BREATHING behind the
          binoculars.
          The SUV turns off the main road onto a dirt trail. We see
          Brenda lifting the gate and allowing the vehicles to access
          the path, unaware of the danger lurking about.
          Brenda gets back in the SUV. It pulls the trailer on the dirt
          road towards the hills.

          No answer. He knocks on the door.

          It's Bob Carter, I got some gas
          from you a couple of hours ago.
          Still nothing. Big Bob draws his gun and opens the door when-

          SILENCE.
          From the other side of the house, the whistling has stopped.

          Anybody there? Answer me!
          After a few seconds, the whistling returns.

          Holding his gun, Big Bob steps into the empty gas station
          store. A faint light comes from the back room. The wind blows
          dust through the broken windows...
          Vigilantly, he moves through the empty shelves, behind the
          counter and past the beaded curtain separating the two rooms.
          The light bulb above the dining table is on.

          Somebody home? Hello?
          Big Bob pushes the last door leading to the back room.
          His hand feels for the light switch.
          CLICK - an old lamp comes on in the corner.
          He finds a wall mounted phone and picks up the receiver.
          No tone.

          Dammit...
          Through the window, Big Bob sees a pick-up truck.
          He starts searching for the keys.
          Going through the different rooms, he discovers a drawer full
          of money, jewels, watches, credit cards... A REAL FORTUNE.
          He spots a key chain hanging from a nail next to the desk. He
          reaches for the keys when something else grabs his attention-
          Partially hidden in the dark, he discovers a few family
          photos and a few newspaper clippings from the 1950s pinned to
          the wallpaper.
          Big Bob lights the desk lamp and turns it towards the wall-

          THEY ARE ALL AFFECTED BY GENETIC ABNORMALITIES.
          On a more recent polaroid, we can recognize Ruby at 6 years
          old. Besides her three fingers and big eyes, half of her
          skull is missing or caved in.
          Another polaroid - in a wheelchair, a little boy has
          difficulty holding up his hugely disproportionate head.
          The headline from the clippings makes Big Bob understand the
          origins of these horrors-
          "New Mexico- Nuclear enters a new age."
          ".. .Miner town evacuated"
          "Miners refuse to abandon their lands by hiding in

          "Military destroys miner's town."
          The old man's family was. one of those families whose genetic
          lineage was forever changed by the nuclear fallout.
          Big Bob is shocked, never believing such a thing was
          possible.

          The flames climb into the air lighting the surrounding rocky
          desert.
          SOMEONE SCREAMS. Doug and Bobby turn around.

          He has been crucified to a Joshua tree and transformed into a

          The explosion and the screaming has awakened Ethel who comes
          out of the trailer in her nightgown. Recognizing his screams,

          Doug runs into the trailer grabbing a fire extinguisher and
          some blankets. In the panic, he fails to see Brenda
          restrained by Pluto.

          Doug runs out leaving the door wide open.
          Someone jumps from the roof and, on all fours, lands in front
          of the door. He stands and, for the first time, we see the
          face of -
          LIZARD - Pluto's cousin.
          Lizard is as thin as Pluto is imposing. Extremely pale, his
          face is disfigured by A CLEFT LIP WHICH EXPOSES HIS DEFORMED

          JAW. A SAVAGE WITH NO SENSE OF PITY, LIZARD IS, AFTER PAPA

          Lizard has Big Bob's Magnum. He enters the trailer and closes
          the door behind him.

          71 EXT. DESERT - NIGHT 71

          Big Bob screams as the flames devour his naked flesh.
          His fingers tighten. His bloodied face distorts with pain.
          Even his eyes are burnt. Considering the condition of his
          body, it's a miracle he's still alive...
          Doug arrives with the extinguisher and begins putting out the

          and places her flowery sun hat on his head. This disturbed
          mind takes pleasure in dressing up in "Mama's clothes"...
          Then, famished, he eats everything he can find in the
          trailer.
          Raw meat, fruit, potato chips... He washes it all down with
          milk, orange juice...
          His eyes stop on the bird cage. He smiles.
          Lizard moves closer, opens the cage and grabs one of the
          parrakeets.
          The small bird looks around in confusion.

          Blood drips on his chin.
          Brenda's muted screams attract his attention.
          Lizard walks across the trailer. HE WANTS HIS SHARE.
          He pushes Pluto violently to the ground.

          Behind them, terrified, Brenda watches helplessly as they
          fight.
          Lizard puts his foot on Pluto's face, pinning him to the
          ground, and then points the gun to his head.

          Doug hides behind a rock. Sweating, he catches his breath.

          90 INT. MINE - DAY 90

          With the light from the entrance behind him, shadow enters
          the mine.
          The beam from his flashlight follows the trail of blood on
          the ground.
          The wooden pylons which have held up the walls for a hundred
          years threaten to crumble at any second.
          Only static on the radio. Doug turns it off.
          He moves further into the darkness, probing with his
          flashlight into the inky pit.
          Doug arrives at a fork splitting the tunnel off in two
          different directions.
          Doug lights each tunnel with the flashlight until he finds
          the one with-the blood trail, then continues on into that
          one. Tracking.
          Suddenly he stops.
          The beam of the flashlight has revealed TWO DOZEN PICKAXES
          that have been planted in the ground over mounds. That look
          very much like graves. The pickaxes look eerily like crosses,
          given the whole place the feel of A SUBTERRANEAN GRAVEYARD.
          Hanging from the graves, dates and portraits of all the
          miners who have died here, including women and children...
          The flashlight dims. Doug taps it to no avail.

           Then light goes. completely off, leaving Doug in darkness.
          Scratch! - He lights a match.
          Holding the tiny flame, Doug continues down the tunnel until
          he arrives at another fork. He can no longer see the blood
          trail.

          He turns around, looking for the source of the air, and

           Brenda drags one of the tires from the SUV 30 feet away.
           She douses it with lighter fluid and-
          Whoosh! - a match sets it on fire creating a thick, black,
          smoke signal.
          Brenda joins her brother who is busy planting wooden stakes
          in a circle fifty meters around the trailer.

          around each stake. He sets the fishing pole next to the

          the mouth of the mine, someone observes between the rocks-
          it's Ruby.
          Doug slows his pace as he enters Main Street. The town is
          deserted. No sign of life anywhere. All the houses and cars
          are covered with a thick layer of dust.
          Taking a closer look, he realizes all the parked cars are
          from the 50's.
          Uncertain, Doug walks through the ghost town, with Beast at
          his side...
          No movement besides the wind blowing and lifting an
          occasional cloud of dust. Doug walks up to a house and knocks
          on the front door.
          No one to open the door. Doug wipes one of the windows-
          It's too dark inside to see anything. The door is unlocked,
          Doug pushes it.
          It squeaks open. He hesitates before entering.

          Sunlight passes through the dusty windows revealing a
          living/dining room decorated from the 50's.
          Doug can't believe his eyes-
          Through the kitchen door, he can see a woman doing dishes.
          A man sits in the living room reading a newspaper.
          Children play in front of the blank TV set...

          They have been dressed and placed into real life situations.

          Doug spots a telephone behind the staircase and checks for a
          dial tone.
          Nothing. He picks up the phone casing.

          Stupefied, Doug enters yet another house.
          The door remains open as we see another family of dummies
          living a perfect little life. A LIFE WHICH STOPPED IN THE

          LATE 50'S...
          Around the corner of a house, a little girl dummy is sitting
          on a swing, her face half broken.
          A second later, Doug thinks he hears CHILDREN LAUGHING. He

                         TURNS AROUND-
          Nothing but the wind blowing through the houses.
          Doug takes Catherine's bib from his pocket and lets Beast get
          its scent.

                         DOUG
          Find her, Beast, find Catherine...
          With his nose to the ground, the dog pulls Doug straight
          ahead.
          Doug walks away through the streets, pulled by the dog.
          On the outskirts of town, we discover a fence buried in the
          sand. On it, an old metallic sign reads-

          TEST SITE 3B - MILITARY ZONE - HIGH RADIATION RISK
          The scent leads Doug into an alley off the main street.
          He sees an old generator on full throttle. A thick smoke
          pours from the exhaust.

          filth. He decides to go around when-

          A MAN WALKS INTO VIEW WITHOUT SEEING HIM!
          Immediately, Doug backs away.
          The man drags a cadaver by its feet. Half of the dead body
          is missing, having apparently been torn off.
          Beast GROWLS.
          The man turns around, revealing his horrible face-
          A METALLIC BRACE is screwed on four sides of his head helping
          him stand straight. ENORMOUS CYSTS DISFIGURE HIM AND COVER
          EVERY VISIBLE PART OF HIS BODY. Let's call him "CYST".
          Cyst traces back his steps, trying to find what caused the
          noise. He holds the gas station attendant's shotgun!
          The alley is empty. The generators are still motoring.
          All seems normal. Cyst turns back towards main street.
          Cyst passes an old'parked car without seeing Doug and the dog
          hidden inside.
          Doug breathes a sigh of relief. Close call.
          Quietly, Doug gets out of the car. He hesitates as to whether
          he should bring Beast with him or to leave him in the car.
          The dog could be his best weapon but, on the other hand, he
          also represents a_bigger risk to be spotted.

          BIG BOB'S CHARRED BODY!
          His father-in-law's arms have been torn off and devoured. THE
          AMERICAN FLAG that used to adorn his SUV is planted THROUGH

          HIS FOREHEAD!
          Doug approaches terrified.

          BEHIND HIM A WEAK AND ASTHMATIC VOICE BEGINS TO SING THE

                         NATIONAL ANTHEM-

          VOICE (O.S.)
          "Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's
          early light,
          What so proudly we hailed at the
          twilight's last gleaming?"
          Doug jumps and quickly lifts the baseball bat, ready to
          swing.
          Nobody. Just the fake living room filled with inert dummies.
          No trace of his baby. An electrical fan turns in a corner,
          close to a shelve full of old books...
          Doug moves forward, gripping the bat tightly.

          He can hear his own heart beat as he searches through the
          house. In another room, close to the window and in the
          shadows, he sees someone sitting in a wheelchair.

          Doug gets closer-
          A ray of light shines on the skull of whoever sits in the
          wheel chair.
          The wheel chair moves forward revealing a most horrific sight-
          BIG BRAIN - We recognize the handicapped man whom we have
          seen before, bathing behind the screen. Big Brain's body is
          skeletal. He was born with a genetic disease giving him a
          head ten times bigger than his face. A head so heavy, he is
          unable to hold it up. It rests back on his chair, forcing him
          to stretch his eyes to see from side to side.
          Big Brain is maybe the most representative character of the
          damage done by nuclear fallout in this area.
          Doug threatens him with the baseball bat-

          CRASH - PLUTO, THE DEFORMED BALD GIANT, PULVERIZES THE DOOR

          WITH AN AXE AND SMASHES INTO THE HOUSE!
          Like a wild animal, Pluto charges Doug, destroying everything
          in his path.
          Doug retreats in the living room, throwing the dummies at his
          assailant.
          The giant comes closer and closer.
          Dummies are chopped into pieces.
          Doug dodges away and tries to escape, using the stairs in the
          hallway but the giant grabs him by the feet and pulls him
          down...
          The axe swings through the air missing him by a hair each

          Doug runs into another room, escaping from Pluto and his axe.
          Instinctively, he uses the first piece of furniture he can
          find, A CHEST, to block the door behind him. He looks
          desperately for an exit. No way out.
          The axe penetrates through the door. The chest won't be
          enough to hold back Pluto.
          Second axe blow- This time the axe tears up the boards of the
          door, allowing Pluto to stick his gruesome face inside.
          Seeing Doug trapped in the room, the bald giant begins to
          laugh stupidly before turning around and walking away.

          CRASH! - PLUTO EXPLODES THROUGH THE WALL, LANDING ON TOP OF

          DOUG!
          Doug loses his bat but slides away before the axe comes
          swinging down.
          Desperate, he picks up the bat and uses it as a shield. The
          axe splits it in half.
          Doug throws himself at Pluto plunging the splintered bat into
          his abdomen.
          The sharp piece of wood enters Pluto's stomach.
          Completely out of his mind, Pluto removes the piece of wood
          from his abdomen and beats Doug in the face with it, sending
          him across the room.
          Pluto lowers his head, charging Doug like a bull. Doug
          crashes into one of the walls.
          He can't even take a breath before the giant grabs him by the
          leg like a rag doll and throws him through a wall.
          Doug falls to the ground in the living room. Wounded and
          exhausted, he is also defenseless. He has lost his glasses.
          Not far away, Big Brain savors the spectacle.
          The giant walks to him spinning the axe in his hand like a
          baton.
          His foot crushes Doug's glasses on the floor.
          The axe swings through the air. Doug jumps out of the way.

          Pluto slowly caresses the axe's blade on his victims throat
          and face.
          The sharp blade moves dangerously across Doug's skin. Pluto
          stops when he sees Doug holding his PHILLIPS SCREWDRIVER!
          Pluto laughs like a dumb child at the feeble weapon. Behind
          him, Big Brain joins in on the laughter-
          Disfigured by his wounds, Doug is frozen with the screwdriver
          pointed at the giant. He looks ridiculous and starts sobbing

          floor. Pluto screams in pain.
