      EXT. MARIGOLD PATH - DUSK

      A path of marigold petals leads up to an altar lovingly
      arranged in a humble cemetery. An old woman lights a candle
      as the smoke of burning copal wood dances lyrically upward...

      PAPEL PICADO CARD: "COCO"

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  Sometimes I think I'm cursed...
                  'cause of something that happened
                  before I was even born.

      A story begins to play out on the papel picado.

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  See, a long time ago there was this
                  family.

      The images on the papel picado come to life to illustrate a
      father, a mother, and a little girl. The family is happy.

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  The papá, he was a musician.

      The papá plays guitar while the mother dances with her
      daughter.

                             MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  He and his family would sing, and
                  dance, and count their blessings...
                      (beat)
                  But he also had a dream... to play
                  for the world.
                      (beat)
                  And one day he left with his
                  guitar... and never returned.

      The man walks down a road, guitar slung on his back. In
      another vignette his daughter stands in the doorway, watching
      her papá leave. Two feet step up next to her. It is her
      mamá, hardened.

      She shuts the door.

                             MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  And the mamá...? She didn't have
                  time to cry over that walkaway
                  musician!
                      (beat)
                  After banishing all music from her
                  life...

      The woman gets rid of all of her husband's instruments and
      records.

                             MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  She found a way to provide for her
                  daughter...
                      (beat)
                  She rolled up her sleeves and she
                  learned to make shoes.
                      (beat)
                  She could have made candy!

      Amongst the papel picado, a stick swings at a strung up
      piñata which bursts with candy...

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  Or fireworks!

      Fireworks go off in the background...

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  Or sparkly underwear for wrestlers!

      Sparkly underwear and a luchador mask hang on a line amongst
      other linens...

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  But no... she chose shoes...

      On the papel picado, the little girl becomes a young woman.

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  Then she taught her daughter to
                  make shoes. And later, she taught
                  her son-in-law.

      She introduces a suitor to the family business.

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  Then her grandkids got roped in.
                  As her family grew, so did the
                  business.

      In the next vignette, a bunch of goofy grandchildren join in
      the shoemaking. The shoe shop is full of family!

                             MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  Music had torn her family apart,
                  but shoes held them all together.
                      (beat)
                  You see, that woman was my great-
                  great grandmother, Mamá Imelda.

      OFRENDA ROOM - DAY

      where a photo sits at the top of a beautiful altar. The
      photo features MAMÁ IMELDA -- serious, formidable. She holds
      a baby on her lap. Her husband stands beside her, but his
      face has been torn away.

                             MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  She died WAY before I was born.
                  But my family still tells her story
                  every year on Día de los Muertos --
                  the Day of the Dead...
                      (beat)
                  And her little girl?

      Fade from the face of the little girl to present day MAMÁ

      wheelchair.

                  She's my great grandmother, Mamá
                  Coco.

      A boy (12) walks into frame and kisses her on the cheek.
      This is our narrator, MIGUEL.

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  Actually, my name is Miguel. Mamá
                  Coco has trouble remembering
                  things... But it's good to talk to
                  her anyway. So I tell her pretty
                  much everything.

      Miguel's ABUELITA (70s) runs the table like a ship captain.
      She gives Mamá Coco a kiss on the head.

      INT. RIVERA WORKSHOP - DAY

      We see the Rivera family tinkering in the shoe shop, no music
      to be heard. Miguel jogs past them.

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  And my family's fine with that...

                  Hola!

      He passes a band of musicians playing a tune. Miguel joins
      with some air guitar and the further down the street he goes,
      the more instruments and sounds layer in. The bells of the
      church chime in harmony, a radio blares a cumbia rhythm.





                                                                      7.


      Running past a food stand, Miguel grabs a roll of pan dulce
      and tosses the vendor a coin.

      As Miguel passes all these scenes, the music synthesizes and
      he can't help but tap out rhythms along a table of alebrijes.
      The fantastical wooden animal sculptures each play a
      different tone like a marimba. Miguel finishes with a SMACK
      on a trash can, out of which a pops up a scrappy hairless
      Xolo dog. The dog, DANTE, barks and jumps up to lick Miguel,
      who laughs.

      ground before he goes. Abuelita hugs Miguel protectively to
      her bosom.

      Mamá Coco looks up at Abuelita.

                  Who are you?

      Sadness rises in Abuelita; she swallows it down.

                            ABUELITA
                  Rest, Mamá.

      Abuelita returns to the ofrenda.

      Abuelita steps up to the ofrenda.

      brighten with an idea.

      EXT. SIDE STREET

      Tío Berto unloads rolls of leather from a truckbed. Nearby,
      Dante sleeps under the shade of a tree. He startles awake by
      a faint TWANGING. The dog scrambles up to the roof.

      He reaches a shoe sign advertising the Rivera Family business
      and lifts it up.


      INT. ROOFTOP HIDEOUT

      Dante pokes his head in.      Miguel turns and gasps.





                                                                    18.


                            MIGUEL
                  Oh, it's you. Get in here, c'mon,
                  Dante. Hurry up.

      Dante wriggles into the hideout. Miguel is huddled over
      something. The dog peeks around his shoulder.

                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)
                  You're gonna get me in trouble,
                  boy. Someone could hear me!

      Miguel reveals a makeshift guitar, cobbled together from a
      beat up old soundboard and random other items.

      He takes a china marker and sketches a nose on what appears
      to be his own version of a skull guitar head.

                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)
                  I wish someone wanted to hear me...

      Miguel tunes the guitar.

                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)
                  Other than you...

      Dante gives Miguel a big sloppy lick. Miguel gives a grossed-
      out chuckle. He lifts his guitar and strums.

                              MIGUEL (CONT'D)
                  Perfecto!

      He crawls to the far side of the attic where he's built his
      own ofrenda to Ernesto de la Cruz. Posters, candles, and
      songbooks are arranged with care. Miguel lights the candles
      with reverence, illuminating an album cover of de la Cruz
      holding his skull guitar.

      Miguel compares the head of his guitar to the album cover.
      Then he imitates de la Cruz's pose and smile.

      He switches on a beat up old TV and pushes a tape into the
      VCR, "Best of de la Cruz" scrawled on the spine.

      A montage of the greatest moments from de la Cruz's films
      plays out.

      A clip from "A QUIEN YO AMO:"

                            DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
                  I have to sing. I have to play.
                  The music, it's -- it's not just in
                  me. It is me.





                                                                     19.


      Miguel strums his guitar as de la Cruz imparts his wisdom.
      More clips run in the background as Miguel plays:

                            DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
                  When life gets me down, I play my
                  guitar.

      In a clip from "A QUIEN YO AMO:"

                            DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
                  The rest of the world may follow
                  the rules, but I must follow my
                  heart!

      De la Cruz kisses a woman passionately.      Miguel cringes.

      Another clip from "A QUIEN YO AMO:"

                            DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
                  You know that feeling? Like
                  there's a song in the air and it's
                  playing just for you...

      As Miguel watches de la Cruz play guitar in the video, he
      repeats the melody on his own guitar.

                  WANT SOMETHING SO MUCH
                  BUT IT'S TRUE...

      As a good-natured priest in "NUESTRA IGLESIA:"

                            DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
                  You must have faith, sister.

                  ONLY A SONG

      Miguel loses himself in the music.





                                                                         20.

                  music...

      Miguel's tune intertwines with the melodies on the TV set.
      The clip jumps forward:

                            LOLA (FILM CLIP)
                  But my father, he will never give
                  his permission.

                            DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
                  I am done asking permission. When
                  you see your moment you mustn't let
                  it pass you by, you must seize it!

      The tape ends with an interview clip.

                            INTERVIEWER (FILM CLIP)
                  Señor de la Cruz, what did it take

                  I had to have faith in my dream.
                  No one was going to hand it to me.
                  It was up to me to reach for that
                  dream, grab it tight, and make it
                  come true.

                            MIGUEL
                  ...and make it come true.

      The tape ends. The words sink into Miguel.        He reaches for
      the flyer for the plaza "TALENT SHOW."

                            MIGUEL
                  No more hiding, Dante.      I gotta
                  seize my moment!

      Dante wags his tail, panting happily.

      EXT. RIVERA COMPOUND - SUNSET

      Children run by with sparklers as Abuelita opens the doors to
      the family compound.





                                                                      21.


                            ABUELITA
                  Día de los Muertos has begun!

      In the courtyard, two TODDLER COUSINS haphazardly scatter
      marigold petals from their baskets.

                            MAMÁ
                  No, no, no, no, no.

      Mamá corrects them, creating a path from the ofrenda room to
      the front gate.

                            MAMÁ (CONT'D)
                  We have to make a clear path. The
                  petals guide our ancestors home. We
                  don't want their spirits to get
                  lost. We want them to come, and
                  enjoy all the food and drinks on
                  the ofrenda, sí?

      As Mamá teaches, Miguel and Dante sneak across the roof and
      drop to the sidewalk outside the compound, Miguel clutching
      his guitar.

      Suddenly Tío Berto and Papá round the corner carrying a small
      table from storage.

                            PAPÁ
                  Mamá, where should we put this
                  table?

      Miguel and Dante back up to avoid the adults, only to find
      Abuelita sweeping the sidewalk behind them! Miguel and Dante
      jump into the back into the Rivera courtyard before she sees
      them.

                            ABUELITA
                  In the courtyard, mijos.

                            PAPÁ
                  You want it down by the kitchen?

                             ABUELITA
                  Sí.   Next to the other one.


      INT. OFRENDA ROOM

      Miguel backs out of the courtyard and into the family ofrenda
      room. Nearly cornered, he ushers Dante past a sleeping Mamá
      Coco. He stashes the dog and the guitar under the ofrenda
      table.





                                                                         22.

      Miguel straightens up to notice the doorway of the ofrenda
      room darkened by three figures.

                  Nothing!

      His Abuelita and parents stare straight at him.     A pit grows
      in his stomach; he's been caught.

                  Mamá -- Papá, I--

      Abuelita hands Papá a leather apron, which he hangs over
      Miguel's shoulders.

                  What?!

                  be making them! Every day after
                  school!

      Abuelita shuffles toward Miguel squealing.      She squeezes his
      cheeks, full of pride.

                            ABUELITA

                  ...A shoemaker. Through and
                  through.

      Papá swells.

                            PAPÁ
                  That's my boy!
                      (calling out)
                  Berto, break out the good stuff, I
                  wanna make a toast!

      Papá heads out of the room, Mamá follows. Last is Abuelita,
      who smothers Miguel with tons of kisses as she leaves.

      With the family gone, Miguel deflates.

      Suddenly, a noise comes from the ofrenda. Miguel turns to
      find Dante on the bottom tier, licking a plate of mole to his
      heart's content. Miguel is horrified!

                             MIGUEL
                  Dante!   No, Dante, stop!

      Miguel pulls the dog away from the ofrenda, but the table
      shakes. The frame with Mamá Imelda's photo sways back and
      forth, then topples to the ground with a sickening crack.

                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)
                  No, no, no, no, no! No...

      Miguel picks up the old photo of Mamá Imelda, which unfolds
      to reveal another portion, hidden all these years;

      the man with no face is revealed to be holding a familiar
      skull-headed guitar.

                  Papá?

      Miguel turns, startled. Mamá Coco points a crooked finger at
      the picture in his hand.

                              MAMÁ COCO (CONT'D)
                  Papá?

      Miguel's eyes go wide as the connection dawns on him.   Could
      it possibly be true?

      Miguel goes to his secret ofrenda, to the record album of
      Ernesto de la Cruz. He compares the guitar in the family
      photo with the guitar on the sleeve. An exact match!

                              MIGUEL
                  Ha, ha!

      Miguel runs to the edge of the roof, overlooking the
      courtyard, photo in one hand, guitar in the other.

      Miguel whips off his shoemaker's apron, striking a pose with
      the guitar.

      Miguel lifts his guitar to play when Abuelita snatches the
      instrument away. She points to the man in the photo.

      Gasps from the family.      Abuelita's brow hardens.   She lifts
      the guitar in the air.

      EXT. SIDE STREET

      Miguel bursts out of the compound, desperate to get away.
      Dante, nose buried in a trash bag, hears Miguel and chases
      after him. Miguel runs past a poster for the plaza "TALENT

      Miguel approaches a STAGE MANAGER in the gazebo.

      Disheartened, Miguel walks away.       He finds himself facing the
      statue of de la Cruz.

                  Great-great grandfather... What am
                  I supposed to do?

      No answer. Miguel's gaze falls on a plaque at the base of
      the statue that reads "Seize Your Moment!" Miguel looks at
      the photo in his hand. He moves his thumb to reveal the
      skull head guitar. Then, a firework illuminates the skull
      head guitar that the statue holds. Miguel gets an idea.


      EXT. CEMETERY - MOMENTS LATER

      A sea of candles and flowers, families gathered at graves.

      Miguel sneaks through the cemetery unnoticed, slipping from
      one shadow to the next.

      Dante suddenly catches up to Miguel.         He barks excitedly.

                            MIGUEL
                  No, no, no, no, no, Dante stop!
                  Cállate! Shhh!

      Miguel swipes a chicken leg off a neighboring grave, and
      chucks it. Dante bounds after the food.

      EXT. DE LA CRUZ'S MAUSOLEUM

      Miguel slinks around the side of the tomb.   He looks in one
      of the windows.

      Inside, the famous guitar hangs above the crypt. Fireworks
      pop; bursts of light glint off the instrument. It seems to
      beckon him. He tries the window but it's locked.

      More fireworks shoot into the sky.

                            MIGUEL
                  I'm sorry...

      Timing to the explosions, Miguel throws his shoulder into the
      rusted-shut window pane and forces it open with a scraping
      KRRRR-LANK! He slinks inside the tomb.


      INT. DE LA CRUZ'S MAUSOLEUM

      Miguel drops down to the mausoleum floor. The noise from
      outside is muffled. He climbs onto the crypt, slightly
      moving the lid. He stifles a gasp.

      He crawls over the marble sarcophagus and comes face-to-face
      with the famed guitar. Miguel wipes away a layer of dust,
      revealing the rich painted wood beneath. He looks up to the
      portrait of de la Cruz.

                            MIGUEL
                  Señor de la Cruz? Please don't be
                  mad. I'm Miguel, your great-great
                  grandson... I need to borrow this.

      Heart in his throat, Miguel lifts the guitar off its mount.
      Unbeknownst to him, some marigold petals in the mausoleum
      begin to sparkle.

                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)
                  Our family thinks music is a curse.
                  None of them understand, but I know
                  you would have. You would've told
                  me to follow my heart. To seize my
                  moment!

      He backs up, in full view of the painting.

                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)
                  So if it's all right with you, I'm

      Confidence building, he strums it once.

      The air around him vibrates -- radiating like a shock wave.
      The petals on the ground whirl and surge with light for just
      a moment. Miguel is visibly taken aback. What just
      happened?

      Suddenly, a flashlight shines in the window of the mausoleum.

                            VOICES (O.S.)
                  The guitar! It's gone! Somebody
                  stole de la Cruz's guitar! The
                  window's broken, look.

      Miguel hears keys jangling and the door unlocking.   A
      GROUNDSKEEPER enters with a flashlight.

                            GROUNDSKEEPER
                  Alright, who's in there?

      Startled, Miguel puts down the guitar.

                  I... I'm sorry! It's not what it

      The groundskeeper walks straight through Miguel!   He doesn't
      even see him!

      EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

      A panicked Miguel runs out, trying to figure out what's going
      on! But the people in the cemetery walk through him too.

      Suddenly he hears a familiar voice.

                              MAMÁ

      Miguel turns to see Papá and Mamá still searching for him.

      Frantic, Miguel trips and falls into an open grave.      A nearby
      woman gasps and peeks over the ledge of the grave.

                              WOMAN
                  Dios mío!    Little boy, are you
                  okay?

      She reaches into the grave.

                            WOMAN (CONT'D)
                  Here, let me help you.

      Miguel takes her hand and she pulls him out.

                            MIGUEL
                  Thanks, I--

      They see each other face to face.       The woman is a skeleton!
      Miguel screams! She does too!

      Miguel backs away. He turns to see another skeleton. He
      falls backwards and scoots away frantically. He bumps into
      another skeleton whose head falls off and lands in Miguel's
      hands.

                            SKELETON HEAD
                  Do you mind?

                              MIGUEL
                  Ahhh!

                              SKELETON HEAD
                  Ahhh!

                              MIGUEL
                  AHHH!

      Miguel tosses the head away from him and turns to see the
      whole cemetery is teeming with skeletons! And they can all
      see him!

      He races off and hides behind a grave. After a moment, he
      peeks over the headstone to watch the skeletons engaging with
      their living families.

      One couple dances.

      Another man reaches for offerings on his grave, which
      solidify in his hands when he takes them.





                                                                    32.


      A couple of skeletons coo over a toddler.

                            SKELETON ABUELA
                  Look how big she's getting!

      Suddenly Dante surprises Miguel and licks him on the cheek.
      Miguel screams.

                            MIGUEL
                  Dante?! You can see me?          W-wait!
                  What's going on?!

      Dante barks, points, and bounds through the crowd.

                              MIGUEL
                  Dante!    Dante!

      Miguel gives chase until -­ BAM! He runs smack into a
      mustached skeleton and falls to the ground. The skeleton's
      bones break apart and scatter. The head pops up.

                            MIGUEL
                  I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

                              PAPÁ JULIO
                  Miguel?!

      Miguel tries to gather the scattered bones.

                              TÍA ROSITA
                  Miguel?

                              TÍA VICTORIA
                  Miguel?

      The bones magically pull away from Miguel.

                            PAPÁ JULIO
                  You're here! HERE here!

      PAPÁ JULIO reconstitutes himself.

                            PAPÁ JULIO (CONT'D)
                  And you can see us?!

      TÍA ROSITA charges through Papá Julio, sending his bones
      scattering again. She grabs Miguel, hugging him tight.

                            TÍA ROSITA
                  Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-ti-to!

      Miguel, smothered by Rosita's ample ribcage, struggles for
      air.




                                                                      33.


                            MIGUEL
                      (muffled)
                  Remind me how I know you?

                            TÍA ROSITA
                  We're your family, mijo!

      Tía Rosita's ofrenda photo flashes in Miguel's memory.

                            MIGUEL
                  Tía... Rosita?

                               TÍA ROSITA
                  Sí!

      He looks at Papá Julio, whose head is still turned the wrong
      way. TÍA VICTORIA straightens it.

                            MIGUEL
                  Papá Julio?

                               PAPÁ JULIO
                  Hola.

                            MIGUEL
                  Tía Victoria?

      Tía Victoria pokes Miguel's cheek, skeptical.

                            TÍA VICTORIA
                  He doesn't seem entirely dead.

      A living person ambles through Miguel's non-corporeal form.

                            TÍA ROSITA
                  He's not quite alive either...

                            PAPÁ JULIO
                  We need Mamá Imelda. She'll know
                  how to fix this!

      Suddenly twin skeleton gents run, huffing, toward the family.

                               TÍO FELIPE
                         (huffing)

                            TÍO FELIPE
                      (huffing)
                  --She couldn't cross over!

      The others gasp.

                            TÍO OSCAR
                  She's stuck--

                            TÍO FELIPE
                  --On the other side!

      Miguel sees pictures of his Tío Oscar and Tío Felipe flash in
      his memory.

                               MIGUEL
                  Tío Oscar?     Tío Felipe?

                            TÍO OSCAR
                  Oh, hey Miguel.

      Tía Victoria turns her gaze on Miguel.

                            TÍA VICTORIA
                  I have a feeling this has something
                  to do with you.

                            TÍA ROSITA
                  But if Mamá Imelda can't come to
                  us...

                            PAPÁ JULIO
                  ...Then we are going to her!
                  Vámonos!

      Papá Julio grabs Miguel by the arm and the family rushes
      through the cemetery, trailed by Dante.


      EXT. CEMETERY - MOMENTS LATER

      Miguel and his family weave through the graves, rounding a
      corner.

      His gaze falls upon a glowing MARIGOLD BRIDGE arching before
      them.

                               MIGUEL
                  Whoa...

      The bridge extends into the mist.        A stream of skeletons
      amble across for the holiday.





                                                                      35.


      The family passes through an invisible barrier onto the
      bridge. Their bodies change from ghostly to solid. Miguel
      hesitates at the threshold.

                            PAPÁ JULIO
                  Come on, Miguel. It's ok.

      Miguel follows after the family, the petals glowing under his
      feet. Dante takes off.

                             MIGUEL
                  Dante!   Dante! Dante, wait up!

      Miguel runs after Dante, finally catching up to the dog as he
      rolls in the petals at the crest of the bridge. He sneezes
      some petals into Miguel's face.

                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)
                  You gotta stay with me, boy.       We
                  don't know... where...

      Out of the mist, the sparkling cityscape of the Land of the
      Dead emerges. It's breathtaking. His family sidles up.

                            MIGUEL
                  This isn't a dream, then.        You're
                  all really out there...

                            TÍA VICTORIA
                  You thought we weren't?

                            MIGUEL
                  Well I don't know, I thought it
                  might've been one of those made up
                  things that adults tell kids...
                  like... vitamins.

                            TÍA VICTORIA
                  Miguel, vitamins are a real thing.

                            MIGUEL
                  Well, now I'm thinking maybe they
                  could be...

      As skeletons pass in the other direction, Miguel receives
      some strange looks. A little skeleton girl gasps, pointing
      at him.

                            SKELETON MOTHER
                  Mija, it's not nice to stare at--
                      (seeing Miguel)
                  Ay! Santa Maria!

      The woman goes wide-eyed, her head turning backwards to gawk
      at Miguel as she walks in the opposite direction. Miguel
      puts up his hood.

      The Riveras continue on toward an arrivals area on the far
      side of the bridge. Miguel sees fantastical creatures
      crawling, flying, making nests in the nearby architecture.

                            MIGUEL
                  Are those...? Alebrijes!         But
                  those are--

                            TÍO OSCAR
                  REAL alebrijes. Spirit
                  creatures...

                             TÍA ROSITA
                  They guide souls on their
                  journey...

                            TÍO FELIPE
                  Watch your step, they make caquitas
                  everywhere.

      They get to the far edge of the Marigold Bridge.

      The monitor scans him, but an "X" appears, accompanied by a
      negative buzzing sound.

      Héctor bolts for the bridge. A security guards blocks the
      gate. Héctor splits in two and slides past the guard, half
      going over, half under.

      Héctor reaches the bridge at a sprint, but the magic doesn't
      engage; he sinks right into the petals.

      Miguel watches as the guards haul him out.      Tía Rosita looks
      up in time to see his back.

                  Oh!   Come mijo, it's our turn.

      The arrivals line moves forward. The Dead Riveras crowd
      around the gate. The arrivals agent leans out from his
      window.

                            ARRIVALS AGENT

                  As a matter of fact, yes.

      The family pushes Miguel to the front, very much alive.

      Miguel and his family are escorted by a security guard across

      Dante happily trots alongside.       Miguel looks up to see
      gondolas traveling by.

      Skeletons stare at Miguel as he walks by. Suddenly Miguel
      notices Tío Oscar staring at his face in deep contemplation.

                  I miss my nose...

      At the end of the walkway are doors emblazoned with

      Mamá Imelda coldly eyes the Macintosh 128k on the woman's
      desk.

                  My family always -- ALWAYS -- puts

                  devil box tells you nothing but
                  lies!

      In a swift movement, Mamá Imelda removes her shoe and smacks
      the computer.

                  Mamá Imelda?

      She turns her shoe on Papá Julio, who leans back and yelps.
      Mamá Imelda softens.

      Dante balances his paws at the edge of the clerk's desk and

      of petals and disappears.

      He reappears in a whirlwind of petals. It seems like he's

      face, he turns and eyes de la Cruz's guitar.

      Miguel quickly grabs the guitar.

      Miguel appears back in the clerk's office in another flash of
      the marigold whirlwind, without the guitar. The family
      turns, shocked to see him back so soon.

      Miguel realizes his hands are still in guitar-holding
      position.

      Papá Julio shakes his head and pulls his hat down.

      They all shake their heads.

                            MAMÁ IMELDA
                  Don't make this hard, mijo.      You go
                  home my way, or no way.

                  I will not let you go down the same
                  path he did.

      Miguel gets an idea.     He pulls the photo out and turns from
      the group.

                            MIGUEL
                  The same path he did.

      Miguel sees himself out.      The family waits for a beat.

                  restrooms in the Land of the Dead?


      INT. STAIRCASE - MOMENTS LATER

      Miguel hustles down a staircase with Dante. Once on the
      ground floor, they huddle beneath the staircase. He looks to
      the upper floor. The Dead Riveras are there. Tío Oscar asks
      a PATROLWOMAN about a boy of Miguel's height. The
      patrolwoman picks up her walkie-talkie.

      Miguel scopes the ground floor and spies a revolving door
      exit.

                              MIGUEL
                  Vámonos.

      Miguel puts up his hood, tightening it to a tiny eye hole,
      and heads out. Dante pads after him.

                            PATROLWOMAN
                  We got a family looking for a
                  LIVING BOY.

                            MIGUEL
                  If I wanna be a musician, I need a
                  MUSICIAN'S blessing. We gotta find
                  my great-great grandpa.

      The exit gets closer when Miguel is stopped by a PATROLMAN.

                            PATROLMAN
                  Hold it, muchacho.

      Miguel's hoodie loosens to reveal his living face.

                              PATROLMAN
                  Ahh!

      The patrolman frantically grabs for his walkie-talkie.

                            PATROLMAN
                  I've found that living boy!

      A large family passes between Miguel and the officer, chatty,
      arms full of offerings.

                            PATROLMAN
                  Uh whoa, excuse me, excuse me
                  folks! Excuse me--

      Once the family clears, Miguel is nowhere to be seen.

      nearby cubicle.

      Héctor spies a de la Cruz poster at the officer's

      EXT. MARIGOLD GRAND CENTRAL STATION

      Miguel and Dante burst out the door and rush down the stairs.
      Héctor's arm snaps to get Miguel's attention. Miguel
      realizes it's no longer attached to Héctor's body. The arm
      signals backwards to Héctor who is ten paces behind.

      Miguel throws the arm back to Héctor an they disappear into a
      dense crowd.

      Moments later, the Dead Riveras burst from the revolving
      doors. Mamá Imelda scours the crowd for Miguel. He's
      nowhere to be found.

      Papá Julio steps forward with a marigold petal.      He creeps
      forward, jittery, holding it out for Pepita.

      takes to the air.

      Miguel sits on a wooden crate. Héctor uses his thumb to
      smudge black and white shoe polish on the boy's face.

                  me, I'll find him myself.

      Miguel marches out of the alley, whistling for Dante to
      follow.

      Miguel slink-walks next to Héctor goofily.

                  I'm walking like a skeleton.

      Miguel notices a billboard advertising "ERNESTO DE LA CRUZ'S

      speakers.

      Héctor uses his suspenders to slingshot his arm to a third
      floor window. The hand taps on it.


      INT. COSTUME ROOM

      CECILIA, a costumer, turns from a costume to look at the
      window. Héctor's hand waves. She rolls her eyes and goes to
      open the window.

                            CECILIA
                  Ya lo sabía! I gotta dress forty
                  dancers by sunrise and thanks to

                  know. Ceci -- Ceci... Ceci.
                  Ceci...

      As Héctor tries to talk her down, Dante wanders away from
      the costume area.

                            MIGUEL
                  Dante... Dante!

      Miguel chases after him.


      INT. REHEARSAL AREA

                            MIGUEL
                  We shouldn't be in here...

      Miguel follows Dante through a giant warehouse, divided into
      different artists workspaces. He passes papier-mâché
      sculptures, giant paper cut out banners, a skeleton posing
      nude for a painter...

      Dante sniffs around. Suddenly an ALEBRIJE MONKEY jumps out
      at Dante. The monkey starts riding Dante, tormenting him.
      Miguel hustles after him.

                            MIGUEL
                  No, no, Dante! Ven acá!

      The monkey jumps up onto the shoulder of FRIDA KAHLO, the
      REAL Frida Kahlo, who stands in front of a rehearsal stage.
      Miguel reins Dante in just as Frida turns to find them.

                              FRIDA
                  You!    How did you get in here?

                            MIGUEL

      Frida's eyes go wide when she sees Dante.            She kneels and
      takes his head in her hands.

                             FRIDA
                  Oh, the mighty Xolo dog...! Guider
                  of wandering spirits...!
                      (beat)
                  And whose spirit have you guided to
                  me?

      Frida takes a closer look at Miguel.

                            MIGUEL
                  I don't think he's a spirit guide.

                            FRIDA
                  Ah-ah-ah. The alebrijes of this
                  world can take many forms... They
                  are as mysterious as they are
                  powerful...

      The patterns on Frida's monkey swirl and he opens his mouth
      to breath a blue fire. He fumbles at the end with a chesty
      cough.

      Then they look to Dante, who is chewing his own leg.
      Suddenly, Frida turns back to Miguel.

                            FRIDA (CONT'D)
                  Or maybe he's just a dog.        Come!    I
                  need your eyes!

      Frida guides him to view the rehearsal space.

                             FRIDA
                  You are the audience.

                  Darkness. And from the darkness...
                  A giant PAPAYA!

      Lights come up on a giant papaya prop.

                            FRIDA
                  Dancers emerge from the papaya and
                  the dancers are all me!

      Leotarded, unibrowed dancers crawl around the sides of the
      mesh papaya. Behind the papaya is an even larger half-
      finished mesh structure.





                                                                           58.


                            FRIDA (CONT'D)
                  And they go to drink from the milk
                  of their mother who is a cactus,
                  but who is also me. And her milk
                  is not milk but tears.
                      (to Miguel)
                  Is it too obvious?

                             MIGUEL
                  I think it's just the right amount
                  of obvious?
                      (beat)
                  It could use some music... Oh!
                  What if you did, like, doonk-doonk-
                  doonk-doonk...

      Frida, inspired, cues some musicians who start playing the
      tune.

                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)
                  Oh! And then it could go dittle-
                  ittle-dittle-ittle-dittle-ittle-
                  dittle-ittle -- WHAAA!

      The violins follow; a trombone punctuates.

                            FRIDA
                  And... what if everything was on
                  fire? Yes! Fire everywhere!

      The dancers gasp and look at each other, now concerned.

                            FRIDA
                  Inspired!
                      (leaning in)
                  You... you have the spirit of an
                  artist!

      Miguel brightens.     Frida turns back to the rehearsal.

                            FRIDA
                  The dancers exit, the music fades,
                  the lights go out! And Ernesto de
                  la Cruz rises to the stage!

      A silhouette rises from a trap door.         Miguel leans forward.

      A spotlight shines on the silhouette revealing it to be a
      mannequin.

                              MIGUEL
                  Huh?

                            FRIDA
                  He does a couple of songs, the sun
                  rises, everyone cheers--

      Miguel hustles up to Frida.

                            MIGUEL
                  Excuse me, where's the real de la
                  Cruz?

                            FRIDA
                  Ernesto doesn't do rehearsals.
                  He's too busy hosting that fancy
                  party at the top of his tower.

      She gestures out a large window to a GRAND ESTATE lit up in
      the distance, atop a steep hill.

      Suddenly Héctor rounds the corner, out of breath.

                            HÉCTOR
                  Chamaco! You can't run off on me
                  like that! C'mon, stop pestering
                  the celebrities...

      Héctor pulls Miguel away, but Miguel won't be wrangled.

                            MIGUEL
                  You said my great-great grandpa

                  That bum! Who doesn't show up to
                  his own rehearsal?

                            MIGUEL

                  come he didn't invite YOU?

      Héctor walks away from Miguel toward the musicians.

                            HÉCTOR

      Miguel looks to Héctor, eyebrow cocked.

                  I don't want to talk about it.

      The musicians laugh.     Miguel tries to stifle a giggle.

                            HÉCTOR
                  I didn't choke, okay -- I got food
                  poisoning, which is a big
                  difference!

      transformation.

                  I need to get my great-great

                  You know where I can get a guitar?

      Héctor sighs.

      EXT. UNDERPASS TUNNEL - NIGHT

      Pepita sweeps across the sky, landing in a darkened corner.
      She casts a shadow on the wall, then lurches into the light.
      She sniffs out the spot where Héctor painted Miguel's face,
      finding a canister of shoe polish. She lets out a low growl.

      The Dead Riveras follow after her.

                            MAMÁ IMELDA
                  Have you found him, Pepita?      Have
                  you found our boy?

      Pepita breathes on the ground, revealing a footprint.   It
      glows for a moment. The family leans in to inspect.

      Pepita leans forward, breathes again, and the glow spreads to
      reveal a trail of footprints.

      EXT. NARROW STAIRWAY

      Miguel follows Héctor down a steep stairway.     Miguel looks to
      his bony knuckles, concern on his face.

                            HÉCTOR
                  Why the heck would you wanna be a

                  My great-great grandpa was a

                            MIGUEL
                  Whadda you know?

      As Miguel descends the staircase, de la Cruz's distant
      glowing tower is obscured by old forgotten buildings.

                            MIGUEL
                  So, how far is this guitar anyway?

      Héctor jumps from the stairway and crashes on the ground
      below. But his bones reassemble immediately.

      Héctor leads Miguel through a stone archway.


      EXT. SHANTY TOWN

      Graffiti on the archway depicts skeletal angels with wings
      the color of marigolds.

      Inside the archway, a group of ratty skeletons huddle around
      a burning trashcan and laugh raucously. They are gray and
      dusty, not unlike Héctor, but there's a camaraderie about
      them.

      crate. One, TÍA CHELO looks up.

                  Cousin Héctor?


      INT. SHANTY BUNGALOW TENT

      Héctor holds the curtain open.       Miguel and Dante walk in.

      The tent is cramped, dark, and quiet. Piles are organized
      everywhere: stacks of old dishes, a drawer full of pocket
      watches, magazines, records. This place belongs to a
      collector of things. Miguel almost knocks one stack over.

      Héctor spies a hammock piled with old junk, a dusty hat on
      top. He lifts the hat and finds the grumpy face of
      CHICHARRÓN.

                            HÉCTOR
                  Buenas noches, Chicharrón!

                  face, Héctor.

                            HÉCTOR
                  I would, Cheech, but the thing
                  is... me and my friend, Miguel, we
                  really need to borrow your guitar.

                  I promise we'll bring it right
                  back.

      Chicharrón sits up, incensed.

                            CHICHARRÓN
                  Like the time you promised to bring
                  back my van?

                            CHICHARRÓN
                  Where's my femur?! You--

      Chicharrón raises his finger to give a tongue lashing. But
      then he weakens and collapses in his hammock, a golden
      flicker flashing through his bones. Héctor rushes forward.

                            HÉCTOR
                  Whoa, whoa -- you okay, amigo?

                             CHICHARRÓN

                  You want it, you got to earn it...

      Héctor sighs, then reaches over Chicharrón and takes the
      instrument.

                            HÉCTOR
                  Only for you, amigo.     Any requests?

      Héctor begins tuning the guitar.

                            CHICHARRÓN
                  You know my favorite, Héctor.

      Héctor begins a lovely, lilting tune. Chicharrón smiles.
      Miguel's eyes go wide at Héctor's skill.

      Héctor finishes with a soft flourish.

      Chicharrón is tickled, joyful.       For a moment he's present and
      bright.

                  Brings back memories.     Gracias...

      His eyes close.    He looks at peace.        Héctor looks sad.

      Suddenly, the edges of Chicharrón's bones begin to glow.         A
      soft, beautiful light. Then... he dissolves into dust.

      Miguel is stunned, concerned.

      Héctor picks up his shot glass, lifts it in honor, and
      drinks. He places it rim down next to Chicharrón's glass,
      which is still full.

      Héctor and Miguel hang off the back of a moving trolley.
      Miguel holds Héctor's photo in his hands, scanning it, while
      Héctor fiddles on the guitar idly.

      himself, Héctor softens.

      Miguel smiles, soaking in the moment.        He feels like a real
      musician.

                            HÉCTOR
                  Hey, you did good!     I'm proud of
                  you! Eso!

      Miguel swells and looks back out the crowd when he suddenly
      spots Oscar and Felipe talking to a stranger. He looks over
      and there is Tía Rosita talking to someone else! Miguel
      looks to stage right, where he sees Papá Julio talking to the
      Emcee!

                             AUDIENCE

      Panicking, Miguel pulls Héctor off stage.         Héctor tries to
      pull back.

                            MIGUEL
                  It's not stupid.

      Héctor grabs Miguel's arm and pulls him toward the stage.

                            HÉCTOR
                  I'm taking you to your family.

      Miguel yanks his arms away.

                            MIGUEL
                  You don't wanna help me, you only
                  care about yourself! Keep your
                  dumb photo!

      He pulls Héctor's photo out of his pocket and throws it at
      him. Héctor tries to grab it but it catches a breeze and
      drifts into the crowd.

                            HÉCTOR
                  No -- no, no, no!     No...

                            MIGUEL
                  Stay away from me!

      As Héctor scrambles to catch his photo, Miguel runs away.
      Héctor looks up but Miguel is gone.

                            HÉCTOR
                  Hey, chamaco! Where did you go?!
                  Chamaco! I'm sorry! Come back!


      EXT. PEDESTRIAN THOROUGHFARE

      Miguel hustles to get away from Héctor. Dante bounds after
      him, but looks back and whimpers. He barks to get Miguel's
      attention.

                            MIGUEL
                  Dante, cállate!

      But Dante is insistent.      He tugs at Miguel's pants, pulling
      him back to Héctor.

                               MIGUEL (CONT'D)
                  No, Dante!     Stop it! He can't help
                  me!

      Dante grabs onto his hoodie sleeve. Miguel tries to shake
      him off, but his hoodie slips off, revealing the arms of a
      living boy. Dante redoubles his efforts.

                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)
                  Dante, stop! Stop it! Leave me
                  alone! You're not a spirit guide,
                  you're just a dumb dog! Now get
                  out of here!

      Miguel yanks his hoodie away from Dante, who shrinks back,
      rebuffed. The scuffle has drawn the eyes of the crowd.




                                                                           79.


      Startled skeletons see Miguel's arms.        He hurries to get his
      hoodie back on.

                            CROWD MEMBERS
                  It's him! / It's that living boy! /
                  I heard about him. / Look! / He's
                  alive! / The boy's alive.

      Miguel runs and jumps down some scaffolding. In the
      distance, he sees de la Cruz's tower. After only a few
      paces, Pepita lands in front of Miguel, cutting off his path!
      He skids to a stop.

                               MIGUEL
                  AAHH!

      Then, peeking over the jaguar's head is an even more
      terrifying sight: Mamá Imelda riding atop.

                            MAMÁ IMELDA
                  This nonsense ends now, Miguel! I
                  am giving you my blessing and you
                  are going home!

                            MIGUEL
                  I don't want your blessing!

      Miguel scrambles upright and bounds for a narrow alley
      staircase.

                             MAMÁ IMELDA
                  Miguel!   Stop!

      Not able to get through on her spirit guide, Imelda is forced
      to pursue Miguel on foot.


      EXT. NARROW STAIRCASE

      He wriggles through an iron gate.

                  I am trying to save your life!

      She is stopped by the gate.

                            MIGUEL
                  You're ruining my life!





                                                                        80.


                              MAMÁ IMELDA
                  What?

                             MIGUEL
                  Music's the only thing that makes
                  me happy. And you, you wanna take
                  that away!
                      (beat)
                  You'll never understand.

      Miguel heads away from her up the stairs.

                            MAMÁ IMELDA
                      (singing)
                  Y AUNQUE LA VIDA ME CUESTE,
                  LLORONA... NO DEJARÉ DE QUERERTE...

      Miguel stops in his tracks.      When Imelda finishes, he turns
      back, confused.

                            MIGUEL
                  I thought you hated music.

                            MAMÁ IMELDA
                  Oh, I loved it.
                      (reminiscing)
                  I remember that feeling, when my
                  husband would play, and I would
                  sing and nothing else mattered.
                  But when we had Coco, suddenly...
                  there was something in my life that
                  mattered more than music. I wanted
                  to put down roots. He wanted to
                  play for the world.

      Mamá Imelda pauses for a moment, lost in a memory.

                            MAMÁ IMELDA (CONT'D)
                  We each made a sacrifice to get
                  what we wanted. Now you must make
                  a choice.

                             MIGUEL
                  But I don't wanna... pick sides!
                      (beat)
                  Why can't you be on MY side?
                  That's what family's supposed to do

                  But you never will.

      Miguel wipes the corner of his eye, frustrated. Imelda is
      shocked to see him so hurt, but Miguel turns away before she
      can answer and ascends the narrow staircase toward de la
      Cruz's tower.


      EXT. BOTTOM OF THE TOWER

      Miguel arrives at the foot of the hill to de la Cruz's tower.

      Vehicles from all eras (limousines, motor cars, carriages)
      drop off finely dressed guests who line up to get aboard a
      funicular that scales the tower to the mansion.

      A couple at the front of the line show a fancy invitation to
      a SECURITY GUARD, who then lets them onto the funicular.

                            SECURITY GUARD
                  Have a good time.

                            GUEST
                  Oh, how exciting!

      EL SANTO, the silver-masked luchador, produces a fancy
      invitation to the security guard.

                            SECURITY GUARD
                  Oh!  El Santo!
                      (giddy)
                  I'm a big fan.

      The security guard sheepishly holds up a camera.

                            SECURITY GUARD
                  You mind if I--

      El Santo nods. The security guard removes his head and hands
      it to the luchador for a selfie. His body proceeds to take
      the photo.

                            SECURITY GUARD
                  Gracias, señor!

      The security guard puts his head back on and El Santo heads
      past the velvet rope. Miguel is revealed waiting in line
      behind him.

                            SECURITY GUARD
                  Invitation?

                            MIGUEL

      Miguel strikes de la Cruz's signature pose with his guitar.

                                                   CUT TO:

      Miguel is tossed out of the line. Just then he sees Los
      Chachalacos unloading their instruments from their van. He
      runs up to them.

                            MIGUEL
                  Disculpen, señores...

                                                   CUT TO:

      The Band Leader hands an invitation to the security guard.

                            SECURITY GUARD
                  Ooo, the competition winners!
                  Congratulations chicos!

      Los Chachalacos file onto the funicular, the sousaphone
      player angling his instrument away from the security guard.
      After they get onto the funicular, he turns to reveal a pair
      of legs hanging out of the bell of the sousaphone. With a
      deep "TOOT!" Miguel spills out onto the floor of the
      funicular.

                            MIGUEL
                  Thanks guys!

      The funicular ascends.

      EXT. DE LA CRUZ'S MANSION

      The doors of the funicular open to reveal de la Cruz's lavish
      mansion. Los Chachalacos all file out.

                  Gracias!

      Miguel heads off toward the mansion.

      On the stairs leading up, the party is bustling --
      performers, servers and guests dressed to the nines.

      A fire breather lets out flames that transform into a flurry
      of butterflies.

                            GUEST
                  Look, it's Ernesto!

      Miguel catches a glimpse of de la Cruz heading deeper into
      the party. Miguel pursues.

                            MIGUEL
                  De la Cruz...


      INT. DE LA CRUZ'S MANSION

      Miguel heads into the foyer but loses de la Cruz in the
      crowd.

                  Señor de la Cruz!

      Miguel elbows his way through the room.

                  Pardon me, Señor de la Cruz!     Señor
                  de la--

      He finds himself in a huge hall with hundreds of guests, the
      heart of the party. Film clips play all around the room from
      de la Cruz's movies.

                  must seize it.

      Miguel takes it all in. Synchronized swimmers make
      formations in a sparkling indoor pool. A DJ lays a decades-
      spanning mash-up soundtrack.

      A clip of de la Cruz riding his noble steed plays behind
      Miguel.

      Miguel is unable to get his great-great grandfather's

      The passionate words embolden Miguel. He climbs a pillar to
      the landing of a grand staircase, he stands above the crowd.

      Miguel takes a breath and throws out a grito as loud as he
      can. It echoes through the space, and party guests turn.
      The DJ fades the music.

      Garnering some attention, Miguel plays his guitar.   More
      guests turn.

      As a hush falls on the crowd, the sound of Miguel's guitar
      becomes singular.

                            MIGUEL
                  I just met him tonight.      He told me
                  he knew you--

      As Héctor steps forward with the photo, de la Cruz slowly
      recognizes him.

                            DE LA CRUZ
                  Hé-- Héctor?

                            HÉCTOR
                  Please Miguel, put my photo up.

      Héctor pushes the photo into Miguel's hands.          De la Cruz
      intercepts it.

      He looks from the picture to the gray, faded skeleton who
      kneels before him. Héctor looks weak.

                            DE LA CRUZ
                  My friend... you're being
                  forgotten...

                            HÉCTOR
                  And whose fault is that?

                            DE LA CRUZ
                  Héctor, please--

                            HÉCTOR
                  Those were MY songs you took.     MY
                  songs that made YOU famous.

                              MIGUEL
                  W-What?

                            HÉCTOR
                  If I'm being forgotten, it's
                  because you never told anyone that
                  I wrote them--

                            MIGUEL
                  That's crazy, de la Cruz wrote all
                  his own songs.

      he composes himself.

      alone with de la Cruz.

                  Yes.   Uh... sí.

      De la Cruz pulls up a marigold petal, but hesitates.

                            DE LA CRUZ
                  Miguel, my reputation, it is very
                  important to me. I would hate to

                  I -- no! Everyone knows you're
                  the... the good guy.

      Doubt enters Miguel's mind. De la Cruz darkens, he places
      the photo of Héctor in his coat pocket, gears turning in his
      mind.




                                                                     97.

                  your moment. I know      you
                  understand.

      Miguel is dragged away.

                  Let go!

      They throw him into a cenote, an inescapable sinkhole behind
      the estate.

      He falls four stories and splashes into the pool at the
      bottom of the hole. He breaks the surface and swims to a
      stone island in the center.

                           MIGUEL
                  Help! Can anyone hear me?        I wanna
                  go home!

      Miguel collapses on the stone island.

      His soaked hoodie sags off his shoulders.        The skeletal
      transition is almost complete.

      A moment of silence.     He is alone.

      Suddenly, Miguel hears a noise. Footsteps. Héctor emerges
      from the darkness, looking beat up. Héctor stumbles.

                              MIGUEL
                  Héctor?

                              HÉCTOR

                            MIGUEL
                  Oh, Héctor!

      They run to each other.      Héctor embraces Miguel.   But Miguel
      is overcome with shame.

                            MIGUEL
                  You were right. I should have gone
                  back to my family--

      Héctor tries to calm him but Miguel is shaking.

                            HÉCTOR
                  Hey -- hey, hey...

                            MIGUEL
                  They told me not to be like de la
                  Cruz, but I didn't listen--

                            HÉCTOR
                  Hey, it's okay...

                            MIGUEL
                  I told them I didn't care if they
                  remembered me. I didn't care if I
                  was on their stupid ofrenda.

      Héctor holds Miguel to his chest.       Miguel is tense.





                                                                         99.

                  okay.

                            MIGUEL
                  I told them I didn't care.

      Suddenly, a golden flicker flutters through Héctor's bones,
      and he falls to his knees.

                              HÉCTOR

                  Coco?

      Miguel reaches into his hoodie and pulls out the photo of
      Imelda, Coco, and the faceless musician.

      Miguel shows the photo to Héctor.       Héctor is confused; it's
      like he's seen a ghost.





                                                                          100.

      Héctor is as shocked as Miguel.       He looks at his great-great
      grandson.

      He looks to the photo, touches the image of baby Coco, and he
      becomes saddened.

                   You know, I wrote her a song once.

      They trade off their gritos until the cenote echoes with the
      sound. Soon though, the echoes fade. They're still stuck.
      Suddenly they hear a distant howling.

      Dante pants and wags his tail happily. Behind him Pepita
      peeks down through the hole and gives a powerful roar.
      Pepita's call shakes the cavern. She lowers her head to
      reveal Mamá Imelda riding atop her. Miguel and Mamá Imelda
      laugh with joy. Until her gaze falls upon Héctor.

      Pepita flies out of the cenote; Imelda, Héctor, Miguel, and
      Dante ride on her back. She ascends above the clouds.

      Miguel, wind in his hair, hugs Dante fiercely.

      Dante smiles at Miguel dumbly. Suddenly, before Miguel's
      eyes, neon patterns spread outward from the dog's paws.
      Dante begins to freak out.

                              MIGUEL
                  Whoa...

      A pair of little wings sprout on the dog's back. He spreads

      But then he's back up, flapping goofily and barking his head
      off, a full-blown spirit guide!


      EXT. SMALL PLAZA

      Pepita flies in, landing in a small plaza where the other
      Riveras wait.

      They dismount from Pepita. Héctor falls off first but gets
      up and raises his arm to help Imelda. She gives him a
      withering stare and dismounts without his help. Miguel pets
      Dante and Pepita gives Miguel a big lick.

      Imelda rounds Pepita's shoulder and folds Miguel into a tight
      hug.

                              MAMÁ IMELDA
                  What?

                            MIGUEL
                  So he can see Coco again.        Héctor
                  should be on our ofrenda.        He's
                  part of our family--

      Startled, she looks to Héctor for confirmation.

                  It's true, Imelda.

      Imelda wrestles with her emotions.

                            MAMÁ IMELDA
                  And so what if it's true? You

      Héctor's body suddenly shimmers, leaving him winded.   Imelda
      gasps.

      EXT. SUNRISE SPECTACULAR AMPHITHEATER - BEFORE DAWN

      Crowds are congregated at de la Cruz's Sunrise Spectacular
      which takes place in an open air amphitheater. They hurry to
      their seats as the lights begin to dim.


      ON STAGE

      Frida's performance piece begins. Dramatic symphonic music
      plays as a giant papaya appears to ignite on stage. The
      "seeds" in the body of the papaya unfurl to reveal that they
      are dancers, each dressed like Frida Kahlo, right down to the
      painted on unibrow.

      The dancers roll out of the "flaming" papaya and gyrate their
      bodies nonsensically.

      A giant cactus that resembles Frida is illuminated, and all
      the dancers slink to it.

      In the midst of this, eight familiar looking dancers (the
      Dead Riveras and Miguel) inch their way out of the spotlights
      and to the wings of the stage.


      STAGE WING

                             FRIDA

      INT. BACKSTAGE CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

      The Dead Riveras congregate in a hidden backstage corridor,
      shedding their Frida outfits. Miguel rips off his unibrow.

                              MIGUEL
                   Ow!

      Dante has snuck in under Tío Oscar's skirt.   Héctor sees that
      Imelda is tangled up in her outfit.

                             HÉCTOR
                   Here, let me help you with--

                             MAMÁ IMELDA

                            HÉCTOR
                  Got your petals?

      Each family member raises a marigold petal.   Imelda leads the
      way out of the corridor.

                            MAMÁ IMELDA
                  Now, we just have to find de la
                  Cruz--

      Right around the corner is de la Cruz who turns with a smile.

                              DE LA CRUZ
                  Yes?

                              MAMÁ IMELDA
                  Ah!

      The family stops in their tracks, still hidden from de la
      Cruz's view. It's just him and Imelda. His smile drops.

                            DE LA CRUZ
                  Don't I know you?

      Imelda pulls off her shoe and slaps de la Cruz across the
      face with it.

                            MAMÁ IMELDA
                  That's for murdering the love of my

      Héctor leaps out from around the corner.

                  you.

                              DE LA CRUZ
                  Héctor?!    How did you--

      Imelda slaps de la Cruz again.

                            MAMÁ IMELDA
                  And that's for trying to murder my
                  grandson!

      Now Miguel leaps out of the corridor.

                            MIGUEL
                  She's talking about me!

      De la Cruz sees the three of them and puts the pieces
      together.

                           DE LA CRUZ
                  You! Wait, you're related to
                  Héctor?

      Miguel sees the photo in de la Cruz's pocket.

                               MIGUEL
                  The photo!

      The rest of the Riveras emerge from the corridor.
      Outnumbered, de la Cruz turns and runs.

                               MAMÁ IMELDA
                  After him!


      INT. BELOW STAGE

      De la Cruz knocks over a group of giant sugar skull dancers.
      He emerges at a full sprint to where his rising platform is
      set up.

                               DE LA CRUZ
                  Security!     Ayúdenme!

      The Riveras flood out after him.        Héctor jogs next to Imelda.

                            HÉCTOR
                  You said "love of your life..."

                            MAMÁ IMELDA
                  I don't know WHAT I said!

                            MIGUEL
                  That's what I heard...

      A brawl ensues between the family and the guards.

      De la Cruz runs to a stage door.

                            STAGEHAND
                  Places, señor, you're on in 30
                  seconds!

      De la Cruz shoves the stagehand out of the way.

      As security guards try to wrangle the Riveras, Imelda reaches
      de la Cruz and gets her hands on Héctor's photo. De la Cruz
      scuffles with her to get it back, when Miguel tackles de la
      Cruz to the ground. De la Cruz loses his grip; Imelda
      tumbles backward, photo in hand.

                             MAMÁ IMELDA
                  Miguel!   I have it!

      Miguel turns toward Imelda but is chased by guards.

      Suddenly, Imelda rises into the air. She is on de la Cruz's
      rising platform! She is lifted through the ceiling and up to
      the stage.

      De la Cruz hurries up the stairs after her.

      Miguel is detained by a security guard when Dante flies in
      and knocks the guard's head clean off. Miguel, Héctor, Tía
      Victoria, and Tía Rosita hurry up the stairs after de la
      Cruz.

                            MIGUEL
                  Hurry, come on!

      Papá Julio, Tío Oscar, and Tío Felipe block the guards from
      following the others.

      The platform rises onto the stage and the spotlight falls on
      Imelda. Neon letters blast brightly behind her, spelling
      "ERNESTO!" The audience bursts into applause!

      De la Cruz rushes up a staircase and arrives in the wings.
      He gets the attention of his guards and points to Imelda.

      her.


      STAGE WING LEFT

      Miguel, Héctor, Victoria, and Rosita emerge to see Imelda
      spotlit above them.


      ON STAGE

      De la Cruz's guards begin to approach Imelda.   She is frozen,
      unable to move.

      STAGE WING LEFT

      Héctor's mouth gapes open.      Tía Victoria and Tía Rosita go
      wide-eyed.

      Miguel sets Héctor up with a guitar, then adjusts a mic stand
      in front of him. Héctor plays the guitar, its sound
      amplified through the stage speakers.

      The guards reach the edge of her spotlight but stop short,
      not wanting to interrupt the performance.

      Imelda takes the spotlight with her as she descends the on
      stage staircase. As she comes down, she makes eye contact
      with her husband in the wing. He smiles as he accompanies
      her. Imelda's eyes glint, touched to see him supporting her.

                            MAMÁ IMELDA

      As Héctor accompanies Imelda, she becomes more confident.
      The audience begins to clap.

      De la Cruz grunts in frustration.

      Soon, the stage conductor joins with more instrumentation,
      which kicks into high gear.

      She doubles down on her performance, taking the spotlight
      with her as she moves to put distance between her and the
      guards.

      Imelda continues to vamp, trying to navigate away from the
      guards and toward her family. One guard blocks her way, but
      she grabs him and forces him to dance. Scared of the
      spotlight, he runs away.

      He dances Imelda around the stage, all the while trying to
      get to Héctor's photo.

                            DE LA CRUZ/MAMÁ IMELDA

                  ...AY, AY, AY!

      At the finale of the song, Imelda stomps her heel into de la
      Cruz's foot on his high note, causing him to let her go. She
      runs off stage with the photo.


      BACKSTAGE

      Imelda arrives off stage and, somewhat high on adrenaline,
      she embraces Héctor.

                            MAMÁ IMELDA
                  I forgot what that felt like.

      Héctor is taken by surprise. Imelda, realizing the
      impropriety, pulls away from him awkwardly.

                            HÉCTOR
                  You... still got it.

      They smile at each other, softening.         Miguel, off to the
      side, clears his throat.

                  Oh!

      Imelda, now reminded, gives Miguel the photo.         She pulls out
      her petal.

                            MAMÁ IMELDA
                  Miguel, I give you my blessing.

      The petal glows.

                  And to never...

      Miguel looks slightly saddened, anticipating the condition.

                            MIGUEL
                  Never play music again...

      Imelda smiles.

                            MAMÁ IMELDA
                  To never... forget how much your
                  family loves you.

      The petal surges.      Miguel brightens, touched.

                            HÉCTOR
                  You're going home.

                            DE LA CRUZ
                  You're not going anywhere!

      Suddenly Miguel is yanked away from his great-great
      grandparents by de la Cruz. De la Cruz has grabbed Miguel by
      the scruff of his hoodie.

      Imelda lunges at de la Cruz, but he pushes her to the floor.

                               HÉCTOR
                  Imelda--

      De la Cruz drags Miguel away as his family encroaches.

      De la Cruz drags Miguel further and further back on the
      stage.

                               DE LA CRUZ
                  Stay back!     Not one more step.

      Dante growls and tries to grab Miguel.

                               MIGUEL
                  Dante!

      De la Cruz pulls Miguel away, closer to the ledge of the
      building.

      Héctor struggles but continues pursuing de la Cruz.

      Héctor stumbles, shimmering like before.        He falls to the
      ground.

                            DE LA CRUZ
                  I've worked too hard, Héctor...
                  Too hard to let him destroy
                  everything...

      In the stage wings, Tía Rosita commandeers one of the cameras
      and points it toward de la Cruz. Tía Victoria sidles up to a
      control board and pushes a volume dial up.

      De la Cruz crosses from the ledge, past Héctor, who remains
      collapsed on the floor, breathless.

                  Apologies old friend, but the show

      Miguel is in free fall, the photo still in his hand. As the
      wind whips against his face, he hears a faint howling.

      Dante slices downward through the air, catches Miguel's shirt
      in his teeth, and opens his wings. He and Miguel jerk
      upward, but the photo falls from Miguel's hands and is gone
      from sight.

      Miguel and Dante twist in the air, Dante trying to slow their
      decent but the two of them are too heavy. Miguel's shirt
      rips and Dante loses him.

      Miguel plummets toward the base of the tower. Suddenly
      Pepita flies in and scoops up Miguel. Dante follows close
      behind. Miguel looks over the side of Pepita down towards
      the water.

      The photo is lost.

      Crowd members point up to the screen. Pepita rises above the
      ledge with Miguel on her back. Miguel slides off her wing
      and runs to his family.

      The crowd cheers.     There are sighs of relief.

      De la Cruz, seeing this     play out on screen, realizes his
      backstage treachery has     been projected to the whole world.
      He watches horrified as     the image of Pepita grows larger and
      larger on the screen as     she prowls past the camera.

      De la Cruz begins to back up just as Pepita emerges through
      the curtain, eyes locked on him.

      sky, flinging the singer in the air like a kitten playing
      with a ball of yarn.

      She swings him around to gain momentum, then throws him over
      the audience.

      He flies out of the stadium, hitting a giant church bell in
      the distance. The stadium erupts in cheers.

      In the midst of the cheering, an unsuspecting crowd member
      returns from concessions.

      Héctor looks at Miguel. The skeletal transformation is
      creeping in on the edges of Miguel's face. He's almost full
      skeleton now.

                  We're both out of time, mijo.

                   No...

      WHOOOOSH! A whirlwind of marigold petals, and everything

      INT. DE LA CRUZ'S MAUSOLEUM - SUNRISE

      Miguel finds himself back in de la Cruz's tomb.

      Dazed, he looks through the windows; day has broken.

      On the floor is the skull guitar. Miguel grabs it.      He exits
      the tomb and takes off out of the cemetery.

      EXT. PLAZA

      Miguel races through the plaza, past the statue of de la
      Cruz.

      Miguel races through the streets towards home. He blows
      right past his Tío Berto snoring and Primo Abel sleeping on a
      bench.

                             TÍO BERTO
                       (jolting awake)
                   There he is!

      Abel falls off the bench.

      Papá comes from around a corner as Miguel is running.

                              PAPÁ

      EXT. RIVERA COMPOUND

      Miguel rounds the corner and follows the trail of marigolds
      through the front gate.

      He runs for Mamá Coco's bedroom. Just as he makes it to the
      doorway, Abuelita steps up and blocks him.

                            ABUELITA
                  Where have you been?!

                           MIGUEL
                  Ah! I need to see Mamá Coco,
                  please--

      Abuelita spies the guitar in Miguel's hand.

                            ABUELITA
                  What are you doing with that?     Give
                  it to me!

      Miguel pushes past Abuelita, and slams the door shut.

                             ABUELITA
                  Miguel!   Stop! Miguel!      Miguel!
                  Miguel!   MIGUEL!


      INT. MAMÁ COCO'S ROOM

      Miguel locks the door and goes up to Mamá Coco.      She stares
      into space, eyes completely vacant.

                               MIGUEL
                  Mamá Coco?     Can you hear me?   It's
                  Miguel.

      Miguel looks into her eyes.

                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)
                  I saw your papá. Remember? Papá?

                  be gone... forever!

      She doesn't respond.      Miguel's father bangs on the door.

                            PAPÁ (O.S.)

                  He used to play it to you? See,
                  there he is.

      Still nothing.    Her eyes are glazed.

                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)
                  Papá, remember? Papá?

      Mamá Coco stares forward, as if Miguel isn't even there.

                  Mamá Coco, please, don't forget
                  him.

      With a rattle of keys, the door flies open.    The family pours
      in.

                            ABUELITA
                  What are you doing to that poor
                  woman?

      Abuelita brushes Miguel aside to comfort her mother.

                            ABUELITA
                  It's okay, Mamita, it's okay.

                            PAPÁ
                  What's gotten into you?

      Miguel looks down, defeated. Tears drip off his nose.
      Papá's anger gives way to relief. He embraces his son.

                            PAPÁ
                  I thought I'd lost you, Migue...

                            MIGUEL
                  Mamá Coco...

      His toe accidentally taps against Héctor's skull guitar, a
      soft hollow ringing resonates.

                             ABUELITA
                  Well?   Apologize.

      He comes to a realization.

                            MIGUEL
                  Mamá Coco? Your papá -- he wanted
                  you to have this.

      He picks up the guitar. Abuelita steps forward to intervene
      but Papá places a hand on her shoulder.

                            PAPÁ
                  Mamá, wait--

      Miguel starts to sing "Remember Me" the way Héctor sang it...
      softly, from the heart.

      arc into a smile.

      Miguel sings gently, with love.

      Mamá Coco's brows slope up, delighted.          The song seems to
      bring her back to life.

      Abuelita can't speak.     None of them can.

      Brimming, Mamá Coco joins Miguel in song -- her voice
      scratchy with age, his clear with youth.

      Tears stream down Abuelita's face; she's witnessing a
      miracle.

      Mamá Coco looks to her daughter, and is troubled by her
      tears.

                  loved you so much.

      A smile spreads across Mamá Coco's face.          She's waited a long
      time to hear those words.

      She turns to her nightstand, hand shaking.          She opens a
      drawer and pulls out a notebook.

      Mamá Coco leafs through the book to reveal a torn scrap of
      paper. She hands it to Miguel. It's the missing face from
      the photo -- Héctor's face.

      Miguel pieces the picture back together, finally seeing
      Héctor as he was in life, a young, handsome man.

      Mamá Coco smiles. She finds the words slowly, but she speaks
      with fondness and love.

      Dante's shadow is cast against a wall. When he rounds the
      corner, he is just a normal xolo dog, no wings or vibrant
      colors. Pepita's shadow looms large, but as she rounds the
      corner it shrinks to reveal that she is a little alley cat in
      the Land of the Living.


      EXT. RIVERA COURTYARD

      They enter the Rivera compound. Abuelita greets Dante and
      tosses him a sweet treat. In the courtyard, the family is
      gathered as Miguel plays his guitar and sings. Dante hops up
      to give him a lick on the cheek.

      Amongst the living Riveras are the spirits of their loved
      ones, Tía Rosita, Tía Victoria, Papá Julio, Tío Oscar and Tío
      Felipe, all present and enjoying the reunion.

      Abel and Rosa accompany Miguel with instruments of their own.
      Papá cradles Miguel's new baby sister as Mamá leans on his
      shoulder. Abuelita listens proudly to her grandchildren
      while the spirit of Mamá Coco stands beside, arm around her
      shoulder.

      The courtyard is full of Riveras, living and dead. Héctor
      and Imelda stand arm in arm, listening to Miguel play. As
      Miguel sings, the whole family, living and dead, all sing,
      play and enjoy the music.

      The whole family, brought together by a song.
